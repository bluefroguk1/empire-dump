The sun shall not rise without you
Dark are the skies without you
I shall have no sleep
All night my vigil keep

The tide shall not turn without you
No fire shall burn without you
I'll wait by the shore
Until you come once more

Here I must stay without you
Another day without you
Silent and alone
While you are gone
