## Overview
The Jotun have requested a further two year extension of the current ceasefire between them and the Empire.

## Date
* [[Extension of Jotun Ceasefire#Rejection|Rejected Spring Equinox 378YE]] - [[378YE_Spring_Equinox_Synod_judgements#Synod_Judgments|Vetoed by the Synod]]
* [[Extension of Jotun Ceasefire#Accepted|Accepted Spring Equinox 378YE]]

## Accepted
To extend the treaty with the Jotun.

Proposed by Bastion, seconded by Hahnmark.

### Overview
* Accept the proposed extension to the [[Accept Jotun ceasefire|Jotun ceasefire]] treaty.
* A prior motion to reject the ceasefire was [[veto|vetoed]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].

### Campaign Outcome
* The Senate agreed to accept the proposed extension. The treaty will now end at the start of the Spring Equinox summit 380YE.

### Constitution
A motion that is vetoed by the Imperial Synod would not normally be eligible to be raised again at that Summit. However this rule exists to ensure that the Senate are not able to circumvent the oversight of the Synod. In this situation, where it is clear that the Senate wished to take account of the views of the Synod and time was pressing, it is reasonable for the motion to be raised again.
