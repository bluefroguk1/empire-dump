## Overview
The Steward of the Sarvos Mana Exchange is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a [[The League|League]] citizen. 
## Responsibilities
The Steward is responsible for ensuring that all business taking place at the Sarvos Mana Exchange is above board, although the actual day-to-day running of the Exchange is handled by officers who are well paid for their work. In the event that the Exchange was threatened, they would be expected to deal with those threats; they might also be called on to make decisions about the broad policies of the Exchange such as whether certain nations or individuals should be prevented from trading, and so on. In return, the agents of the Exchange appraise the Steward of opportunities to purchase crystal mana at bargain prices.

The Sarvos Mana Exchange is a [[ministry]]. The Steward can purchase quantities of crystal mana at a set price. The Steward makes their decision how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

==Appointment== 
The Steward of the Sarvos Mana Exchange is appointed during the Spring Equinox each year by unanimous decision of the [[senator|senators]] of [[the League]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 

The title can be held by a citizen of the League. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the League [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Sarvos Mana Exchange
The Sarvos Mana Exchange was commissioned by Cesare Sanguineo Rezia Di Tassato of the Gilded Horn Carta during the Winter Solstice 381YE  to take advantage of an [[Fly_high#Opportunity_:_Tassato_Mana_Exchange|opportunity]] to construct branches of the [[Steward of the Tassato Mana Exchange#Tassato Mana Exchange|Tassato Mana Exchange]] in other League cities. The work was paid for and completed by Lorenzo 'La Volpe' of the Bloody Butchers Guild of Temeschwar whose construction of the [[great work|great works]] known as [[Lorenzo's_Legacy#The_Legacies_of_Virtue|Lorenzo's Legacies of Virtue]] had led to a significant increase in mana production.

The market follows a similar design to the [[Magic_Butcher#The_Temeschwar_Mana_Exchange|Temeschwar Mana Exchange]] which was built at the same time. A four storey building with multi-levelled white granite porticoes houses the Exchange. Several sublevels house reinforced vaults and mithril-infused wards against scrying and intrusion. The business of the Mana Exchange is the sale and purchase of crystal mana. While many of the customers are League citizens, the Exchange is open to customers from across the Empire and beyond. 

As with the Temeschwar branch, Lorenzo wanted to build the Exchange in or near a large meat market, but such things are not common in Sarvos proper - abattoirs and meat markets are much more common on the mainland . Rather the Mana Exchange stands on Salsiccia Street, a narrow avenue known for its artisanal butchers and gourmet sausage makers. As with other structures paid for by ''La Volpe'', heraldry of the  Butchers Guild and images of crossed cleavers and blood drops are prominently displayed throughout the building.

Following the [[Expand Mana Ministries|decision]] of the Imperial Senate in Spring 384YE, the exchange was expanded slightly to allow the civil service to increase the amount of mana they could [[Grandmaster#Funding the Order|purchase on behalf off]] the [[Grandmaster|grandmasters]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]].
