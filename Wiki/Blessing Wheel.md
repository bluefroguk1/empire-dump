## Description
Also known as a ''Spirit Spindle'', ''Spinning Wheel'' or ''Hallowing Wheel'', a Blessing Wheel is a tool used by priests, specifically during the [[hallow]] ceremony. It commonly takes the form of a cylindrical wheel on a spindle, or a circular disc mounted on a rod. The device is marked with symbols of the Way - most commonly a straightforward Labyrinth or Wheel design traced across the entire wheel, over which are painted seven sigils which correspond to the seven Virtues at roughly equidistant points. 

A priest engaged in hallowing an item sets the wheel spinning, and keeps it spinning throughout the ceremony. Often, the priest places the tool next to a small bowl in which liao is mixed with oil or water. They moisten their fingers, touch the wheel to keep it spinning, and then touch the item that is the target of the hallow. The movement of the wheel serves not only to focus the attention of the priest but also as a metaphor for the cycle of reincarnation.

Some priests, especially in [[the Marches]] and among the [[Dawn|Dawnish]] [[Yeofolk of Dawn|yeofolk]] embrace a more practical symbology when using a Blessing Wheel - especially a circular rather than cylindrical one. They draw similarities between the priestly tool and a more mundane spinning wheel and talk about "spinning" the raw stuff of spirituality out of the Labyrinth and wrapping it around the item they are working with. When removing an unwanted aura, these priests are careful to spin the Blessing Wheel the "other way", pulling the unwanted spiritual essence away from the item and flinging it back out into the Labyrinth.

In parts of [[Urizen]], [[Navarr]], and [[Varushka]], and among the [[Kallavesi]] and the [[Suaq]], a Blessing Wheel takes the form of a hoop bound within which is a web of cords or thongs. Charms or symbolic items are hung from the strands of the network - depictions of the [[Varushka_religious_beliefs#The_Virtuous_Animals|virtuous animals]] in Varushka, crystal or glass sigils in Urizen, feathers or bone runecharms for the Kalalvesi and the Suaq, coloured beads for the Navarr, Rather than being spun, the net created by the crisscrossing strands is studied and adjusted throughout the ceremony - sometimes restrung completely as part of the process of hallowing the item. As well as serving as a focus for the priest, these delicate tools are used to draw symbolic connections between the item that is to be hallowed and people, places, and things that exemplify the aura the priest seeks to create. For example, a priest who works to create a [[Auras of Courage#Hallowing of Inga Tarn|Hallowing of Inga Tarn]] might trace the net held within the hoop while quietly reciting the story of one of the exemplar's heroic journeys, and perhaps go so far as to hang a miniature hammer charm from one of the strands.

## Rules

* Effect: When you [[Religious skills#Performing a Ceremony|perform]] or [[Religious skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with the performance of the [[hallow]] skill, you may spend up to three additional doses of [[liao]] to increase the [[Religious_skills#Ceremony_Strength|strength]] or the ceremony by the same amount.
* Materials: Crafting a Blessing Wheel requires three ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]], five measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]], seven measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], and three measures of [[materials#Iridscent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
