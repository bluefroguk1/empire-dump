## Overview
The Merchant to Skoura is an [[Imperial title]]  awarded to a citizen of [[Urizen]]. It is a national position appointed by unanimous decision of the Urizen [[senator|senators]].The Skouran Trade Enclave was commissioned during the [[Construct_Trade_Enclave_in_Axos|Autumn Equinox 383YE]] and work was finished shortly before the Spring Equinox 384YE. Following the Spring Equinox 385YE, the Axou closed the offices of the Merchant to Skoura, angry at both their erstwhile allies and the Empire for their roll in the failure of the [[Roll_and_fall|Tsark raid]]. The title still exists, but receives no access to the ministry established in Axos.
## Responsibilities
The Merchant to Skoura worked alongside Axou traders in the Towers of Kantor in providing [[dragonbone]] for trade with the miners of the Skouran hills.
