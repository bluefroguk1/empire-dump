## Overview
Each of the eight [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|virtue assemblies]] appoints a [[Cardinal]] to represent and lead them. The Cardinal of [[the Way]] represents Assembly of The Way, and is part of what is arguably the post powerful of the Assemblies, the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]]. While they are still able to raise only a single [[judgement]] for consideration by their peers in the [[Imperial Synod]] each season, they possess a number of specific legal powers that allow them to guide and influence the Assemblies. 

The recent [[Benevolence,_inspiration,_and_legacy|Severin encyclical]] prompted a [[Without_a_plea_for_mercy|great deal of discussion]] around the role of the cardinals in the [[Imperial Synod]]. 

## Responsibilities
The Cardinal of the Way is assumed to provide leadership to the priests and pilgrims who do not prioritise any one particular virtue. They are expected to be well versed in matters of [[the Way]] in general, so that they can speak with authority on matters related to the wider practice of the faith, and of [[The Doctrines of the Faith|doctrine]]. Prominent citizens who are guilty of breaking the law but believe their actions were rooted in understanding of the Way may sometimes approach the Cardinal to plead [[clemency]] on their behalf, so a familiarity with the law may also prove helpful.

As a member of the Assembly of the Nine, the Cardinal of the Way can wield considerable influence over the politics of the Empire. In particular the Assembly has the power to [[veto]] any constitutional motion passed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. This allows the Assembly to uphold their constitutional obligation to "ensure the virtuous behaviour of the Empire".


## Powers
### Cardinal of the Way
The Cardinal of the Way has the powers common to all [[cardinal|cardinals]]: [[Cardinal#Member of the Assembly of Nine|membership]] of the Assembly of the Nine; the ability to call for [[Cardinal#Further Scrutiny|further scrutiny]] on a [[judgement]] raised in any assembly by a [[member of the Synod]] (rather than by the [[Tribune of the Synod|Tribunes]]); [[Cardinal#Appoint the Gatekeeper|appoint]] the [[Conscience of the Senate]] and any other [[Imperial Title|titles]] designated as [[Cardinal#Virtuous Appointments|virtuous appointments]] selected by the Cardinal of the Assembly of the Way.

### Virtue Appointments
A virtue title might be designed in such a way that it is appointed by the Cardinal alone. Currently they have the power to appoint the [[Conscience of the Senate]], a powerful political position that represents the faithful of the Empire in the [[Imperial Senate]], and the [[Imperial Chaplain Consular]], responsible for the Virtue of the Ambassadors selected by the Senate.

### Additional Powers
The Cardinal of the Way may possess additional powers, not shared with their fellow cardinals, either through the action of the [[Imperial Senate]] or through [[opportunity|opportunities]] presented to them. Occasionally, a particularly virtuous Imperial citizen may look specifically to the cardinal for inspiration. Using such powers generally requires them to raise a [[judgement]] in the Assembly of the Nine.

## Appointment
The Cardinal of the Way is appointed during the Winter Solstice by the Assembly of the Way, and must be a member of that assembly. Selection is by a judgement of [[appointment]] raised by the Tribune in the standard manner.

The elections for the cardinals are considered to be legally equivalent positions restricted by virtue. This means that if you change your virtue assembly then you must abstain from voting in a election if it occurs less than four events after the previous election in your previous virtue assembly. If you are in any doubt about your eligibility then you should consult the Tribune, or Merlot the civil service overseer of elections who can advise you.

The judgement to appoint a cardinal will typically close at 6pm on the Saturday of the summit. These times may differ if an unscheduled appointment is required but there are always at least three hours for nominations and three hours for voting. After that time, the candidate with the most support is declared cardinal.

The Cardinal of the Way serves until the next scheduled election for the title. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], or by the [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|virtue assembly]] of the Way.
