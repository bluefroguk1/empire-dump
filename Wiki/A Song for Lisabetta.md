Lyrics by Tiana i Zaydan i Riqueza 


The Flame that burns bright casts a long shadow
The journey you began, we are poised to follow
The flame that burns bright lasts for half as long
But the night is darkest before the dawn

What did you see when you looked in the mirror?
A Prince of great ambition? The Empire of your vision?
What did you see when you looked to the future?
To make the hard decisions, despite your opposition?

They say you hid how much you cared behind a mask
Lest your love be mistook for weakness
But the world would bend before you gave up on your task
May Holbergâ€™s pride forever serve as witness

You saw the beauty and the colour of the world
The great artistic renaissance your passion
But your smile gave me courage when I forgot the words
May even your dissenters mourn your passing

What did you see when you looked in the mirror?
The fire hid behind the mask of dignity?
What did you see when you looked to the future?
A world where all people lived at liberty
