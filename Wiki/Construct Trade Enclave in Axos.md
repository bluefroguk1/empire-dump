__NOTOC__
Raise a motion to construct a trade enclave in Axos to trade with Skoura in minor materials. This would create the imperial title ‘Merchant to Skoura’ to oversee the enclave. Appointed by the senators of Urizen. The enclave functions as a ministry. No upkeep is required. No senate or civilian commission will be required—constructed in Axos by Axou. Self-funded. This is the first opportunity to engage with Skoura, who have no direct border with the Empire.
''Proposed by Morrow, seconded by Reikos.''
## Outcome
* Construct a trade enclave in [[Axos]] to establish trade with [[Skoura]]
* Passed (but see below under Campaign Outcome)

## Date
* Autumn 383YE
## Cost
* Non-standard costs apply
* 12 wains of mithril
* 24 crowns in labour costs
## Progress

## Campaign Outcome
* Once completed this commission will be overseen by the title [[Merchant to Skoura]].
* This commission has not been successful. The Axou were under the impression the Empire would arrange this commission and be responsible for building this trading enclave - they have not set any resources aside to oversee the construction.
* As there appears to have been a misunderstanding, the civil service intends to present an [[Senate_motion#Administrative_Motions|administrative motion]] at the beginning of the Winter Solstice clarifying if the Senate wishes to go ahead with the enclave. If they do, then it will count against the commissions available during that season but will not require another [[Senate motion]].
*The Imperial Senate voted to go ahead with the construction during the first senate session of the Winter Solstice 383YE.

## Constitution
The Constitutional Court note that the civil service identified that the [[New_Imperial_titles#Well_Worn_Paths|well worn path]] for appointing this trade [[ministry]] was appointment through the [[Imperial Bourse]]. They have not struck the appointment by [[Senator|senators]] down as unconstitutional, but are setting time aside to review the principle of senatorial appointment especially as it related to ministries.
