I Come and Stand at Every Door Original lyrics by Nazim Hikmet
---------------


I come and stand at every door
But no one hears my silent tread
I knock and yet remain unseen
For I am dead, for I am dead.

I'm only seven although I died
In ancient cities long ago
I'm seven now as I was then
When children die they do not grow.

The last I saw was fell Vallorn
My eyes grew dim, my eyes grew blind
Death came and turned my bones to dust
And that was scattered by the wind.

I need no sleep, I need no breath
I need no fruit, nor even bread
I ask for nothing for myself
For I am dead, for I am dead.

All that I ask is that for peace
You fight today, you fight today
So that the children of this world
May live and grow and laugh and play.
