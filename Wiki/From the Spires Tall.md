March out bravely,
From the Spires tall,
Armour shod, sure of foot,
Warriors all,

The Empire calls us now,
Out we march to war,
Poise in ev’ry movement made,
A silent roar.

Heed the general’s shout,
Move at his command,
Shield and rod, wand and staff,
Sword at hand.

Strike our foes down,
Move and hold the line,
Weapons swift, eyes aflame,
Banners high.

March then* home again,
To the Spires tall,
Armour shod, victorious,
Warriors all.

 *Can be sung as “now” if on the return
