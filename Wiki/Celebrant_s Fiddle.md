## Description
A Celebrant's Fiddle allows a priest to use a musical performance to draw on the power of the [[Auras of Prosperity#Consecration|consecration]] of [[Prosperity]] to encourage their audience. Listeners are filled with a profound sense of satisfaction for what they have achieved with their hard work. The power of the magical musical instrument itself is only part of the process that brings about this spiritual experience - the performance itself helps connect the spirit of the audience with the power of the potent consecrated aura. 

These items may be any type of musical instrument, but they are often crafted as fiddles or other stringed instruments. While it might be expected that a musical instrument connected with Prosperity would appear expensive, this is actually relatively uncommon. Priests who favour this instrument, especially in [[the Marches]] or among [[sutannir]], prefer a durable instrument that can be used to play quick, lively music. The Celebrant's Fiddle is often quite effective at connecting to the celebratory impulse in the audience, dragging them onto the dance floor or helping them relax and enjoy the rewards their hard work have brought them.

Whereas priests who use many of the other musical instruments often intersperse their performances with readings or homilies, priests who favour the Celebrant's Fiddle generally allow their music to speak for itself. They favour uplifting, upbeat music that moves the body as well as the spirit - ceremonial use of this musical instrument is often indistinguishable from a festive celebration.

As with many religious [[magic items]], it is common for a Celebrant's Fiddle to be [[hallow|hallowed]]. An extremely popular choice is the [[Auras of Prosperity#Hallowing of the Overflowing Cup|Hallowing of the Overflowing Cup]], although the [[Auras of Prosperity#Hallowing of the Grateful Debtor|Hallowing of the Grateful Debtor]] is also reasonably common.

In [[Wintermark]], [[Prosperity]] is represented by [[Pallas]], and the [[Runes|Rune]] of Wealth is often worked into the decoration of the instrument.
