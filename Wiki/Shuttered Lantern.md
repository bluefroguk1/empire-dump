## Motto
''All knowledge is power.''

## The Manifesto
The Order of the Shuttered Lantern holds the following to be true:

* Magic is capable of both protecting, and exposing, secrets and knowledge.
* Acquiring the knowledge and secrets of the Empire's enemies strengthens us.
* Guarding and shielding the secrets of the Empire protects us.

The Order of the Shuttered Lantern therefore exists to:

* Utilise magic in the detection and monitoring of threats, whether subtle or obvious, internal or external
* Support the acquisition of the secrets and knowledge of hostile forces in all ways, from scrying to espionage
* Stave off blind fear, and allay the concerns of citizens, by addressing threats and hazards with discretion

## Symbol
The Order has been known to use the symbol of a black lantern, or the rune [[Diras]] picked out in grey on a darker or lighter grey background, or both together.

## Membership of the Order
Although the Shuttered Lantern's manifesto presents itself as acting discreetly so as not to cause undue concern to the citizens of the Empire, this inclination toward secrecy has occasionally been a two-edged sword. There are many rumours that the order has been engaged in shadowy warfare with sinister cults, cabals and secret societies. The order as a whole dismiss such notions as fanciful storytelling, pointing out that resourcing strategically applied scrying of hostile powers forms the core of their work and is far less glamorous.

It is an open secret that the Shuttered Lantern regularly employ curses against those they consider to be a threat to the Empire, whether Imperial citizen, barbarian or foreigner. The Order often supports magicians from other orders subject to a [[Declaration#Declaration of Sorcery|declaration of sorcery]] occasioned by an unpopular curse. As a result many magicians assume that the accused placed the curse at the behest of the order. Their true intentions are often hard to discern, as the Order habitually conceals their true agenda.

It is claimed that the order engages in espionage using mundane means as well as magical ones, though they usually refuse to reveal how they have come by their information. They consider it good sense to keep an eye not only on known enemies, but also on friends and allies - especially those who are close enough to harm the Empire. The first grandmaster, the [[Navarr]] [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|vate]] Damien Cloaked-in-Green famously said "''We are given two hands so that one might watch the other while it works."''

The order has a reputation for being paranoid, even among themselves, and members tend to work only with those they personally trust. These agents use the order as a way to maintain influence in the Conclave; to gain the magical resources they need to scry and uncover the plots of the enemies of the Empire; and to keep an eye on their fellow magicians. 

The order is very popular with [[Suaq]], [[Navarr]] and [[Highguard|Highborn]] magicians, and magician-priests of [[Vigilance]]. The order naturally tends to promote magic that revolves around either scrying or concealment. They have regularly been accused of underhand tactics, with claims of coercion and blackmail by several prominent members of the Conclave in the past.

They occasionally find themselves strange allies of the [[Unfettered Mind]] because both orders oppose needless regulation on Imperial magicians - although it must be said that the Shuttered Lantern are more interested in opposing unnecessary control of ''their'' magical behaviour, rather than the general magical behaviour of all wizards.

## Conclave vault
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Shuttered Lantern garners a pro rata share of the [[Conclave_vault#Crystal_Mana|Font]] based on the [[Imperial Conclave#Principle of Precedence|precedence]] of the orders at the previous summit; a portion of [[ilium]] based on their [[Conclave_vault#Ilium|position]] among the orders as determined by precedence; and additional materials due to outstanding bequests.
*Three ingots of [[weltsilver]] were pledged from the vale of Plovdiv in [[Karov]] in 201YE. These ingots are still being delivered despite reports that local veins having run dry. There is some speculation that the ingots in fact come from somewhere other than the inhabitants of the vale itself.
*Three ingots of [[tempest jade]] come from the [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[chapter]] of Jessica's Stand for a combination of information offered and rituals performed during the reign of [[Emperor Frederick]].
