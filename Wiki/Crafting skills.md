## Artisan
*4-point skill
*You must purchase this skill before you can take any other crafting skills

During the downtime between events, you may craft up to three [[magical items]] using rare [[materials]] that you have in your possession. The materials are used up to create the item. You may only craft items that you know how to make. Every artificer can also make, and apply, [[Artisan's Oil]], a special preparation that can mend broken items.

Rare materials are produced by mines and forests, which are [[Resource#Personal Resource|personal resources]].

You may also bond any item that you can make to a willing person. A character can only use a magical item if it is bonded to the wielder.

When you choose this skill you can pick four magical items that your character is able to create. The choices you can make are limited as described below. The character creation system is set up to enforce these restrictions automatically.

### Apprentice Item
The item you choose for your first slot must require no special materials to make. All these items take two months of downtime, rather than needing any special materials. If you take the artisan skill at character creation you will receive one of these items at the first event your character attends, with three events to run before it expires. You can expand the table below to see a list of items you can choose as your apprentice item.


### Journeyman Item
The item you choose for your second slot must require a maximum total of ten special materials to make. All items that need special materials to make require one month of downtime to forge. If you take the artisan skill at character creation you will receive one of these items at the first event your character attends, with two events to run before it expires. You can expand the table below to see a list of items you can choose as your journeyman item.

### Adept Item
The item you choose for your third slot must require a maximum total of twenty special materials to make. If you take the artisan skill at character creation you will receive one of these items at the first event your character attends, with one event to run before it expires. You can expand the table below to see a list of items you can choose as your adept item.


### Masterwork Item
The item you choose for your fourth slot and for any extra item skills you buy can be any item listed on the wiki. You will not receive one of the items for free at your first event. You can expand the table below to see a list of all the items available for your masterwork item.


## Extra Item
*1-point skill
*The cost of this skill is the same each time
You may choose one additional item that your character knows how to make each time you purchase this skill. There are no restrictions on what this item can cost.
