__NOTOC__
To repair and rebuild the Heliopticon in Urizen.''Proposed by Redoubt, seconded by Astolat.''
## Overview
* Commission to repair the central heliopticon towers in Morrow and Spiral in line with [[Fight_or_flight#A_New_Hope|recent proposals]].
* Passed at 27 Thrones and 2 Crowns.

## Date
* Winter 382YE
## Cost
* This commission uses [[Fight_or_flight#A_New_Hope|non-standard costs]].
* 12 wains of Mithril
* 24 Crowns
* Takes three months to complete.
*  This project will add additional costs to each Urizen territory, and require the usual upkeep of a college of magic (at the moment 25 Thrones).
## Progress
* 2 wains of mithril and 24 crowns provided by Andronikos after the Winter Solstice 382YE.
* 10 wains of mithril provided by Edmundo of Damakhan's Forge after the Winter Solstice 382YE.

## Campaign Outcome
* 27 Thrones and 2 Crowns disbursed to Senator for Redoubt.
* When complete, creates a unique Imperial title [[Doyen of the Spires]], appointed by majority decision of the magicians of Urizen. Title is held for as long as it takes them to codify a single arcane projection. They will be able to be revoked by the Imperial Synod.
* The magicians of Urizen will function like a college of magic, but the speed of research will depend on how many territories are part of the Urizen nation and connected to the Heliopticon network.
