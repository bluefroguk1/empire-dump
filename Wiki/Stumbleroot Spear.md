## Description
The dark wood haft of this spear must be supple and flexible, while maintaining its strength. An artisan carefully chooses the wood and treats it throughout the crafting process with ambergelt dissolved in pure alcohol, reinforcing the whole with green iron to maintain its responsiveness in the hands of a skilled warrior. In combat, the spear twists and turns, seemingly under its own power, and when properly guided will trip or unbalance an enemy, sending them sprawling. 

Some stories claim that the more blood the Stumbleroot Spear spills, the more malicious it becomes. They suggest that the spear begins to take on a mind of its own, seeking to trip or injure opponents without the intent of the wielder. They rarely speak of these worries unless deep in their cups. There is a tradition among some [[Navarr military concerns|thorns]] of burning the spear after a year to ensure it does not turn on its wielder. Some Imperial Orcs have adopted the same tradition, which meshes with their own beliefs about [[worth]] and the ways objects may be influenced by the uses they are put to.
