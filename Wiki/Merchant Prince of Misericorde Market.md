## Misericorde Market
During Summer 383YE it became clear that the Sand Fishers did not like entering Holberg. They find the crowded streets intimidating, they complain that it smells, and they find it difficult to understand all the rules the burghers insist are important. To ensure more effective cooperation and trade the Empire constructed a a covered market on the edge of the city as a place where business owners could come to sell their goods to the Sand Fishers and vice versa.

The market improves the supply of valuable herbs to the city of Holberg, and gives the Sand Fishers a place to buy useful finished goods, particularly metal goods like arrow points, knifes and spear tips. At present relations with the Sand Fishers are technically the responsibility of the Imperial Consul as they are classed as foreigners. Since the title has a suitably impressive sounding name, the Merchant Prince of Misericorde Market, it is likely that the Sand Fishers will look to them as a natural liaison - and bring any issues or problems they have to them first to try and get a resolution.
