All the Ushka mother
Born of land and shadow
Clustered in our wilderness
Prey for wolves and snow

All the Ushka father
Alive in wilderness
Holding fast against the cold
Surrounded by the darkness

All the Ushka sister
Hiding from the Vard
Bargains failed, fighting too
Then conquered heads are bowed

All the Ushka brother
Shared their hard won hearth
Rather than destruction
Protection offered worth

All the Ushka wise ones
Work hard and keep the faith
Bargainers refused to bow
Were exiled to the waste

All the Ushka children
From shadow 'neath the trees
Joined together, now are one
Varushka, we are free
