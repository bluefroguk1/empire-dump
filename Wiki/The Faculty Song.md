Lyrics by Jamie Wakefield and [[The Academy]] students.


Chorus
When we learn, we're wiser.
When we learn, we're braver.
When we learn, we're vigilant too.

When we learn, we're ambitious.
When we learn, we're prosperous.
When we learn, we're loyal and proud too.

Verse 1
This is our Academy,
We are taught by the faculty.
With Mr Harrow, who teaches us field craft.

Sasha is the secretary,
Spiritual studies are run by Emme,
And the Chancellor does magic with his hat.

Chorus

Verse 2
This is our Academy.
It is where we learn P.E., 
With Mr Scrib who shouts at us a lot.

Hopkirk teaches Alchemy.
Crafting items with the Dean.
For field trips go with Mr Everwatch.

Chorus
