__NOTOC__
The senate proposes to divert all Civil Service resources from historical research to prognostication. Instead of funding civil servants to conduct investigations and field work that risk putting them in harmâ€™s way, they will be tasked to do all they can to identify Sentinel Gate conjunctions aligned with areas of interest defined by the senate, or other suitably appointed bodies. 
Proposed by Sarvos, Seconded by Tassato.
