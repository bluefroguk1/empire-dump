Original: Least Of My Kind by Three Weird Sisters, found [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgCdDkmh5bo here], adapted by by Katherine Faber.
A pdf of the words and music can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/d/db/Least_of_My_Kind.pdf here].


Covered in dirt and mud, aching and spitting blood
Cursing, you start to rise and groan.
Far off through field and fell mutters the Chapter bell:
Never a Guardian falls alone

Chorus:

Think on the battle’s cost; this time the Lancer lost
Beaten and broken and blind.
Better beware one more, better prepare for war:
I was the least of my kind.

Prying my arrows cold out of my fingers’ hold
Pause to take stock, reflect and rue;
Look on the damage done here by a single one
What do you think a whole Lance will do?

Chorus

Bury me where I fall, far from the Chapter’s Call;
Slain in a fight I could not win;
Nearby, Unconquered hear, heads turn with pricking ears
Thought you, you fool, that I had no kin?

Chorus x2
