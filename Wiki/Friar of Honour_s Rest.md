Let this Sinecure stand as a reminder that the Empire makes mistakes and should acknowledge them.
## Overview
The [[Imperial Senate]] [[commission|commissioned]] the  [[Construct_Honour's_Rest|construction]] of Honour's Rest during the Autumn Equinox 381YE. Built in the [[Mournwold#The_ruins_of_Overton|ruins of Overton]] in [[Mournwold]], it was funded by the people of [[Wintermark]] and given as gift to the people of [[the Marches]]. The Friar of Honour's Rest is an [[Imperial title]] charged with looking after and preserving the shrine which stands as a memorial to those who fell in the battle to liberate the Mournwold. The position comes with custodianship of a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but awarded a regular income of [[liao]] and votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] to reflect the many pilgrims who come to Honour's Rest to meditate on the lessons of the battle for the Mourn.
## Responsibilities
The  Friar of Honour's Rest is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of those who traverse the [[Mournwold#Greensward|Greensward]] to visit the ruins of Overton. 

## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides eight measures of [[liao]] to the Friar each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in the Synod
The Friar of Honour's Rest may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 16 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 16 votes if they already have a [[congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly for which [[Sinecure#Synod_Votes|they are eligible]]. 
## Appointment
The Friar of Honour's Rest is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[judgement]] of the Marcher [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|Assembly]]. . 

The title can be held by any Marcher citizen. The Friar has [[tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Marcher National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Honour's Rest
The church of Honour's Rest stands atop a low hill near Overton on the Greensward. Built mostly in the Marcher style, there are a few clear Wintermark touches including a series of stone Winterfolk warriors that seem to watch over pilgrims and resident priests alike from the white-stone walls of the church. 

From the hill, it is only a short walk to the ruins, and pilgrims rest here on their way to visit the great barrow mounds raised by the [[Jotun]] in the wake of the fall of Orchard's Watch. Occasionally, the friars who live and work here are called on to address problems with angry or mournful ghosts that haunt the ruins, but for the most part Honour's Rest is an oasis of quiet, calm, and sorrow.
