## Overview
The Imperial Seer is an [[Imperial title]] [[Create_title_of_Imperial_Seer|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Autumn Equinox 379YE. It is appointed through the [[Imperial Conclave]]. They are responsible for coordinating the use of divination magic by the magicians of the Empire. The title was [[384YE_Winter_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Amend_Imperial_Seer|amended by the Senate]] during the Winter Solstice 384YE to grant it a stipend from the Imperial treasury.
## Responsibilities
The Seer is responsible for coordinating the use of divination magic by Imperial magicians. While this most obviously involves ensuring that the Empire is making the best use of rituals such as [[Eyes of the Sun and Moon]], [[The Eye of the High Places]], and [[Dreams in the Witch House]], the title has potentially broader implications. "Divination magic" would also cover the use of rituals such as the potentially valuable visions provided by [[Signs and Portents]], [[Whispering Shadow Courtiers]], or the consumption of [[Infusions_of_Feathers#Goosewhisper_Infusion|Goosewhisper Infusion]]. It might also cover gathering historical information of note through [[Skein of Years]], communion with eternals through powers such as [[Swim Leviathan's Depth]] or [[Clear Counsel of the Everflowing River]], and the coordination of magicians who work with the [[magistrates]] and [[Officers_of_the_Law#The_Imperial_Militia|Imperial militia]] to uncover information vital to law enforcement.
## Powers
### Address the Senate
The Imperial Seer has the right to make an address to the Senate once per summit. This allows them to present important information for the Senators consideration. To use this power, the Seer informs the Civil Service that they wish to address the Senate. Their address will be added to the agenda for the next [[Senate session]].
### Address the Council
The Imperial Seer has the right to make an [[Council address|address]] to the [[Imperial Military Council]] once per summit. To use this power, the Seer informs the [[Herald of the Council]] that they wish to make an address, which will then be added to the agenda for the next [[Council session]].

### Custodian of ''The Hawk's Demeanour''
Following the appearance of a [[Darkest night|powerful magical shroud]] covering the entire Empire in Winter 380YE, an obscure [[bands#Covens|coven]] based in [[Kallavesa#Wittal_Grove|Wittal Grove]] known as the Augurs of the Opalescent Gloaming presented the Imperial Seer with a unique magical [[:Category:Foci|ritual mask]] called the ''The Hawk's Demeanour''. This [[Magic_items#Artefacts|artefactual]] [[Strigine Mask]] is possessed of an additional power that allows the [[create bond|bonded]] wearer to employ [[materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]] in place of crystal mana when performing [[Eyes of the Sun and Moon]] or [[Eye of the High Places]]. The mask is legally part of the regalia of the Imperial Seer. When the Imperial title changes hands the item should be given to the new Imperial Seer with all appropriate haste.

### Waters of the Shimmering Shore
The Augurs of the Opalescent Gloaming have also committed to providing the Imperial Seer with two doses of a magical liquid they call "Waters of the Shimmering Shore" each season. This translucent magical substance can empower a divination ritual to penetrate the power of magical shrouds (although interestingly not to rituals such as [[Piercing Light of Revelation]] that do not by their nature gather information). Details of its provenance are not common knowledge, but it is believed to be drawn from the Day realm, possibly as a consequence of an agreement with an [[eternal]].

### Stipend
The Imperial Seer receives a stipend of 40 thrones each season from the [[Imperial treasury]]

## Appointment
The appointment, replacement, or removal of the Imperial Seer is made by the [[Candidacy|Declaration of Candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. The Seer serves until they are replaced by another magician using the Declaration of Candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]].
