The results are cumulative, so if 15 military units in total are assigned then the players receive all the benefits listed on the table.

A copy of the information gained is provided to every player who assigned a military unit to the spy network, along with the the normal resources they would receive if they were supporting an army instead. 

Upgraded military units are proportionally more effective. Each upgrade a military unit has adds the equivalent of 1/5 of an extra unit to the overall tally.
