Give me a dagger, a coinpurse and a smile, and nothing is impossible
## Overview
Mountebanks are a combination of confidence trickster and streetwise magician found in [[The League]]. Part con-artist, part street entertainer, mountebanks are street-mages with a (sometimes ill-deserved) reputation as thieves and scoundrels. Mountebanks rely on their wits, often engaging in complex scams and long-term cons against the richest and most powerful members of society. A group of mountebanks combines magical lore with a variety of other skills, doing whatever works to complete their goals. Unlike many ritual groups, mountebanks often experiment with improvisation rather than relying purely on formulaic rituals, tailoring their magic to the specific situation they are in. This is expensive in terms of resources and talent, but can be very rewarding.

Not all mountebanks belong to groups. A street-mage like this may be working alone for a variety of reasons, some of which they will be unlikely to share. They may just prefer the freedom of working as and when they please, or they may be avoiding the telling of a dark secret or escaping a dark past. For whatever reason, these magicians work hand-to-mouth and alone, or very occasionally with another, though the nature of these partnerships is  transient - more often a mountebank will team up with somebody with skill at arms, or another skill that they do not share.

Some mountebank [[Groups#Covens|covens]] practice a form of [[dramaturgy]] that involves improvised, comedic or slapstick performances to mask their use of ritual magic. This practice is frowned on by the [[troupe]] magicians of the league ... which simply makes it all the more appealing to the mountebanks.
