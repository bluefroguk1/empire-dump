## Description
This rod stores and enhances the power of magic intended to drive an opponent away. It can be used to great effect to break up an enemy formation, or to give a magician a temporary respite when faced by multiple opponents. This rod is regarded as a weapon for the serious battle-magician, one who has studied the magics of war and wishes to extend their abilities. [[The League|League]] [[bravo]]s with a taste for magic are fond of the 'Gyres for throwing people across taverns during bar brawls in flamboyant fashion in addition to its potent tactical advantage on the battlefield.

In [[Wintermark]], these rods sometimes have a slightly hammer-like form and are a weapon of choice among the [[Wintermark magical traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]] who take to the field of battle, as its powerful blows resembles the swinging of the hammer in the forge. Their students among the [[Imperial Orcs]], the [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#warcasters|Warcasters]], also appreciated the rod's power, but the Orcs also found the name extremely pleasing. Being able to spell ''Tumultuous Gyre'' correctly is seen as testament to the owner's [[Imperial_Orcs_culture_and_customs#Writing|literacy]] and the owners of such rods sometimes inscribe the name on the rod itself.

Highguard battle-casters call these rods ''Horseshoes' Mark'', recalling the powerful kicks delivered by trained [[horse|warhorses]], which at their greatest could be more deadly than the [[Highguard military concerns|cataphracts]] they carried. A rare few examples have antique horse shoes built into them.


## Rules

* Effect: Twice per day you can cast the [[repel]] spell as if you knew it and without spending any mana.
* Materials: Crafting a Tumultuous Gyre requires six ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]] and three measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.


“G... Y... R...” the young orc painted the letters down the length of his new rod with painstaking precision, one in each gap between the dragonbone coils along its length. He looked up at Dunstan Anjing with a hopeful look in his eyes, grinning broadly as he did. The runesmith was always a bit surprised at the bright enthusiasm that shone out of Tik’s young eyes; he was so much bigger than any human boy his age, but just as innocent.

Dunstan did not wear the look that Tik had hoped for, however, but a look that he had learned (through much experience) meant, “...anything else?”

“Er... oh, clotpole it, it’s an E, isn’t it?”

“Language, Tik. But it is, yes.”

The young orc bit his lip as he stared out of the window. “When’s the Legion going to be back, Dunstan?” he said plaintively. “I miss the Legion.”

Dunstan sighed and gripped the boy’s shoulder firmly. He’d known apprentices get homesick before – of course he had – but never like this. When he’d agreed to take the boy in and teach him the runesmith’s trade, he’d never expected that he would spend almost as much time missing the company of other orcs as he would shaping and carving. “The Legion will be back when it’s done patrolling, boy,” he said, “And with any luck, it’ll have a good tale to tell for it. Much worth earned, and all that.” 

“I can’t wait to get into the ranks,” he said, “I’ll never be away from them again. I’ll stand between the warriors and wait for just the right moment, and then I’ll send the barbarians flying! They’ll never know what hit them! You’ve gotta... you’ve gotta always have the element of surprise, that’s what Gannik says.”

“Gannik’s got a point, boy. I’ve seen these rods scatter the best of an enemy, so your mates only have to deal with what’s left. One spell, two targets – there’s not many around who can boast that kind of power, you know? Once word of that sort of thing gets round, ‘specially among the kind of primitives who’ve barely seen a magical wand before, the enemy starts to think you’ve got something really special in waiting. Of course, they have – they’ve got you!”

“That’s why I wanted to learn it,” Tik said, smiling at the compliment, “I’m going to be the best warcaster in the Legion, and scare all the barbarians away.”

The boy had ambition, that much was certain, and pride in his heritage. Vigilance and courage would come with age. But there were skills that came first. “I’m sure you’ll make a fine magician for your people, young lad, and remember to remember yourself to me next time you’re fighting up Hahnmark way. But not until you learn to spell, boy. So come on, hop to it.”

“Oh yeah. Gyre. Right. It needs an E, yeah?” Dunstan nodded. Tik grinned, “I know this one.”

He took his paintbrush in hand, dipped it in thinner, and began to erase the still-wet letters he'd just painted. “G... E... Y... R...” he said, his tongue sticking out of his mouth a little with the effort of thought.

Dunstan pinched his brow, and held out a hand to stop the boy before he got any further.
