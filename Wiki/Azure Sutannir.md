## Azure Chorus
A beautiful temple of white granite and marble flecked with deep blue veins, the Azure Chorus stands not far from Fort Braydon on the foothills of the Gilded Peak. Below the temple is a natural amphitheatre, augmented with carefully sculpted blocks of White Granite to produce a curved, acoustically vibrant performance space, surrounded by tiers of seating with long sweeping access points for ease of audience participation. Performers are encouraged to demonstrate their skills, the acoustics not only being superb for the singing but also encourage others to join in.
