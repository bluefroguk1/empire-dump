## Description
The Thorn's Mark is potentially deadly in the hands of both [[Kallavesi]] and [[Steinr]] warriors. The [[Magic_items#Schema|schema]] was purchased from the eternal [[Estavus]] as part of [[Inkpot_gods#The_Mediators_Bargain|her offer]] to the mediators of Wintermark. Originally known as the ''Eagles Talon'' the spear was renamed by the [[Steinr]] runesmith Derowen Voice of the Forge when she passed the schema to [[Wintermark_Egregore#Sulkavaris|Sulkavaris]] to be added to Runesmith's Law.

## Rules

* Effect: Twice per day you may call STRIKEDOWN with this one-handed spear.
* Materials: Crafting the Thorn's Mark requires twelve ingots of [[green iron]], eight measures of [[ambergelt]], seven ingots of [[tempest jade]],  and three ingots of [[orichalcum]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
