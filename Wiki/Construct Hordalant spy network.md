The creation of a spy network to explore the lands West of imperial Territories, to be based in Hordalant.Proposed by Therunin, seconded by Mitwold. 

### Overview
* Construct a [[spy network]] in the [[Jotun]]-controlled territory of [[Hordalant]].
* Hordalant is described in a recent piece of [[historical research]] concerning the reign of [[Emperor Guntherm]]. "''The Marchers headed down the southern coast of the Gullet, into Narkyst, and made a spirited attempt to capture the territory named Hordalant on the border of Bregasland; they successfully overran the marshes of Blutgahn and the plains of Ashahohn but were incapable of making further progress.''"

### Date
* Spring 379YE.

### Cost
* 10 [[Imperial_Bourse#Weirwood|weirwood]] ([[Spy network|Standard costs]])
* Time: 3 months to construct
* Upkeep: 2 Thrones per season from the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] budget

### Progress
* 10 wains of weirwood supplied by Caerwyn after Summer Solstice 379YE
* The spy network was completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 379YE

### Campaign Outcome
* Any Imperial citizen can assign a [[military unit]] they control to support the spy network.
** If the equivalent of five military units are assigned, then a map of the territory showing settlements will be shown.
** With ten military units, the location and nature of armies, naval routes and trading partners in the territory will be discovered. 
** With fifteen military units, the location and size of fortifications in the territory will be discovered.
* The results are cumulative, so if 15 military units in total are assigned then the players receive all the benefits listed on the table.
* Upgraded military units are proportionally more effective. Each upgrade a military unit has adds the equivalent of 1/5 of an extra unit to the overall tally. 
* Information will go to the players who assigned military units to the network.
* Military units assigned to a spy network also receive a share of the [[Military_unit#Downtime_Options|Imperial guerdon]] just as they would receive when supporting an [[Imperial army]].
