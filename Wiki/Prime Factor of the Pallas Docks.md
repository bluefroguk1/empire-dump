## Overview
Constructed [[Construct_Jarmish_Docks#Campaign_Outcome|by order]] of the [[Imperial Senate]], work was completed on this set of dedicated docks shortly before the Spring Equinox 381YE.

The Prime Factor of the Pallas Docks oversees a [[ministry]] that allows the purchase of [[weirwood]] from the [[Principalities of Jarm]].

## Responsibilities
The Prime Factor of the Pallas Docks is expected to ensure that the Magician-Prince of Pӓrnau Principality in Eastern Jarm continues to trade weirwood to the Empire. If the [[#Pallas Docks|Pallas Docks]] were ever directly threatened, the Prime Factor would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[opportunity]] related to the docks. The continued operation of the docks, and thus the ministry, requires that relations between the Empire and Jarm remain cordial - the Prime-factor has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

### Ministry


Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on the [[Principalities of Jarm]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE the cost of purchasing weirwood through the Pallas Docks increased by roughly a fifth. Following the [[384YE_Summer_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Amend_Liberty_Pact|amendment]] to the Liberty Pact and the [[Tariffs#Embargo|embargo]] placed on Jarm during the Summer Solstice 384YE it is no longer possible to purchase weirwood through the seat.

## Appointment
This title is auctioned during the Winter Solstice alongside the Imperial Bourse's [[Imperial_Bourse#Weirwood_Seats|weirwood seats]]. 

Any Imperial citizen can participate in the auction and hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
Regarding Pӓrnau Principality
This title has some additional restrictions. In the event relations with Jarm collapsed, the title would still exist but would not be able to purchase weirwood. If such a catastrophic breakdown were to happen, once it were resolved it might be necessary to renegotiate with the Magician-Prince of Pӓrnau Principality. 

Furthermore, the Jarmish have specified that the Prime Factor ''must'' be a [[magical skills#Magician|magician]]. They have no legal ability to enforce this, but discovering that the Prime Factor is not a magician would provide very good grounds for the Jarmish closing this trade route.

## Pallas Docks
These private docks are built in [[Redoubt#Cargo|Cargo]], not far from the [[Redoubt#The_Embassies_of_Cargo|Jarmish embassy]]. They were built with the aid of the [[Asavean Archipelago|Asavean]] architect [[Those_who_worship#Almodin_Okt.C3.ADstis.2C_Priest_of_the_Builder|Almodin Oktístis]] who was approached to design 'in keeping with [[Urizen|Urizeni]] style' by [[Senator]] [[Kallavesa]]. The original design included a number of statues and decorations referencing the false gods of the Asavean religion. Following the Spring Equinox 383YE, the docks were somewhat damaged by a mob of angry citizens riled up by the Imperial Synod. The statues and mosaics were torn out, smashed, and the remains repurposed as ballast for ships visiting Cargo. Fortunately, this coincided with a Senate plan to redesign the works of Almodin Oktístis. These events are covered in more detail [[383YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_fortune#Wrecking_Ball|here]].

Today, the Pallas Docks have changed only a little. They Still take the form of a number of long piers and jetties that extend the available space at the cargo docks, along with a series of dedicated cranes for lifting the wares to the town proper. Notable features include a series of lights mounted on towers at the ends of the piers to guide ships in made to look like miniature Urizeni Spires; and a gorgeous fresco in the main warehouse depicting Urizen mages in their spires watching the arrival of the first Highborn ships. 

Almost directly above the docks, in the town proper, is a small enclave for use by the visiting Parnau Principality merchants. It consists of two residential buildings, one of which includes a small office, and two large warehouses for storing the weirwood prior to its transfer to the civil service (who issue the Factor with bourse paperwork as normal).

The docks are for the exclusive use of merchants and traders dispatched by the Magician-Prince of Pӓrnau Principality (in Eastern Jarm), who bring regular shipments of incredibly valuable weirwood from the distant nation. Stories are already circulating of a deal secured between Lord-Magister Anton Trescher (the main advisor to the Jarmish Princes on trade and Imperial matters) and the [[Grendel]] to leave these ships and their valuable cargo alone - yet it must also be noted that the merchant vessels invariably arrive with an escort of sleek, Jarmish warships.
