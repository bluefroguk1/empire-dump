## Overview
The Steward of the Mines of Gulhule is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to an [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial Orc]] citizen. It is a national position appointed by majority vote of the Imperial Orc commanders of military units. The vote is organized by the [[Imperial Bourse]].

Orcs do not like to work in mines. It reminds them of the centuries they spent as slaves, and indeed the Steward has in the past specifically refused to allow any Imperial Orc citizens to work in the mines of Skarsind. Yet Gulhule is rich in precious metals and there is never any shortage of people willing to dig ore out of rock for a good day's pay. The Mines of Gulhule was created to allow the Imperial Orcs the chance to take advantage of that. The Steward, occasionally ''Foreman'', organises the effort to find and recruit miners prepared to make the trek north from their offices in Gulhule.

## Responsibilities
The Steward is expected to ensure that there are sufficient workers and miners employed to keep the many small mines fully operational. This keeps the valuable metals flowing down from the mountains to the rest of Skarsind and from there to the Empire. The close contact with mine owners allows ample opportunity for the Steward to acquire supplies of rare metals at bargain prices, and it is expected they will make those metals available to their fellows in the Imperial Orcs - at an appropriate profit, of course.

### Bounteous Skarsind
As a [[ministry]], the title of Steward of the Mines of Gulhule allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The Steward makes their decision how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Spring Equinox. The Steward is appointed by Imperial Orcs who control [[military unit]] [[Resource|personal resources]] who [[Military_unit#Supporting_an_Army|supported]] an [[Imperial army]] during the previous year. The larger the military unit an individual has, and the more often they supported the Imperial armies, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only an Imperial Orc character may hold this title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As an Imperial title appointed through the Bourse, they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
