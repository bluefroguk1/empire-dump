## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

 

### Effects

The target gains the ability to use [[Heroic skills#Unstoppable|unstoppable]] twice per day as if they know the skill, without spending any [[Heroic skills#Hero points|hero points]]. 

The target is also under a [[roleplaying effect]]: whenever a fight breaks out, you feel a strong urge to join in, and find the experience of fighting to be especially joyful and energizing.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 9. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description
When the drums pound and the horns are blown, those under this [[enchantment]] find it difficult to rein in their enthusiasm. Their hearts beat faster, and their limbs ache to be wielding their weapons. They can shrug off blows that would incapacitate a lesser warrior, even drawing on the fierce love of battle that the enchantment creates to drive them back to their feet, ready to fight again.

This ritual is occasionally used on battlefield healers, but there have been incidents where some of those healers were unable to resist the urge to get involved in the fighting, often with tragic consequences for themselves and their allies. 

## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves music, most commonly drumming. A common element involves synchronizing the beat of the drums to the heartbeat of the target, and then slowly accelerating as the ritual moves towards its climax.

The rune [[Jotra]] is often used with this ritual, and evocations of [[The Stallion]], of horses or bears, and especially of [[Legendary beasts#Gryphons|gryphons]] and [[legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]]..
