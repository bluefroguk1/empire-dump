## Escon
Escon is the Highborn [[egregores|egregore]], and has three primary interests: to embody the [[The_Way|Imperial faith]] and commitment to Virtue; to promote the [[Highguard_military_concerns|martial spirit]] of the Highborn; and to expand the knowledge of the nation. The spirit often encourages competition, but always as a way to promote and encourage Highborn pursuit of excellence and the virtue of [[Ambition]]. Escon often helps people make up their own minds and come to their own conclusions, through careful questioning and encouragement to examine motivations, actions, and beliefs. Most of all, Escon encourages the Highborn to embrace their [[Highguard_history|history]] and pursue Virtue with every part of their being. 

When the egregore spirit bonds with a citizen of Highguard, they traditionally preface their name "Escon, who was X". This reminds the Highborn that while they may look, and often act, the same as they did before they bonded, anyone who speaks to them is speaking with the spirit of the nation. As long as they are bonded, they are Escon first, and the person they were before, second.
## Current Hosts
### Micah, Child of Dinah, of Accolade's Fall
As Zenith fell to the Druj in spring 382YE, the armies of Highguard attempted to stem the Druj tide and allow the safe retreat of Urizeni refugees. Fighting with the Seventh Wave was Micah of Accoladeâ€™s Fall, an unconquered from a chapter based in Greatwood. Cut off as they tried to evacuate a refugee camp, and stranded behind enemy lines, Micah became host to Escon as they used all their skill and training to escape back to Imperial-held territory, arriving in Anvil in Summer 382YE.Escon who was Micah is in Anvil to inspire action and virtuous deeds amongst the Highborn and is keen to fight alongside the heroes of the Empire.
