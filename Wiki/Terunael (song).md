New Lyrics by Joanna VanderHoeven


O 'Terunael, you shine where you stand   [G Am C Am]
And the more I think on you the more I think long  [G Am C G]
If I had you now as I had once before  [Am Bm Gsus Am]
All the lords in the Empire could not save Terunael.  [Am Bm Gsus D]
 
O Ternuael, I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction of adorned city
For it stood in the forest for many's the long day
Till the days the Vallorn came and stole it away.
 
O Terunael, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before  
All the Lords in the Empire could not save Terunael.
 
All the birds in the forest they bitterly weep
Saying, "Where shall we shelter or where shall we sleep?"
For the Oak and the Ash, they are all now Vallorn
And the walls of Terunael are all down to the ground.
 
O Terunael, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the Lords of the Empire could not save Terunael.
