## Description
This spell is a potent malediction that can neutralise the most powerful enemy champion or render an [[archmage]] as powerless as a raw recruit.The debilitation imposed by this spell is more than mere lack of strength - it is a potentially lethal curse. The victim cannot concentrate on even the simplest [[spellcasting|spell]], cannot inspire themselves to [[Heroic skills|heroic action]] and cannot use the powers of any [[magic items]] they are bonded to.

It is particularly insidious in that it does not go away naturally; it can be removed with [[Bladeroot|herbs]] by a skilled [[Surgical skills#Physick|physick]], or purged by a magician using the [[purify]] spell or a [[rituals|ritual]] such as [[Renewed Strength of the New Day]]. Otherwise, it lasts indefinitely.

## Casting

## Effects
You may call [[Calls#WEAKNESS|WEAKNESS]] against the target struck by your [[Weapons & armour#Implements|implement]].

The weakness condition prevents the target from using any [[Heroic skills#heroic skills|heroic skills]], using any mana, or activating any [[enchantment|enchantments]] or [[magic items]] that are not "always on".

You must assume that the target has taken the effect.

The effect lasts until cured by the [[purify]] spell, or a similar potion or magic.

## Common Elements
* Rune Magic: The rune of Weakness, [[Kyrop]] is unsurprisingly invoked in conjunction with this invocation.
* Astronomancy: The [[The Drowned Man|Drowned Man]], the astronomantic constellation associated with endings and with curses, is commonly invoked with the weakness spell.
* Dramaturgy: A [[Dawn|Dawnish]] witch might echo the terrifying roar of the [[Legendary_beasts#Chimera|chimera]], or the dire spirit of the [[Legendary_beasts#Sphinxes and Manticores|manticore]] when casting this spell.
* Other traditions: This spell has a strong resonance for the realm of Winter.
