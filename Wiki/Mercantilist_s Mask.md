## Description
The Mercantilist's Mask provides the wearer with a greater understanding of the tides and rivers of wealth that flow through the Empire and beyond; they learn to better manipulate such forces to benefit business. It is rare for one of these masks not to incorporate a [[Wintermark]] rune - most often [[Pallas]] the Rune of Wealth. Some [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] make use of subtle [[Queros]] or serendipitous [[Ull]]. Outside Wintermark, the rune is often inscribed on the interior of the mask, often in such a way that it will rest just above the lips of the wearer.

These masks are seldom opulent or bejewelled, instead preferring a subtle touch of gold trim or silver inlay on a plain and well crafted base. Coins are an obvious motif to include when fashioning such an item; in [[the Brass Coast]] a popular form of this mask is a lower-face veil composed of two dozen ring coins bound together with [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] wires called (unsurprisingly) a ''Veil of Rings''. 

Fish are sometimes used - the scales of a fish can appear metallic, and they navigate literal tides in the same way the magician seeks to navigate metaphoric economic tides (as well as having obvious resonance with the [[Winds of Fortune]] ritual). In [[Varushka]] the mask may be engraved with [[Varushka_religious_beliefs#The Virtuous Animals|bees]], but a mask in the shape of a squirrel may also work well with the magic employed (the squirrel is wise, but it also collects and stores nuts in a way that has obvious resonance to the behaviour of a business owner).

As with all the magical masks, these [[:Category:Foci|foci]] are used to grant additional power to perform [[rituals|ritual]] magic. In this case, the Mercantilist's Mask empowers the [[Streams of Silver]], [[Rivers of Gold]], and [[Winds of Fortune]] rituals. All three rituals deal with the accumulation of wealth; subtly nudging synchronicity to ensure a steady flow of coins into the pockets of a [[business]] owner.

By itself, it will allow even a novice autumn ritualist to perform Streams of Silver without having mastered it and without the assistance of a coven. It is sufficient to empower that simple ritual enough to let a ritualist add one or two additional businesses to a performance depending on the mastery of the wearer. It is not quite so impactful when used to perform Rivers of Gold or Winds of Fortune - in theory, it might allow a master of Autumn magic who is familiar with the ritual to perform it by themselves (perhaps one who has access to an appropriate [[Unguents_of_Falling_Leaves#Bronze Spider Balm|potion]] or [[Melancholic_Staff|ritual staff]]). More likely it will help a [[bands#Coven|coven]] gather sufficient power to perform the ritual with limited mastery, or [[enchantment|enchant]] an [[Rivers_of_Gold#Additional_Targets|additional business]] or [[Winds of Fortune#Additional Targets|fleet]] that might otherwise be beyond their power with a single performance.

## Rules

* Effect: Gain 1 rank for the [[Streams of Silver]], [[Rivers of Gold]], and [[Winds of Fortune]] rituals, subject to the [[Realm_Lore#Gaining_additional_ranks|normal rules for effective skill]].
* Materials: Crafting a Mercantilist's Mask requires five ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], three measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], and three measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
