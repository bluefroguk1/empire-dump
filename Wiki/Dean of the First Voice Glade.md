It quickly became a gathering place for members for several [[striding|stridings]]. Splitroot Striding, The Twisted Tree Tradehouse, and Splinterspear funded and built a small school at the location to ensure that Gerallt continued to provide a lasting legacy for future generations. The music school trains its students in classical Navarr musical traditions, as well as other performing arts skills such as dancing, juggling, fire performance etc etc. The school is strictly focused on Navarr traditions.

Courses range in duration and intensity from the prestigious three year musical degree, to weekend-long workshops for passing stridings.
