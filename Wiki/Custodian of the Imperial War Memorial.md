## Overview
The Custodian is an [[Imperial title]] in the [[Imperial Synod|Synod]]. It grants custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. The position was [[Construct memorial at Anvil |established]] by a motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Summer Solstice 378YE. Following some confusion, the appointment method of the title was [[Amend_title_of_Custodian_of_the_Imperial_War_Memorial|clarified]] by the Imperial Senate in Summer Solstice 381YE.

## Responsibilities
The Custodian of the Imperial War Memorial is responsible for ensuring the good maintenance of the war memorial itself. Traditionally, individuals who look after such monuments are called on to speak on behalf of the dead especially during memorial services.

## Powers

### Point of Pilgrimage
The Custodian receives 6 [[liao]] and 12 votes in the Imperial Synod. If the custodian is not a priest, these votes could be used in the General Assembly. If the custodian is a priest, they can call on these votes in any assembly they already participate in.
## Appointment
The Custodian is a [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[appointment]] made by a [[judgement]] of the Highguard [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]]. This is a national title and can only be held by a Highborn citizen.

As with most sinecures, this appointment has [[tenure]]. The assumption is that the Custodian retains the position until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by a lesser majority of the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Assembly of the Nine, or by the Highborn National Assembly.
