## Description
An Icon of the Righteous allows a priest to perform [[Religious skills|ceremonies]] as if they were [[dedication|dedicated]] to the virtue of [[Courage]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a [[Paragons_and_Exemplars|paragon or exemplar]] of Courage such as [[Inga Tarn]] or [[Isaella]]. The Icon is not always a portrait - in [[Wintermark]] it is often crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the feathers and bones of jackdaws, painted with the [[Jotra|Rune of Battle]], and called either a ''Jackdaw Icon'' or a ''Thunderhead Blade''. In [[Varushka]], it is commonly crafted as a statue called variously a ''Brave Bear'' or a ''Courageous Boar.'' In some parts of [[the Marches]], the Varushkan style of Icon has proved surprisingly popular - a statuette of a boar called a ''Brave Pig'' is used by many friars. 

The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to [[Religious_skills#Performing_a_Ceremony|perform]] ceremonies such as [[anointing]], [[consecration]], and [[hallow]], and create [[aura|auras]] of Courage in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to [[Religious_skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with priests dedicated to Courage who are not part of their [[Bands#Sects|sect]].
