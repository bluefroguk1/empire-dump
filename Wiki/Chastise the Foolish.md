## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 At the end of the ritual one of the [[Rituals#Contributors|contributors]] is chosen to deliver the curse with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]].



### Effects
This ritual creates a [[curse]] that is delivered to a target with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]]: one [[Rituals#Contributors|contributor]] is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 

While under the effect of the curse, the character cannot make use of [[liao]]; they can't use or contribute to the performance of any [[Religious skills|Religious skill]]. This applies even if the character is using an ability or item that allows them to use religious skills without actually using any liao (such as the power of a [[Mendicant Cassock]]).

They also experience a [[roleplaying effect]]; you are assailed by doubt, especially as regards your strongest held convictions, and beliefs. The stronger you believe something to be true, the stronger the doubts become. Occasionally, you may hear a barely audible voice whispering in your ear, telling you that everything you believe is flawed and nothing more than fantasy. You may also occasionally glimpse of a gaunt, hateful spirit lurking nearby reflected in mirrors.



### Removing the Curse
The curse can be alleviated by an powerful [[exorcism]] as if it were a spirit with a strength of 20.
