## Description
This [[enchantment]] is one of the best-known Summer rituals and is used to bolster bands of warriors across the Empire. When dealing with small groups, [[Strength of the Bull]] is a little more efficient, but ''Splendid Panoply of Knighthood'' is more effective at enchanting a band of soldiers. Indeed, the more soldiers that are part of a single enchantment, the more efficient it becomes. The rituals are otherwise quite similar, although the fact that the ''Splendid Panoply'' is invariably used on a band rather than an individual means that its performances are usually a much larger-scale affair. It is often performed shortly before battle, often a within an hour or so of dawn.

The ability to use [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] to provide power to the ritual - something which is not possible with Strength of the Bull - also makes it appealing to magicians whose access to crystal mana is more restricted than their access to raw orichalcum.

## Common Elements
As with many [[enchantment]] rituals, common elements include the consumption of wholesome food and drink (especially mead or beer) and the use of tokens and gifts such as [[Dawn hearth magic#Favours|favours]].  Oaths, toasts and rousing speeches are also common, as are choruses of songs favoured by soldiers. The ritual often focuses on rousing the fighting spirit of the targets, and the invocation of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Courage]] and [[Loyalty]] are especially common.

Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Summer runes]] might be evoked, depending entirely on the nature of the warriors and the ritualists. Runes are often painted onto the skin especially the face and arms. Navarr [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|vates]] and [[Wintermark]] [[Wintermark magical traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]] alike will trace the scars, brands and tattoos of their targets as they perform the ritual, connecting the strength gained today with oaths or wounds from the past. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of horses, bulls, narwhal, [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]] and [[Legendary beasts#Dragons, Wyverns and Wyrms|dragons]].

The [[Captain's Mask]] is a [[:Category:Foci|ritual focus]] that helps empower the performance of this ritual.
