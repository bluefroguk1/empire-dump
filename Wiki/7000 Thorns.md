7000 Thorns
By Idwyn Splitroot

Drum beat “Kill the Jotun”
Liathaven (repeated throughout)

Call of Winter Magic, The Dead will rise
Slaughtering the Jotun, a voiceless demise

We will fight (No mercy)
Through the night (No mercy)
We will fight (No mercy)
Through the night

7000 Thorns of the Navarr
Rip through the night
Leave no scars
Leave your blood or leave no mark
We are the reason
You fear the dark

Liathaven x2 (and throughout)
Poorly guarded steading
The trap was laid
Slaughtering the Joutn
Be afraid
