## Overview
The Guardian of the Cairn is an [[Imperial title]] [[Construct Sylvihrafn Crystal Henge|established]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during Autumn 378YE. The stones and cairns that make up the crystal henge are quite old, but their use as a source of crystal mana is very recent. Construction and expansion began in late-autumn 378YE and was finished just in time for the Winter Solstice. The stones themselves were augmented with polished mithril, and several cairns were adjusted to help direct flows of subterranean mana toward them. 

The position of Guardian is a sinecure, requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 

## Responsibilities
The Guardian has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Game_items#Mana_Crystals|crystal mana]] from the Sylvihrafn in [[Skarsind]]. If the Henge were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Guardian to deal with those threats.

## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Guardian of the Cairn gains custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. The Guardian receives an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
## Appointment
The Guardian of the Cairn is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Wintermark]] [[senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.

The title can be held by a Wintermark citizen. The Guardian has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wintermark [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Sylvihrafn
The crystal henge of Sylvihrafn stands in [[Skarsind]] near the Hold of Hrafnar in the north-eastern [[Skarsind#Skogei Glens|Skogei Glens]]. The hall and the henge alike overlook the dark forests of [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Miekarova]]. It is named for the late Sylvi Hrafn who fell during the [[Sermersuaq#Recent_History|Battle of Ikka's Tears]]; her body joins that of her ancestors among the cairns. The newly expanded circle was originally named the Sylvi Hrafn Crystal Henge, but as is the way in Wintermark the name was quickly shortened to Sylvihrafn.

The henge itself is reasonably old; the founders of the Hold of Hrafnar often performed magical rituals here. When the [[Thule]] barbarians conquered the Skogei Glens, they continued this practice themselves - there is some evidence that several [[enchantment|enchantments]] designed to assist the invading armies originated among the stones and cairns. 

The ring consists of thirteen standing stones, around and between which are scattered low cairns of carved rocks. The stones are intricately threaded with mithril designs that denote the history of the battles with the Thule in Skarsind - both the recent invasion and liberation, and older conflicts stretching back to the dawn of Wintermark. The stones "draw up" mana flows from deep underground, and the crystals produced form on and around the rocky cairns. The crystals gathered here have a distinctive silvery tinge, that the a few [[Wintermark_culture_and_customs#Art_and_history|scops]] have claimed makes them resemble tears.
