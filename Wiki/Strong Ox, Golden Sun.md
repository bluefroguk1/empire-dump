## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects

This ritual completely replaces the effect of [[Blessing of New Spring]].

The target farm earns an additional 50 rings at the Summer Solstice (event 3) and the Autumn Equinox (event 4). The ritual ends at the start of winter. 

This spell is intended to be cast at the Spring Equinox. If the spell is cast later in the year, then money that would have been gained in earlier seasons is lost. It is useless if performed after the Summer Solstice. 



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional farms in the same territory. Each additional farm increases the magnitude by 2. The character who controls each farm must be present throughout the ritual.

## Description

This spell is intended to be cast at the Spring Equinox. It is less efficient and productive if cast later in the year and is useless if performed after the Summer Solstice.  If the spell is cast later in the year, then money that would have been provided during any missed seasons is lost. Performed at the optimal time, and left to run its full course, the ritual provides a total of 100 rings of additional profit to the owner of the target farm.

A farm affected by the ritual will provide more and better crops, increasing the amount of money at the summer and autumn equinoxes. Once it is in place, it also allows for more powerful rituals to be cast. In the same way that it requires [[Blessing of New Spring]] to be in place before it can be cast, it serves as an anchor for the [[Gathering the Harvest]] ritual, permitting even more wealth to be reaped from the soil. 

As with the blessing of new spring, this is a very old ritual indeed. It enchants both domesticated beasts of burden and farm-workers alike, giving them great stamina and keeping them hearty and hale. Oxen can haul a plough for days on end without complaint, while labourers find their exertions tire them, but do not exhaust them. The fields themselves burst with grain, and herds of animals are hardy, healthy and gain strength to fight off predators and disease alike.

The ritual is understandably popular in [[The Marches]], and there are [[Groups#Covens|covens]] of [[Landskeeper|landskeepers]] who work hard to ensure that they can perform this ritual on many farms simultaneously. Such covens also work to master [[Blessing of New Spring]] and [[Gathering the Harvest]] if they can, and know that their ability to perform this ritual gives them a useful political tool when dealing with the [[Marcher household|households]] and [[Monastery|monasteries]].

## Common Elements
The ritual grants strength and endurance to the creatures and plants on a farm. Ritual performances often include the evocation of the rune [[Verys]] or the constellation of [[The Oak]]. Hearth magics and symbols associated with strength and agricultural [[Prosperity]] are also commonly evoked, such as sweat, salt, honey, ale, milk or grain.

In [[the Marches]], a portion of the produce that the farm produced the previous year might be used in the ritual. In a similar way, a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Varushka magical traditions#Cabalists|cabal]] or circle of [[Wintermark]] magicians might use honey made in an especially prosperous year with fresh-baked runebread, to draw a connection between ''then'' and ''now''.

The [[magic items|magic item]] known as the [[Straw Mask]] can be used to make this ritual easier to perform.
