## Overview
The Broker of Treji Wayhouse is an [[Imperial title]]  awarded to a [[Navarr]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in [[Karov#Delev|Delev]].

In the years since Skarsind was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the [[Wintermark]] focus was more on the routes through the passes into [[Hahnmark]] in the north-east. Over Winter 379YE, [[The_worth_of_a_life#Crossroads_of_the_North|work began]] on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with [[Bonesetter of Torfast Trading Post|Torfast Trading Post]] in [[Skarsind]] as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Temeschwar]] and [[Karov]].

In Summer 381YE, in response to an [[opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner [[Construct_a_road_connecting_the_Thule_to_the_Torfast_Trading_Post|joined]] the Northern Trade Network bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while the Empire remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the [[Temeschwar#Metri|forests of Metri]] threatened to sever [[Temeschwar]] from the network, leading to [[Don%27t_blame_me#Broken_Hospitality|instability along the trade routes]], reducing the options available to the Broker. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the Rod and Shield were [[384YE_Winter_Solstice_Conclave_sessions#Concord:_Rod_and_Shield_and_Metri|instructed]] to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  [[Fade_out_again#A_Disturbing_Encounter|disruption]] to trade end.

During the Summer of 385YE, following the [[Construct Temeschwar Otkodov Mana Exchange|construction]] of the [[Keeper of the Tome|Temeschwar-Otkodov Mana Exchange]] far more traders from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead. The [[Deep_forests_and_dark_hills#Northern_Prosperity|completion of the Iron Roads]] saw an influx of [[Varushka|Varushkan]] trade goods passing through [[Overseer_of_the_Westward_Road|Delev Market]] in [[Karov]], providing additional opportunities to purchase goods.

## Responsibilities
The Broker is expected to keep the trade flowing along the roads that lead from Skarsind west through Hercynia and to the rest of the Empire. The close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Broker to acquire supplies at bargain prices from merchants heading both to and from Skarsind.

As a [[ministry]], the title of Broker of Treji Wayhouse allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The Broker makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable materials easily through Delev market.

Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the cost to purchase crystal mana has increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the crystal mana and the dragonbone are ''both'' subject to tariffs when they cross the border with the Thule nation. The Imperial Senate [[384YE_Autumn_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Amend_Trade_with_the_Thule_II|voted]] to amend tariffs on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them [[Tariffs#Free_Trade|free trade]] which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before sanctions were imposed.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice by Navarr who control [[herb garden]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the herb garden an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a Navarr character may hold this title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. They cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
