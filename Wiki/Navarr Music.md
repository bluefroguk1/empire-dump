## The Music of Navarr
### Style summary
Navarr music reflects a dichotomy of wistful remembrance for their old culture and the practicalities of survival in the wild. Recent music has a practicality underlying it. Loud and high calling noises appear throughout the music in order to develop vocal cords for the relay of messages, cries of warning and the roar of a fear inducing charge from hiding. Drumming is widely used for similar reasons. The sounds, in contrast to the melodic music of their old culture, are often harsh which reflects the Navarr attitude towards nature - not one of harmony but of dominance. Much of the music of their lost cities has changed over time to include primal sounds, for example, fast fiddle and pipes or soft unison singing is joined by loud calling and percussion. Lyrics reflect the dichotomy of the memory of lost cities and the practicalities of life in the wild. References to nature are common but are dark and evocative rather than romantic. Work songs and cautionary tales are common as are the themes of travelling, fate, forests, and blood.  Songs of the old culture; lost cities and sacrifice concentrate on remembrance rather than lamentation.
__TOC__
To achieve this sound, look at music that fuses Celtic folk styles with African and Amazonian sounds . Music can draw on Scottish, Irish, Greek, Galician, and Basque/French folk tunes as well Tolkienesque fantasy for lyrics, with added African-style percussion (such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6oYeq7FfqI Ngoma], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN8MEam_HL8 Mutuashi] and [https://youtu.be/CDquKtgHYp4 Didadi]), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZMo9Humf-0 Amazonian] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfzJJadT8gw Amazigh] music, to fuse with the sounds of the old culture.

### A musical tradition
Music has a practical use in Navarr society.  Music plays a prominent part to create social harmony and to invoke the powers from beyond. It is used for work songs and for teaching.  

Social rituals are often performed to music, such as courtship rituals where one lead, supported by their chorus, makes their case, and the other lead, supported by their own chorus, questions them. 

Blood Rituals often rely on percussion support to evoke the feel of the pumping heart and helps focus the arts of the Vates.

### How to adapt your repertoire
* Western Folk tradition - Stick to folk songs from the folk traditions mentioned as sources or that have a primal sound. Simplify arrangements and then maybe add non-western rhythms, percussion, shouting, calling and mouth music. This will lend the sense that the old culture has been a little forgotten over time and will give added poignancy to the occasional song performed with a pure 'Celtic' sound. Maybe keep one or two songs unchanged and perform them unaccompanied as a powerful reminder of the old culture.
* Non-western traditions - Move songs into English.  Try to lean melodies towards a more 'Celtic' sound.
* Try to avoid frenzied drumming circles - the Navarr are an urban culture turned traveller, but wants to return to city life – and try to avoid the ceilidh vibe.  Jigs and waltzes don't match the [[Navarr Look and Feel|feel]] of primal otherworldliness.

### Our sources
* Modern Gaelic artists; Modern Welsh Language Artists such as Fern Hill; World Fusion such as Afrocelt Sound System (although less electronic) and Baka Beyond;  Scottish-influenced Canadian songs and tunes e.g. Ashley MacIsaac, Great Big Sea (although less poppy), the instrumental stuff by Shooglenifty e.g. Arms Dealer's Daughter (CD), Michael McGoldrick (e.g. Wired), Irish folk, Greek folk tunes and dances. modern pipers e.g. Finlay MacDonald,
* Travel-themed songs and poems by Tolkien could provide inspiration e.g. http://allpoetry.com/poem/8500011-I_Sit_And_Think-by-J_R_R_Tolkien and the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBgxqN0HOI8 Misty Mountain song] is spot on for the Navarr sound.
