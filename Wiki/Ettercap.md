## Overview
Ettercap is a catch-all term given to the insect-like abominations that thrive in areas infested with the [[vallorn]]. They demonstrate a great deal of diversity, some scouts claim that no two ettercaps are exactly the same. They range in size from small, fast, stealthy killers to large, lumbering monsters larger than a bear. Some incorporate obvious non-insect characteristics (fur and patches of scales are most common). Some have demonstrated considerable cunning, while others have simply charged the nearest target in the area as soon as they were spotted.

One characteristic all seem to have in common, and share with the [[vallornspawn husk]], is that they are not debilitated by the [[vallorn#Vallorn miasma|vallorn miasma]]. Indeed, they appear to thrive within the miasma - there are reports that some ettercaps fought in the confines of a vallorn-infested forest have demonstrated incredible regenerative capabilities.
