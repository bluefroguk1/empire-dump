## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

 

### Effects

The target gains three additional ranks of [[Combat skills#Fortitude|fortitude]], and is under a [[roleplaying effect]]: you feel vigorous and potent, as if you were at the height of your physical peak.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 6. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

Even more so than [[Tenacity of Jotra]], this ritual provides a significant boost to a warrior's ability to survive serious wounds for several months. While it is at its most effective when it enhances the constitution of an individual who is already quite tenacious, it is still quite powerful regardless of target. Even when cast on someone of unremarkable constitution, it more than doubles the amount of time it takes someone to die from their wounds.

## Common Elements
As with many [[enchantment]] rituals, common elements include the consumption of wholesome food and drink (especially mead or beer) and the use of tokens and gifts such as [[Dawn hearth magic#Favours|favours]]. The rune [[Jotra]] is often used, painted onto the skin especially the skin of the chest or belly. Likewise an evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of horses, boars, bears and other animals famed for their bodily fortitude.
