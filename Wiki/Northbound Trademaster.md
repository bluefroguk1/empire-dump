## Overview
The Northbound Trademaster is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a [[the League|League]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in [[Karov#Delev|Delev]].

In the years since Skarsind was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the Wintermark focus was more on the routes through the passes into Hahnmark in the north-east. Over Winter 379YE, [[The_worth_of_a_life#Crossroads_of_the_North|work began]] on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with [[Bonesetter of Torfast Trading Post|Torfast Trading Post]] in [[Skarsind]] as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Temeschwar]]; [[Overseer of the Westward Road|merchant offices]] in the town of [[Karov#Delev|Delev]] in [[Karov]], and a brokerage in [[Hercynia]] known as the [[Broker of Treji Wayhouse|Treji Wayhouse]].

In Summer 381YE, in response to an [[opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner [[Construct_a_road_connecting_the_Thule_to_the_Torfast_Trading_Post|joined]] the Northern Trade Network bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while the Empire remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while the Empire remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. 

Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the [[Temeschwar#Metri|forests of Metri]] threatened to sever [[Temeschwar]] from the network, leading to [[Don%27t_blame_me#Broken_Hospitality|instability along the trade routes]], reducing the options available to the Trademaster. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the Rod and Shield were [[384YE_Winter_Solstice_Conclave_sessions#Concord:_Rod_and_Shield_and_Metri|instructed]] to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  [[Fade_out_again#A_Disturbing_Encounter|disruption]] to trade end.

During the Summer of 385YE, following the [[Construct Temeschwar Otkodov Mana Exchange|construction]] of the [[Keeper of the Tome|Temeschwar-Otkodov Mana Exchange]], far more traders from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead. At the same time the [[Deep_forests_and_dark_hills#Northern_Prosperity|completion of the Iron Roads]] saw an influx of [[Varushka|Varushkan]] trade goods passing through [[Overseer_of_the_Westward_Road|Delev Market]] in [[Karov]], providing additional opportunities to purchase goods.

## Responsibilities
The Trademaster is expected to keep the trade flowing along the roads that lead from Temeschwar north into Skarsind and south to the wider Empire. The close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Trademaster to acquire supplies at bargain prices. To a lesser degree, the Northbound Trademaster can be seen as responsible for keeping an eye on trade opportunities across the northern Empire, and ensuring that League merchants are able to take advantage of them.

As a [[ministry]], the title of Northbound Trademaster allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials traded from the north at a set price. The Trademaster makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable materials easily through Delev market.

Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the cost to purchase crystal mana has increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the crystal mana and the beggar's lye are ''both'' subject to tariffs when they cross the border with the Thule nation. The Imperial Senate [[384YE_Autumn_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Amend_Trade_with_the_Thule_II|voted]] to amend tariffs on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them [[Tariffs#Free_Trade|free trade]] which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before sanctions were imposed.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice  by citizens of the League who control [[business]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the business an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a League character may hold this title, but there is no requirement for them to be from Temeschwar (the title notionally represents opportunities for trade for the entire League). They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As an Imperial title appointed through the Bourse, they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
