Marching to Victory
by the Gremani Family

Chorus:
Come join with me in song, to war we march along
Fighting for fame and treasure, leaving our life of leisure
The buckler and the blade, the weapons of our trade
War is the greatest pleasure
Marching to Victory!

Thieves may rob you of your treasures golden
Fame's a coin that never can be stolen

Chorus:

Place your lover's ring upon your finger
And look back when at the gate you linger

Chorus:

Those at home will keep the fires burning
All to welcome us on our returning

Chorus:

If you find me with the dead and dying
Kiss my lips and leave me where I'm lying

Chorus:

Even death can't rob us of our glory
Our deeds will live on in song and story

Chorus:

Dressed for war, Don Cesare's a charmer
All the bravos love a man in armour

Chorus:
