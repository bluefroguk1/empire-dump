## Overview
The Keeper of Aurelie's Garden is an [[Imperial title]] [[Construct_Aurelie's_Garden|commissioned]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 380YE. The position of keeper is a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of valuable herbs. The garden is in the region of [[Astolat#Grovesyard|Grovesyard]], [[Astolat]], near the hospital Aurelie's Rest. 

During the Summer Solstice 383YE, following some considerable confusion about how the title was appointed, the civil service proposed an [[Senate_motion#Administrative_Motions|administrative motion]] to [[Amend Aurelie's Garden]]. The method of appointment was changed to unanimous decision of the [[senator|senators]] of [[Navarr]] and [[Dawn]], in a similar fashion to the way titles such as the [[Spider%27s_Tollkeep|Spider's Tollkeep]] are appointed,

## Responsibilities
The Keeper has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of herbs from the Aurelie's Garden. If the Garden were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Keeper to deal with those threats. 
## Powers
### Bounty of Herbs
The Keeper gains custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. Each season they receive 10 doses of [[Imperial Roseweald]], and 2 doses each of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], [[True Vervain]], [[Marrowort]], and [[Bladeroot]].
## Appointment
The Keeper of Aurelie's Garden is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[senator|senators]] of [[Dawn]] and [[Navarr]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. The intention is that the senators will ensure that a suitable contest to identify the appropriate candidate is arranged and overseen. Legally, however, all that is required to appoint the title is a unanimous agreement between the senators of Dawn and Navarr.

The title can be held by either a Navarr citizen or a citizen of Dawn.The Keeper serves for a year, until they die, or until they step down.

In accordance with its peculiar method of appointment, the title can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Navarr [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], the National Assembly of Dawn, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
