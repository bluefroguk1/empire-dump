## Overview
A fleet represents one or more ships; it could be a single large swift vessel or a fleet of half a dozen much smaller vessels. 

## Military Strength
In military terms, a starting fleet is the equivalent of 100 marines - it has a military strength of 100. By comparison, a normal Imperial navy has an effective military strength of 5000.

This means that when the skills and experience of a starting fleet are assigned to an action then they add a military strength of 100 to the action. The combined military strength of all participants is crucial for the success of most military actions. If the action is privateering - then the wealth received by the fleet is dependent on its military strength.

Each upgrade increases the military strength of the fleet by 20 with enchantments providing similar bonuses.
## Downtime Options
Each downtime, the player can choose one of three different types of action which are described in general terms below.
Privateering
Any fleet can always choose to engage in privateering. This happens automatically if the owner does not select any other option. The unit has an equal chance of gaining herbs, ingots or measures, money, or mana crystals as a result of this action - as if it were an appropriate resource of equivalent level. 

You are free to roleplay the details of this attack as you wish, as it does not have an impact on the ongoing campaign. Please bear in mind however that you cannot use this action to commit piracy against nations the Empire is not at war with due to the presence of the [[Employ Civil Service to observe Fleets|Civil Service observers]]. 
The production the fleet gains is based on the option the player selects each downtime. If the option provides any benefits, then they will usually be dependent on the military strength of the fleet. Depending on the actions taken, the fleet may receive the [[#Imperial_Guerdon|Imperial guerdon]].

If a player does not select a downtime option for their fleet, then the unit defaults to privateering. A new player who starts with a fleet receives a random trading result; it is not possible to choose an action for your fleet before you attend your first event.

### Take Independent Action
A fleet can choose to take independent action. They will always be able to choose to take privateering; other options may be available depending on the campaign.

Privateering provides a standard return based on the rank of the fleet, but ''other independent actions do not provide any returns by default''. Make sure to check what production is shown when you select the action from the dropdown if that it is important.

### Trade
A fleet may trade at any [[Foreign ports|foreign port]] that is open to Imperial shipping, usually this is the main port of any nation that the Empire is at peace with. Each port provides different commodities for the fleet owner and production can also vary from season to season based on the state of the relationship between the foreign country and the Empire.

[[Powers_of_the_Imperial_Senate#Diplomatic|Declarations of war and peace]] are in the hands of the [[Imperial Senate]] and [[The Throne]], but foreign nations may also choose to restrict the access of Imperial shipping to their ports - or even close them altogether if they are offended by the actions of the Empire.

### Supporting a Naval Campaign
A fleet can choose to support an Imperial navy. They will always be able to support any [[Imperial navy]], provided a navy exists; at present the Empire does not have any navies to support. Other military engagements may be available depending on the campaign.

Any fleets assigned to support a navy are automatically assumed to help carry out the orders issued to the navy by the admiral, whatever they may be. You can see what order you will be supporting when you select a navy to support.

## Imperial Guerdon
Fleets do not automatically earn wealth unless they take privateering, a type of independent action. Other options may provide income for the fleet, but they do not do so by default.

The [[Quartermaster General of the Imperial Armies]] has control of the Imperial guerdon, a purse drawn from the Imperial treasury to recompense commanders who act in the interests of the Empire. It is shared between military units whose actions the Quartermaster deems eligible. The Quartermaster makes an announcement to the Imperial Senate each season to indicate which military options will benefit - they may choose any of the options available - they could even give the guerdon to those units taking paid work if they cared to.

The value of the Imperial guerdon is divided between each captain whose military unit supports an army in proportion to the military strength of their unit. The Senate may vote to increase or decrease the size of this fund.

## Upgrades
A fleet can be upgraded using [[weirwood]] obtained from the [[Imperial Bourse]]. Each time a fleet is upgraded, the military strength of the unit is increased by 20. This means a 20% increase in returns from privateering, and a similar proportional increase in the share of the guerdon assigned to the fleet if it receives the guerdon.

When trading, a fleet produces more valuable resources each time it is upgraded, according to this chart of [[Foreign_ports|foreign ports]].

To upgrade a fleet requires Imperial wains of weirwood equal to the level the fleet is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 fleet costs 2 Imperial wains of weirwood, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.

## Diversification
A fleet cannot be diversified.
## Adventures
In addition to the normal actions a fleet can take, there are also ''adventures''. These are downtime actions that have arisen through player action, often as the result of a wind of fortune. Most are accessible through the independent action dropdown, and count as such for purposes of rituals. Instead of providing random rewards, however, they provide specific benefits. Each adventure lists the rewards a standard fleet will receive, and an upgraded or enchanted resource will gain proportionately more. 

Some adventures are temporary; they are usually listed on the interlude page for as long as they are available. Others are permanent - or will last until a certain condition is met. Not every adventure is available to every character equally - some are much less productive for some nations, or may be available only to characters that meet a specific criteria. In each case, you're encouraged to make up stories about your downtime actions in keeping with the details here. Profound Decisions won't provide any additional information to someone whose fleet engages in one of these adventures - in that they're just like the ''[[#Paid Work|paid work]]'' action.
### Escort the Fisherfolk of Westerhal
This adventure is only available to Wintermark fleet owners. During the [[Under heaven|raid on Skallahn]] following the Summer Solstice 384YE, the folk of Westerhal in the Kallavesa West Marsh helped transport warriors into Skallahn. With Imperial domination of the Gullet, the thane of Westerhal put into operation a bold plan; with the support of Winterfolk war-vessels, their fishing boats can now fish the rich waters of the western and northern Gullet, and bring in a great deal of Prosperity to western Kallavesa. 

Rather than receiving random production a standard military unit will receive 90 rings and 5 random magical metals from their adventure. An upgraded or enchanted fleet will receive proportionately more of both.

### Raid Kalsea's coastline
This adventure is only available to Marcher fleet owners. Following their role in the [[Under heaven|raid on Skallahn]] after the Summer Solstice 384YE, Jarvey "Strongoar" Oddsboy, the steward of the small Marcher household who oversees Steward's Landing, has turned their small quayside into a base of operation from which Marcher captains can raid the Jotun coast. Oddsboy and his fellow coastal stewards heartily support such raids, seeing them as opportunities to get back at the Jotun who have wreaked so much havoc in Bregasland and Mournwold. Exploiting the well-known Jotun reticence to put to sea, and the pacifism of the orc thralls, Marcher ship captains are able to launch surprise raids on coastal settlements, steal valuable goods and metals, and either fight the warriors when they arrive or escape before the orcs even know they are there.

Rather than receiving random production a standard military unit will receive 90 rings and 5 random magical metals from their adventure. An upgraded or enchanted fleet will receive proportionately more of both, with an emphasis on metals.

### Hunt the Monsters
This adventure is only available to Wintermark, Marcher, and Freeborn fleet owners. Following the expansion of the port in Caitun it is now possible for fleets along the Gullet, or the Freeborn, to hunt the monsters that lurk in the dark, cold waters of the [[Sea of Snow]]. 

A starting fleet that chooses to spend the season hunting the area receives an ingot of [[weltsilver]] and other luxuries worth 3 crowns from the grateful Faraden fishing community. It is a somewhat return and not worth the effort to many. Only if the vessel is large and powerful enough to defeat a seahemoth would the returns be worthwhile when compared to other actions. A fleet with a military strength of two hundred or more will return with a bounty of precious seahemoth oil, while a ship with three hundred or more military strength will be able to recover pieces of whale horn. There are only a tiny number of fleets in the Empire capable of hunting a kraken, but a fleet with a military strength of four hundred or more - whether from upgrades or rituals - will return with kraken's ink as their reward.
