* Magistrate's interpretation: A declaration of peace (or war) can only be absolute because a senate motion cannot compel the actions of a future senate. The conditions referred to above are therefore provided for information purposes only. In the event that the conditions are not fulfilled (or for any other reason) a future senate may raise a motion to declare war on the Lasambrian Orcs.
* After the Autumn Equinox, the Lasambrian orcs ceded the regions of [[Segura]] they controlled back to the Empire and withdrew into the Lasambrian hills.
* The [[Dawn military concerns#Eastern Sky|Eastern Sky]] [[Imperial armies|Imperial army]] of [[Dawn]] claimed the vacated regions for the Empire; there was some token resistance from a few orcs who refused to withdraw from the Empire, and from bandits who had prospered without Imperial law.
