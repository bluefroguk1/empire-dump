__NOTOC__
To restore the Basilica of the Seven Doors, with the aid of the Custodes Clavium. This will formally create the title ‘Speaker of the Highborn Assembly’, and act as a sinecure granting a congregation to the holder. This will be appointed during the Winter Solstice due to special request, and will be appointed by the Highborn National Assembly. Due to the aid of the Custodes Clavium, it will not require a civil service commission slot, and the cost is being met entirely by the Custodes Clavium and the Benefactors of Highguard; as such, it is self-funded.
