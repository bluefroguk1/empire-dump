## Definition
A forest represents an area of woodlands that are harvested to gain magical materials. It shouldn't be a farm or a garden - if that is what you want to take then we would recommend you choose the farm resource or a herb garden resource instead. 

## Production
Upon taking a forest, you must choose one of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]], [[Materials#Beggar.27s_Lye|beggar's lye]], [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], or [[Materials#Iridescent_Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. A forest produces 12 measures of the chosen material.

## Downtime Options

It is possible to harvest additional materials from a forest during any given season. You may spend 6 crowns to have the forest produce an additional 5 measures of the same material as it would naturally produce.

## Upgrades
A forest can be upgraded using [[white granite]] obtained from the Bourse. Each time a forest is upgraded, the owner receives an additional 2 measures from then on.

To upgrade a forest requires Imperial wains of white granite equal to the level the forest is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 forest costs 2 Imperial wains of white granite, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.

## Diversification
A forest can be diversified to sacrifice production of one material for another. To diversify a forest costs one throne. Each time a forest diversifies, the owner chooses a different resource from the list for forests; the forest produces 2 measures of the new material at the expense of 2 less of the original material. A forest can be diversified multiple times (but no more than once per season), and each time it is diversified, the owner can choose any of the three resources the forest would not normally produce.

## Rituals
The table below shows a list of the rituals in both Imperial lore and Urizen lore which can affect the production of a forest.
