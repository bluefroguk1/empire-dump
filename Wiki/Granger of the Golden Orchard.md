## The Golden Orchards of Miaren
From a distance the [[Miaren#Serenael|Serenael]] orchard looks home to normal apple trees, with golden fruit hanging from their branches. 

However when one draws closer, its arcane nature becomes clear. At the centre of the orchard, surrounded by beautiful apple trees, lies a single great weirwood tree, coiled around by massive briars and thorns. These are treacherous to climb, tearing clothes and skin in equal measure. The attendants of the Orchard receive training such that they are able to safely wend their way through the branches to pluck the mana crystals from the tree. 

The crystal mana forms where the thorns of the surrounding brambles pierce the bark of the underlying tree. The sap weeps at these points and, with the aid of appropriate techniques, solidifies and crystallises to form a piece of mana.
