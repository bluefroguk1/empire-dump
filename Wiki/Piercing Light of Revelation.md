## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 This ritual may target any single creature, item or effect that is present throughout. It may target any [[enchantment]] on a resource, region or territory within the Empire if performed using the Anvil [[regio]]. It may target any [[enchantment]] on a resource, region or territory outside the Empire with the use of a strong Day regio in the same region or territory.

### Effects
This ritual pierces and drives away obfuscation and deception. It has a number of functions.
* It opens a [[night pouch]]. The night pouch is destroyed in the process.
* It will allow an [[enchantment|enchanted]] night pouch created with the [[Secrets for the Shadow Courier]] ritual to be opened provided that ''Piercing Light of Revelation'' is performed at a magnitude equal to or greater than that ritual. The pouch is destroyed in the process.
* It will permanently remove the [[enchantment]] created by any obfuscation or concealment created by a Night ritual provided that ''Piercing Light of Revelation'' is performed at a magnitude at least twice that of the target enchantment. If the ritual does not have sufficient magnitude to remove the shroud, it fails. This does ''not'' reveal information about the magnitude of the shroud.
* It ''may'' permanently remove a [[curse]] that creates obfuscation or concealment. The magnitude should be at least twice that of the target curse.

### Additional Magnitude
You may increase the magnitude of the ritual in order to pierce more powerful rituals of concealment.

## Description

This ritual is primarily used for forcing open [[night pouch|night pouches]]. It is quite effective at overcoming the magic of an incantation, but finds it harder to force open the more durable pouches created by [[Secrets for the Shadow Courier]]. The ritual will also destroy the effects of more powerful rituals that create concealing or obfuscating [[enchantment|enchantments]], but the ritual must be performed with overpowering strength - the magnitude must be double that of the target ritual, or the ''Piercing Light of Revelation'' fails. 

In most cases, the ''Piercing Light of Revelation'' is used for destroying night pouches; it is rarely as effective to remove a concealing enchantment as it is to simply force one's way past it using a divination. Exceptions exist - rituals that create durable concealments are generally only pierced by divination for a short time, and there are some such as [[Vale of Shadows]] that need to be removed before the target resource can be conquered.

## Common Elements
This ritual often includes some combination of fire, light, mirrors and the rune [[Ophis]], representing the evocation of overpowering might.
