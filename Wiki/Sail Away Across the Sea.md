Original tune is called Los Set Gotxs Recomptarem, words by Daisy and Jude.

RECORDING of this song : [[Media:sail-away.mp3]]

[[File:sail-away.jpg|200px|thumb|left]] 
Watch out for the 5/4 bar, if you want add a rest beat at the end of each "Haul away " line so it doesn't throw out your accompanying drummers! Or get the drummers to add in a beat's rest at the end of the line like in the recording.

Waves on the prow and spray in the air
''Come along with me and sail across the ocean''
Salt on my skin and wind in my hair
''Come along with me and sail across the ocean''

Chorus:
Haul away and sail across the ocean!
Haul away and sail across the sea!

Anchors away and hands to the oars
''Come along with me and sail across the ocean''
Setting a course for far away shores 
''Come along with me and sail across the ocean''

Chorus

Storms in the east and sun's in the west
''Come along with me and sail across the ocean''
A life on the rolling sea is the best
''Come along with me and sail across the ocean'

Chorus
