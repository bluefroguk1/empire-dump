## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects
The military unit gains a significant bonus to its effectiveness when it is assigned to [[Military_unit#Support_Army|support an army]] or [[Military_unit#Defend_Fortification|defend a fortification]]. 

While the military unit is enchanted the character who controls it experiences a roleplaying effect: you are always looking for opportunities to cooperate with others; the success of a group you belong to becomes more important to you than your own success. The effect persists for at least ten minutes after the ritual is complete.





### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional military units controlled by members of the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional military unit increases the magnitude by 6. The character who controls each unit must be present throughout the ritual.
