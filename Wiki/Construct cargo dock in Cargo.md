__NOTOC__
### Overview
* A [[ministry]] built to purchase white granite from the [[Sarcophan Delves]] in [[Redoubt#Cargo|Cargo]], [[Redoubt]]
* Passed

### Date
* Winter 380YE

### Cost
* 10 White Granite and 40 Weirwood
* Labour: 12 Thrones 4 Crowns 
* Time: 3 months

### Progress
* 40 Weirwood, 10 White Granite and 12 Thrones, 4 crowns provided by Thanmir Hrafn after the Summer Solstice 381YE.

### Campaign Outcome
* There are [[Commission#Necessary_Details|necessary details]] missing from this motion, Senator Madruga may decide on these.
* Completion of the docks creates the title [[Custodian_of_the_Concordium_Dock|Bewaarder van het Vandersaar dok]]
* When complete the docks will create an Imperial title that will function as a [[ministry]], but allow the purchase of white granite from the Sarcophan Delves. The agreed rate is:
** 32 crowns each wain for the first 8 wains
** 29 crowns each wain for the second 8 wains
** 26 crowns each wain for the last 8 wains
* The [[New_Imperial_titles#Well_Worn_Paths|well worn path]] for appointing the title associated with these docks you be as an Imperial or National title [[New_Imperial_titles#The_Imperial_Bourse|appointed]] through the [[Imperial Bourse|Bourse]]
* As a ministry, these docks do not have an upkeep - the suggestion that they did was in error.
