## Happiston Fields
Entitled in the Senate motion as the ''Prosperous Potato Fields of Happiston'' (pronounced Haze-tun), the fields are known to most simply as the Happiston Fields, located as they are near the recently refurbished settlement of Happiston in the [[Mournwold#Chalk Downs|Chalk Downs]] of the Mournwold. Whilst these fields are planted with a potato crop each year, it is the scarecrows scattered across them that bring the more valuable harvest. Each of these scarecrows features sturdy mithril rods as part of their construction, and their careful placement harnesses the flow of ambient magic to cause mana crystals to crystallise from the soil itself. These crystals - often darker and more earthy in appearance than others, though just as functional - are harvested by the folk that tend the fields almost as if they were regular crops, albeit with a degree more care.
