Original Song by Jamie Wakefield  (https://soundcloud.com/jamie-wakefield/thorn-battle-cadence) 

Chords: Am Em G Am


Call
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.

Response 1 ''(repeated after each line)''
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.

Calls
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.

In the day or in the night we take our victory.
In the dark or in the light we're running through the trees.

Sure and swift, our arrows fly.
Upon our spears, all will die.

Know no mercy, heed no plea.
You cannot betray your enemy.

The blood will flow!

Response 2 ''(repeated after each line)''
The blood will flow!

Calls
The blood will flow!

From the wounds of our foes!
From the wounds of our foes!

Their guts we'll spill!
With every kill!

KILL! KILL! KILL!
KILL! KILL! KILL!

As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.

Response 1 ''(repeated after each line)''
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.

Calls
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.

Know no mercy, heed no plea.
You cannot betray your enemy.

As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.
