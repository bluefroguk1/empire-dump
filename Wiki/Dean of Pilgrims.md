## Appointment
The Dean of Pilgrims was an Imperial position [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#Imperial_Position|appointed by the Senate]]. Any Imperial citizen could hold the title. The Dean had [[Imperial_title#Term_of_office|tenure]], and served until they die or stepped down. They could be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]] and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Pilgrims' Annexe
During the Winter Solstice 378 YE, the Senate approved an annexe to the spire of the Imperial Academy. A light, airy, octagonal building was constructed at the base of [[Morrow#Canterspire|the Canterspire]]. Each face is decorated and illustrated with symbols of [[the Way]], and with images of famous [[Paragons and Exemplars]]. Illustrated scrolls, books, and other learning materials are stored in a number side areas, waiting patiently to be used by pupils. It also contains a record of donations to the Academy, as well as the stores of additional liao themselves.

As the threat of the [[Druj]] against [[Urizen]] grew, the Academy staff took the [[The_arch_of_the_door|difficult decision]] to move from Canterspire to the [[Astolat#Castle of Thorns|Castle of Thorns]] in [[Astolat]]. As a consequence the Annexe was abandoned, and the Dean of Pilgrims lost access to their sinecure. While the title technically still exists, it has no powers, and has not been reappointed.
