 This page refers to an obsolete Imperial Title; the civilian commissioners were [[Abrogate_Civilian_Commissioners|abrogated]] by the Senate during the Winter 380YE summit.
## Overview
Each nation of the Empire appointed a civilian commissioner to oversee construction of [[sinecure|sinecures]], [[ministry|ministries]], and [[great work|great works]] in that nation. The commissioner was usually selected by the [[senator|senators]] of their nation but in rare circumstances it was possible for them to be [[Appointments_by_the_Senate|elected by the Imperial Senate]]. Although the commissioner was not a member of the Senate, they had powers comparable to or greater than those of a senator - and any constructions they intended to [[commission]] were [[Senate_announcement|announced]] in the Senate.

The title was [[Create_titles_of_Civilian_Commissioners|created]] at the Winter Solstice summit of 379YE. It was [[Abrogate_Civilian_Commissioners|abrogated]] during the Winter Solstice 380YE, a year later.

==Responsibilities== 
The Commissioners were responsible for the prosperity of the Empire. They were expected to approve and oversee the [[commission]] of sinecures, ministries, and great works in their nation.

## Powers
### Commission
Once during each summit, each commissioner could [[commission]] the construction of a [[sinecure]], [[ministry]], or [[great work]] in their nation. The materials and money required for construction were provided by the commissioner.  A [[sinecure]] or [[ministry]] automatically created an [[Imperial title]] to oversee the commission. The new title was a national appointment by the Senate. They could only approve a commission in their one of [[territory|territories]] that is part of their nation. Control of a sinecure or ministry is a lifetime title, unless it is revoked by the General Assembly, the Council of Nine or the appropriate national Assembly.

Prior to Spring 380YE, this power was unlimited. An administrative motion [[Amend_powers_of_the_Civilian_Commissioners|amended]] the power to be usable once each season.

### Announcement
To use their power of commission, the commissioner needed to provide an [[Senate_announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who presented the decision to the Senate. No voting was possible by the Senate at this point, as the power had been delegated to the commissioner. The [[Imperial Synod]] could, however, choose to exercise their [[veto]] over the commissioner's decision.

## Limitations
A civilian commissioner could commission anything that requires an ''upkeep''.

A civilian commissioner could not commission anything that provided votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. Having such sinecures be assigned by the Senators of a nation would be unconstitutional. This meant that was not normally possible to commission a sinecure that produces [[liao]] (as sinecures that produce liao also provide votes in the Synod), without an [[opportunity]] that specifically permits such a thing.

## Selection
The commissioner was a [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|national position appointed by the Senate]]. Under normal circumstances it was appointed by unanimous vote of the senators of that nation.

Only a citizen of the appropriate nation could be appointed as the commissioner from that nation.

## Removal
A commissioner served until the next election for the title. They could be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[The_Assemblies_of_the_Synod|General Assembly]], the [[The_Assemblies_of_the_Synod#The_Assembly_of_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]] and by the appropriate [[The_Assemblies_of_the_Synod#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]] of the [[Imperial Synod]].

## History
In Spring 380YE, the Senate appointed the following people as Civilian Commissioners
* The Civilian Commissioner of The Brass Coast - Carlos I Guerra
* The Civilian Commissioner of Dawn - Morien Stewart
* The Civilian Commissioner of The Marches- Henry Ward
* The Civilian Commissioner of The Imperial Orcs - Bloodcrow Yargol
* The Civilian Commissioner of The League - Lorenzo of the Butchers
* The Civilian Commissioner of Navarr - Bron Foxden
* The Civilian Commissioner of Varushka - Nadya Gremani
* The Civilian Commissioner of Highguard - Rhesa of the Scions of Ravensfell
* The Civilian Commissioners for Wintermark and Urizen were left vacant.
At the same time, the Imperial Senate voted to restrict the powers of the civilian commissioners.

During Autumn 380YE Henry Ward resigned his post as the Civilian Commissioner of The Marches as he had just become a [[senator]].

After a year, in Winter 380YE, the Senate abrogated the motion that created the titles, meaning that they ceased to exist.
