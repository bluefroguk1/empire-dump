## Overview
The Armarius of the Anvil Library is an [[Imperial title]] [[Construct_Anvil_Library_Scriptorium|announced]] by ''Claus Friedrich von Holberg'', as [[Bearer_of_an_Imperial_Wayleave|Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] in Spring 385YE. 

## Responsibilities
The Armarius of the Anvil Library has no particular responsibilities; they are recognised as having votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] and they receive a bounty of [[liao]] from the civil service. If the Anvil Library Scriptorium were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Armarius to deal with those threats.

## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides 7 doses of [[liao]] to the Armarius each season, to be used as they see fit. 

### Voice in the Synod
The Armarius may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 14 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 14 votes if they already have a [[congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly for which [[Sinecure#Synod_Votes|they are eligible]]. 

## Anvil Library Scriptorium
The Anvil Library Scriptorium stands on the site of a much-expanded wayhouse in Foracci, along the trods from Rodez to Casinea. The Scriptorium continues to act as a wayhouse for those travelling to and from Anvil, but also for guest lecturers and researchers at the Library and associated Seminary, training priests based on a programme inspired by the works of Avigliana di Sarvos. 

Due to its role in the fight against the Whisper Gallery the Scriptorium is part of a well-defended compound, reminiscent of a Highguard chapterhouse. As well as the wayhouse and the Seminary, the walls also surround the Anvil Library Press and its associated paper- and ink-making facilities, all emblazoned with the names of the individuals and organizations who helped sponsor the Scriptorium into existence.

## Appointment
The Armarius of the Anvil Library is a [[New_Imperial_titles#The_Imperial_Synod|virtue position]] which is [[Appointment|appointed]] by [[judgement]] of the [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|Wisdom assembly]]. Any Imperial citizen may hold the title.

The Armarius has [[tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Assembly of Wisdom, and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
