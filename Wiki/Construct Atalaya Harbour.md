__NOTOC__
To disburse funds for and rebuild Atalaya Harbour to permit it to cheaply upgrade Freeborn fleets. This will not count as a shipyard.
## Overview
* Constructs the Atalaya Harbour  as detailed in the [[The_power_behind_our_moves#Atalaya|The power behind our moves]] wind of fortune.
* Passed
## Date
* Winter 384YE
## Cost
* As per the wind of fortune
* 10 wains of weirwood
* 20 wains of white granite
* 60 crowns in labour costs
* Upkeep is 5 thrones a season
## Progress

## Outcome
*  Once complete the facilities would be perfect for building and upgrading Imperial [[fleet|fleets]], allowing any Freeborn fleet based out of Madruga to be upgraded each season for one less weirwood than is usually required.
* The Grendel cannot legitimately claim that the docks breach the existing treaty, but they are aware of the threat the shipyards pose
* The docks could be quickly and cheaply expanded later to include a fully functional  [[shipyard]]. Such an expansion would only require 10 wains of white granite, 10 wains of weirwood and 20 crowns. While it would take 3 months to complete, the existing facilities would be good enough to start work on a [[Imperial navy|navy]] at the same time as the shipyard was being built, saving precious time.
* These benefits would last for as long as the new arrivals continue to live in Madruga. Once the Brass Coast reclaims Feroz, many of the new arrivals will look to return home. If that happens, then the shipyards would no longer have enough shipwrights to reduce the upgrade costs for Madruga fleets. At that point the only benefit would be to convert them into a regular shipyard as described above.
