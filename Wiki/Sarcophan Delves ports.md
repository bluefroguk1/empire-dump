## Overview
There are only two ports available to Imperial characters with the [[fleet]] resource; Sarcophan itself and Betovering. In theory it would be possible for a ship to travel further up the Umshallah River, but the Sarcophan have intentionally made the river un-navigable beyond the great sweeping bay their city occupies. Anyone wishing to trade with the nations of the interior must do so through Sarcophan.

## Sarcophan
Built among the tombs of a dead civilisation, on the edge of a fetid herb-rich swamp, the Sarcophan Delves serve as the gateway to an unknown southern continent. The great palace of beggars looms over docks teeming with merchants from all over the known world. Black monoliths stare down with unseeing eyes on the descendants of tomb-robbers and thieves who stole their wealth from the crypts of their predecessors; the wide plazas are flooded with sea water or the fetid mud of the swamps; insects hungry for blood swarm in great black clouds kept at bay by pungent censers and fly whisks. This is Sarcophan, home to some of the richest - and the poorest - people in the world.

This great city is half again the size of [[Sarvos]] or [[Temeschwar]] and has perhaps twice the population of both cities combined. Many more citizens have [[draughir]] or [[briar]] lineage than is common in the Empire, and here and there among the crowds go the shrouded and masked ''Bloedzuiger'' priests.

Sarcophan is the site of one of the wonders of the world, the palace of beggars. Visible to mariners approaching the tomb-city from many miles out to sea, this black stone tower soars nearly four hundred feet into the sky, and is said to extend great flooded galleries down into the ground beneath the city. The Sarcophan people did not build the palace, they merely occupied it when they claimed the city; at night a great beacon shines from the highest level, except on those nights when the Bedelaars meet in their great feast of politics. 

Much of the wealth of Sarcophan came originally from the relics and goods they claim from the tombs and mausoleums of the fallen predecessor civilisation, and when a new crypt is uncovered the market is flooded with grave-goods and curios. Today the city thrives on the wealth of the marsh, and on trade with both foreign merchants and traders from the interior. The swamps around the city teem with life, and both [[Marrowort]] and [[Imperial Roseweald]] are harvested in great abundance. Sarcophan prides itself on being home to some of the most talented [[surgical skills#apothecary|apothecaries]] in the world. A prolific cousin of the beggarwood tree thrives in the stinking water and mud of the marshes, and columns of black smoke rise high into the air throughout the day as the scarred labourers harvest [[materials#beggar's lye|beggar's lye]], often using the same furnaces to purify the [[materials#weltsilver|weltsilver]] they pull from the tombs, ruins and flooded mines.

### Trade with Sacrophan
A starting fleet resource that engages in trade with Sarcophan during downtime will produce 3 doses of marrowort and imperial roseweald, 3 measures of beggar's lye and 3 ingots of weltsilver. A fleet that has been [[Fleet#Upgrades|upgraded]] will produce more valuable resources according to this chart of [[foreign ports]].

## Betovering
Access to this luxurious port was secured by the Empire following the Winter Solstice 384YE. The [[Imperial Senate]] [[384YE_Winter_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Amend_tariffs_of_Sarcophan_Delves|modified trade agreements]] with merchants from the Delves to give them [[Tariffs#Free_Trade|free trade]] at Imperial ports. The delves had offered access to one of three different ports to the Empire, and the [[Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves]] selected Betovering.

### Trade with Betovering
A starting fleet resource that engages in trade with Sarcophan during downtime will produce 1 mana crystal, 5 ingots of weltsilver, and luxury goods worth 80 rings. A fleet that has been [[Fleet#Upgrades|upgraded]] will produce more valuable resources according to this chart of [[foreign ports]].
