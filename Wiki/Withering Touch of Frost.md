## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 At the end of the ritual one of the [[Rituals#Contributors|contributors]] is chosen to deliver the curse with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]].



### Effects

This ritual creates a [[curse]] that is delivered to a target with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]]: one [[Rituals#Contributors|contributor]] is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 

While under the curse, the target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]; they feel chilly almost all the time, unless they are actively warming themselves at a flame.

While under the curse the target loses a quarter of any production that would have been provided by a [[farm]], [[forest]], or [[herb garden]] resource.

The additional production provided by an [[enchantment]] such as [[Rampant Growth]] or [[Gathering the Harvest]] is not affected by this curse.



### Removing the Curse
The curse can be removed by certain powerful creatures or items.

## Description

This [[curse]] focuses the withering energies of the Winter realm onto a target, and through them onto their resources. Plants wither and die, or are attacked by parasites. It makes little difference if the target abandons their [[farm]], [[forest]], or [[herb garden]] - within a few days the same unnatural decay begins to overwhelm any new resource of that type.

Several [[eternal|eternals]] of Winter are known to have the power to remove this curse - and to deliver their own variants of it - especially [[Kaela]]. Unfortunately, she is much more inclined to encourage the curse than to discourage the supernatural famine it causes; it generally requires a great deal of effort to encourage her to assist. [[Agramant]] also has the ability to remove this curse, but generally requires unspeakable acts of blood and slaughter before he is prepared to do so. By contrast, some eternals of Spring (notably [[Yaw'nagrah]]) are more than happy to help remove the effect... but this rarely leaves the resource in question any more productive.

## Common Elements
As with many curses, this ritual often involves a recitation of the grievances against the target; casting aside food or [[forest]] resources, invoking the rune [[Naeve]], or calling on the names of eternals such as [[Kaela]] or [[Llofir]].
