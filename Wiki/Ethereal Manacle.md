## Description
These staffs are usually made of stout hardwood, treated with [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and bound with [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. Often they are decorated at either end, sometimes with grasping claws. They often have the rune [[Queros]] worked into them, and may be carved to look as if they are wound with chains. An ethereal manacle allows a magician to wield the power of the [[entangle]] incantation to root their opponents in place.

Sometimes called a ''magician's retreat'', a little contemptuously, it cannot be denied that rooting an opponent to the spot can give the bearer a good head start. A skilled battle magician, however, is quite capable of rooting an opponent to the spot and then beating them down with the advantage of superior reach - even if the magician starts the fight outnumbered the additional power of this staff can quickly even the odds. Matially-minded [[Wintermark magical traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]] and curmudgeonly [[The Marches magical traditions#Landskeepers|landskeepers]] are both known to make good use of the short time their opponents cannot move to make them regret trying to gang-up on a magician.

## Rules

* Effect: Three times per day you may cast the [[entangle]] spell as if you knew it without spending any mana.
* Materials: Crafting an ethereal manacle requires eleven measures of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and four measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], and three measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
