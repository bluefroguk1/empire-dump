## Overview
This page currently lists all the details that are specific for our third Empire event - the Summer Solstice. There is and additional page with [[event information]] which lists arrival and departure times and similar details that are common for all Empire events.

## Battles
Instead of a set of skirmishes and two large battles, we are running five smaller one hour battles at Empire. These will follow the normal rules for [[battles]]; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster at least one of the other battles if you play a battle.

The battles are linked to the ongoing campaign and which battle opportunities to take is a decision made by the generals of the [[Imperial Military Council]]. To ensure that the player generals have the maximum possible choice, we have chosen to specify when a nation is monstering, rather than specify when they are playing. This allows the generals to choose their allies and maximises the politics available to those involved with the Military Council.

### Battle Times
Each battle will last for around one hour. If you are monstering a battle, then please make your way to the monster tent at the time shown below.


    Muster TimeNations Monstering
    Saturday 10:00[[Highguard]], [[The Brass Coast]]
    Saturday 13:00[[Navarr]], [[Varushka]] 
    Saturday 16:00[[The League]], [[Urizen]]
    Saturday 19:00[[Imperial Orcs]], [[Wintermark]]
    Sunday 10:00[[Dawn]], [[The Marches]]


### Playing a Battle
The Military Council will chose which of the five available battles to commit their nation to early Friday evening. All members of that nation are then eligible to participate in that battle. Details of the choices made will be available in the civil service hub tent in the centre of the market place and distributed to the camps via the egregores.

Banners that possess a mercenary banner may choose to use it to participate in a single battle of their choice during the weekend, instead of fighting with their nation.

### Volunteering
If you are playing on one of the battles, then you must monster the battle listed for your nation above. Any player is welcome to monster any of the other battles if they wish to do so - anyone who volunteers to help by monstering an additional battle will receive a token that enables you to collect a free drink from the bar as thanks.

## The Tourney
A grand Imperial tourney will be held at the Summer Solstice. Skilled smiths and artisans in the employ of the Conclave have laboured to produce a number of powerful magical items which will be presented to the winner and the runners up. The Tourney will take place in two stages with the opening rounds on Saturday afternoon and evening culminating in the final rounds being fought on Sunday.

The tourney takes place in the purpose built arena which is at the end of the market place. Citizens of the Empire are welcome to make use of the arena outside of the scheduled tourney times.

### Participants
Each nation is able to field a band of up to forty to take part in the Tourney. Due to their large size, Highguard, The League, Wintermark, Navarr, The Marches and Varushka may choose to field two completely separate bands of 40 if they choose. Citizens may only participate in  one of their nation's bands.

### Choosing their Representatives
The egregores will work with interested citizens of each nation to decide how their champions are chosen. Citizens may choose to compete for the right to participate or adopt a different approach as they prefer. Whatever happens, a list of representatives who intend to fight must be presented to the civil servants in the Hub before 13:00 on Saturday. Those nations fielding two bands, must present two separate lists with the names of the participants.

Our civil service will arrange the schedule for the Tourney matches

### Tourney Times

    Tourney TimeTourney Contest
    Saturday 15:00Opening Rounds
    Saturday 18:00Opening Rounds
    Sunday 12:00Quarter Finals
    Sunday 14:00Final Rounds


Each session of the tourney will feature four battles, between bands from competing nations. Bands that are victorious on Saturday will fight again in the first session on Sunday. Those who go through to the finals will fight in two more battles in the final session on Sunday.

### IC Rules
Each battle in the tourney will consist of a single grand melee between two bands chosen from the competing nations. It is perfectly acceptable to use potions, items and magic, but citizens should be aware that Imperial Law holds throughout the tourney. Participants are expected to give quarter to downed foes and poison is forbidden.

## Site Map

The map shows the layout of the OOC camping fields and the IC area. The grey lines in the in-character field are roads that go through the camps. These roads will be laid out with fencing pins and nylon rope until the start of the event. You must not pitch your tent in the road, the red hats are under instructions to move any tents pitched in the IC roads.

The OOC camping area will be laid out in lines with fencing pins and nylon rope. Any tent you pitch should be pitched so that it is as close as humanly possible to the guide rope. If you have travelled by car, then please park your car so that it is to the side of your tent and close to the guide rope. Do not pitch your tents in the wide lane between the guide ropes, this lane must be kept free for access.

The Navarr have access to the adjacent section of woodland and may camp there if they choose.

### Young Player Camp
The section of the map labelled young player camp is prohibited to vehicles. This area will be roped off, so vehicles cannot enter the area (although you are welcome to park on the other side of the rope). This is one of the three demarcated areas, intended for use by young children throughout the event. The other area is the Navarr camp in the woods and the IC area around the academy. If you are the parent of guardian of a child [[http://empire.crew.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Information_for_under_7s#Avoid_the_IC_area_before_time-in|under 7]], then they must keep to a safe area before the event begins. There are no vehicles allowed on site, so once the event starts, children are welcome to go anywhere on the IC field.
