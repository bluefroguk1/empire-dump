## Description
An Apprentice's Blade is often the first item crafted by a young [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] at the beginning of their career. While they require only the most trivial amount of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] ore be worked into the metal, the process of creating the correct alloy is very time-consuming. Most apprentices have to begin the process several times, melting the blade back down again, painstakingly extracting the precious ore, and alloying the steel all over again. Once the proportions needed to create the alloy are correct, the metal must be folded and refolded hundreds of times in a seemingly never-ending series of forging and quenching and hammering. 

Completing one of these weapons is often a rite of passage; even the most dour master must admit that a crafter who can create one of these items is an apprentice no longer. Mastering the art of crafting this item is often considered proof that the artisan possesses self-discipline, due respect for the materials, and the ability to undertake complex crafting processes.

The Wintermark rune [[Jotra]] is sometimes engraved into the pommel of an Apprentice's Blade, or more commonly onto the scabbard that holds the weapon. They are sometimes called a ''Banner-bearer's Desperation'' among the Winterfolk, as they are often used by [[Wintermark military concerns#Banner-bearers|banner-bearers]] caught in dangerous circumstances.

## Rules

* Effect: You may spend a [[Heroic skills#Hero Points|hero point]] to call [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]] with this one-handed weapon.
* Materials: Crafting an Apprentice's Blade requires no special [[Materials|materials]]. It takes two months to make one of these items.


"Look boy, the price is ten crowns, take it or leave it. I'm not dropping the price for a prince, let alone a guttersnipe like you."

"Seven Crowns is all I have, take it and leave me the blade, or things will go badly for you."

"Are you threatening me boy? Oh I see, you've hired yourself a bravo. And she's going to seal this deal for you is she? Well why don't I give you a little demonstration of why my steel is worth ten crowns."

"Don't be a fool, you're a blacksmith not a warrior. You can't possibly fight my cicisbeo. Take the 7 crowns, it's a good offer."

"Boy, just because your hired thug is fucking you, doesn't make her a cicisbeo. She's a pretty lass, but if her hand draws that sword, then ambition take me, I'll take her bloody arm off."

"Don't make threats you can't keep blacksmith. Take the pouch, leave the sword, walk away. I'll let you chalk it up to experience."

The bravo's blade darted from her scabbard as she lunged forward to strike, eager to pierce the blacksmith's heart. Giorno had none of the bravo's speed but he staggered to his left and the strike took him in the shoulder. He screamed in agony, and lashed out with the sword in his hand letting the red hot fire of the wound fuel his anger. He had little skill with arms but he poured his strength and his pain into the blade feeding the magic he'd locked there. The bravo was already darting back, but not before the sword fell across her forearm. Across it and then through it, as the eager magic chewed into the muscle and the bone. The Bravo dropped to the floor screaming and clutching the bloodied stump of her ruined hand.

"I'll keep my sword and I'll keep your pouch boy. Seven crowns will pay for a physick to treat the wound your thug just gave me. And a lesson for you about smithing. The apprentice's sword is ten crowns, and it's worth every ring of that. It might be a simple enchantment, but it's the ''best'' enchantment to have if you don't know how to fight but you've got some fire in your soul. I'll let you chalk that up to experience."
