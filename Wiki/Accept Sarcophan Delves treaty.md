### Cost
* 40 wains of Weirwood and 10 wains of of White Granite

* Time: 3 months

### Campaign
* The Senator has indicated the intention to build the docks mentioned in [[Redoubt#Cargo|Cargo]], in the [[Urizen]] territory of [[Redoubt]].
* The treaty has been ratified by the Bedelaar Husibas of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] and work may begin following the Winter Solstice 380YE.

### Constitution
The Bourse shall control access to those resources that are essential to the prosperity of any great empire.

The only [[New_Imperial_titles#Well_Worn_Paths|well-worn path]] for appointing someone to oversee these docks would be to have the [[imperial title]] appointed through the [[Imperial Bourse|Bourse]]. If the title were Imperial, then it would be auctioned annually. If the title were national, it would be appointed by the citizens of the appropriate nation using their [[New_Imperial_titles#The_Imperial_Bourse|traditional methods]].

As the motion does not [[Commission#Necessary_Details|specify whether the position will be national or Imperial]] - then the civil service will look for guidance on this matter from the Senator who raised the motion.
