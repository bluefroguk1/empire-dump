## Description
The intricate needlework required to embroider a banner of the bold is time consuming in the extreme. Trace amounts of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] are used to trim and reinforce the sturdy cloth of the standard, but it is the intricate designs worked into the fabric itself that provide most of the magic. 

The true potency of this banner becomes clear when the bearer is exposed to malignant [[aura|auras]] such as those produced by some horrors or [[eternal|eternals]], evoked by [[Religious_Crimes#Heresy|heretics]] and [[Religious_Crimes#Blasphemy|blasphemers]], or brought into being by enemies of the Empire to protect key areas.

As with most magical banners, a banner of the bold bears the appropriate symbols for the heraldry or livery of the soldiers who will fight beneath it. This means that the banners are most often made for commission, although some [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] focus their attention on producing fine blank canvases which can be embroidered or painted with appropriate symbols after they have been sold.

The protection and support it offers allows the standard bearer to brave dangerous situations to support their comrades, and gives them a small measure of [[heroic skills#Hero Points|inner strength]] to draw on while they do so.

## Rules

* Effect: While wielding this standard, you gain an additional hero point, and can treat it as a source of spiritual strength for purposes of [[Roleplaying_effects#Overcoming_Roleplaying_Effects|overcoming]] roleplaying effects.
* Materials: Crafting a banner of the bold requires no special materials. It takes two months to make one of these items.

It is said that the General Halmerad always insisted on having his command banner unfurled and present when he was due to appear before the Empress Varkula.  This was, of course, a sign of martial respect, and not - as has been scandalously suggested by certain other scholars - an indication that he in any way feared his beloved Empress ...
