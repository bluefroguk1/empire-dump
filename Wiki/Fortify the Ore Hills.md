To commission a fortification, The First Step, in the region of Ore Hills, Mournwold.


Proposed by Upwold, Seconded by Hahnmark 

### Overview
* This was to begin work to complete the half-built fortification abandoned by the Jotun in Mournwold.
* Passed in principle
* Passed at 150 Thrones

### Date
* Winter 379YE.

### Cost
* 40 wains of White Granite
* 10 Thrones labour costs
* Time: 6 months to construct
* The reduced costs are due to the [[opportunity]] presented by the [[379YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#Game_Information_5|capture of a partially built Jotun fort]].

### Progress
* 150 Thrones disbursed to Senator Upwold
* 40 wains of white granite and 10 thrones provided by Silas Merrick after the Winter Solstice 379YE.

### Campaign Outcome
* Construction of this fortification has begun and will be completed shortly before the Summer solstice 380YE - assuming the Empire still controls the site of the construction.
