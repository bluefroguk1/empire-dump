## Overview
The Salt Flats of Sanath are the-eastern Druj territory of [[The Mallum]], lying across the Nameless River from [[the Barrens]]. The Empire knows very little about this [[territory]], and what they do know comes from stories related by the [[Great Forest Orcs]]. There are woodlands in the north that give way to broad plains crisscrossed by dark waterways. The ground is damp, and the further east one travels the more water there is. Eventually, one reaches the port of Leen - the Great Forest orcs believe it is the largest settlement in the Mallum, controlled by a powerful clan who also dominate the shifting islands to the east of it. The Grendel were known to visit Leen regularly trading [[mithril]] for [[weirwood]], at least until the 383YE [[Ratify_treaty_with_the_Grendel_Autumn_383YE#Treaty|treaty with the Empire]] put a temporary end to that practice.
## Recent History
After the Summer Solstice 385YE, the Empire [[A walk in shadow|sent an expeditionary force]] across the Nameless River into the Salt Flats of Sanath. They discovered the ''Sydathian Fens'', the most north-western of the regions in the territory, and not much else. They did discover that there is at least one [[fortification]] in the territory; that the [[Druj miasma]] here is particularly cloying; and that the territory is quite large (although not as large as the Barrens).
