## Overview
A Marcher household represents a group of [[Yeoman of the Marches|yeomen]], [[beater|beaters]], and crafters, led by one of their number who is called a [[steward]]. Political power in the Marches rests in the hands of the households. Households are typically from one territory, to best use their political power.

Households are defined by their group identity and shared work, rather than any familial links, thought it is not uncommon for a family to be part of a single household. It is also common for smaller households to sit under the umbrella of larger households, to benefit from their pooled resources and skills.

==Creating a household== 
A household is the easiest kind of Marcher group to create. Even the smallest household's voice can count in the [[The Marches leadership#leading a territory|process of selecting the senator for their territory]]. The group leader will be its steward and is usually the most competent politician in the group rather than a battle leader.

The core of the group will be one or more yeomen. Some of these are likely to be military characters, but not necessarily heavily-armoured soldiers. A household's yeomen are just as likely to be lightly armoured, with bills, mattocks and bows. A household may also include the crafters who live on the household's land, often a smith, a friar or two. Most households also include a few [[The Marches military concerns#Beaters|beaters]] in their number. 

You will want to choose a [[Marches_Territories|territory]] to come from: [[Upwold]] the oldest and hilliest, [[Bregasland]] home to the fen-dwellers, [[Mitwold]] with rich and rolling fields, or the [[Mournwold|Mourn]] recently reclaimed from the [[Jotun]].
