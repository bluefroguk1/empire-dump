## Description
These weapons are often decorated with, or in some cases carved from, bone or horn. In parts of [[Wintermark]] they are made from the ivory of the great narwhal, while in other areas it is common to decorate them with the bones of [[Mundane_beasts#Dire_Beasts|dire beasts]], especially great wolves. Hunters, bounty hunters and [[Imperial_Orcs_economic_interests#Thief-takers|thief-takers]] find their properties especially useful - able to prevent prey from fleeing long enough for them to be apprehended or brought down.

## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you may call [[Calls#ENTANGLE|ENTANGLE]] with this one-handed spear.
* Materials: Crafting an Oathsworn Spine requires ten measures of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and seven measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
