Based on the well-known, traditional British song, Over the Hills and Far Away.

Words by Brian Tollady.

Listen to Brian's rendition [https://youtu.be/FlMnqtgi_Is here].


With blood and bone we earnt our home,
We’ll fight and die for the Empire's throne,
Loyal soldiers, oh come what may,
Through the gate and far away,

''Through the gate and far away,
''We hope to see our home one day,
''Warlord command and we’ll obey,
''Through the gate and far away,''

We used to sing of feet on roads,
Back broken under heavy loads,
And fiercely cherished boxes hung,
With herbs and heavy fragrance swung,
But now these songs are echoes past,
Have we found our final verse at last,
If we leave or if we stay,
It's through the gate and far away,

''Chorus''

We gather once a year to raise,
The stories of our kin with praise,
Of items forged through sweat and gall,
Embodiment of virtues all,
A life of worth is often short,
For fists and blade are our retort,
War runs through our blood some say,
Oh, through the gate and far away,

''Chorus''

But from mouth to mouth this chant will fly
And, from orc to orc will never die,
A chant that beats through every vein,
To crush the question of our gain,
With blood and bone we earnt our home,
We’ll fight and die for the Empire's throne,
Loyal soldiers, oh come what may,
Through the gate and far away

''Chorus''
