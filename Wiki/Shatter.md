## Description
Where [[repel]] uses magical force to drive a target away, and [[entangle]] uses that force to prevent a foe from escaping or following the [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]], the ''shatter'' spell focuses that force to destroy objects. It is often used to destroy shields to render an opponent vulnerable; pole-arms and pikes to remove the advantages granted by their great reach; or the weapons of an opponent to remove their ability to threaten the magician or their friends. It is equally effective against mundane weapons, implements, and shields and against [[magic items|magical]] examples - but when a magical item is broken with this spell the person who is [[create bond|bonded]] to it is unable to access any of its magical abilities.

The magical force unleashed by this spell is invisible and soundless, but irresistible. While some magicians make a point of performing massive, heroic strikes with their [[Weapons & armour#Implements|implement]], the spell is equally effective when the magician simply taps the target item while speaking the incantation to release the power. With a few words, the energy of the magician's strike is refocused and redoubled to break the object - or perhaps the magic supplements the magician's strike with the power of a Spring tempest, a Summer giant-folk, or the crumbling and inevitable decay of Winter.

Several [[magic items|crafted implements]] exist that grant additional access to this devastating magic.

## Casting

## Effects
You may call [[Calls#SHATTER|Shatter]] against the weapon, implement, or shield struck by your [[Weapons & armour#Implements|implement]].

Any weapon, implement or shield struck is broken and useless. Shattered items can be repaired with the [[mend]] spell

## Sample Spellcasting Vocals
* Let what has been made be unmade! - SHATTER!
* Cathan Canae knows my name! - SHATTER!
* (''glaring and gesturing contemptuously'') I judge you unworthy to have such a thing - SHATTER!
* (''quickly sketching the Drowned Man in the air with the other hand'') All things end! - SHATTER!
* You will be broken, as your (object) is broken - SHATTER!
* Winter warps the world! - SHATTER Suggested by Anthony White

## Common Elements
* Rune Magic: As the spell represents the ruin of crafted objects, the dangerous [[Runes|Rune]] of Storms, [[Mawrig]]. is used by many runecasters. The Rune of Might, [[Verys]], can represent irresistible strength that smashes all that stands before it, while some magicians favour [[Kyrop]], the Rune of Weakness, representing the idea that any object is only as durable as its weakest spot.
* Astronomancy: An [[astronomancy|astronomancer]] might swiftly sketch the constellation of [[the Drowned Man]] in the air before unleashing the force of this spell, or evoke the grim red eye of [[the Wanderer]] before metaphorically wrenching the target object apart.
* Dramaturgy: A [[dramaturgy|dramaturgist]] may express the precise, merciless mien of [[the Doctor]] before destroying something, or affect the whimsical and reckless nature of [[the Mountebank]] before bringing ruin down on the target.
* Other traditions: A [[Dawn|Dawnish]] witch might evoke echoing roar of the mighty [[Legendary_beasts#Chimera|chimera]], or the irresistible strength of a giant or [[ogre]] when casting this spell - while a witch of a darker mien may evoke the hateful, ruinous nature of the [[Legendary_beasts#Sphinxes_and_Manticores|manticore]]. For a [[Kallavesi]] or a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] mage, the powerful claws of the bear might prove a suitable totem to call on. A more devout magician might evoke the name of [[Inga Tarn]], while incantations referencing [[Llofir]], [[Cathan Canae]], [[Sorin]]. or even [[The Thrice-cursed Court]] are all equally appropriate.
* Realms: Destroying crafted objects has a powerful resonance with both Spring and Winter. Irresistible force that breaks through any barrier resonates with both Summer and Day - and the both Day and Winter resonate with the idea of finding weak points and exploiting them (albeit in very different ways). Night has no resonance with this spell, and the powers of Autumn are more resonant with the idea of [[mend|mending]] what magic has broken than with destroying the fruits of the crafter's skill.
