## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

### Effects

The target may ignore the effects of a single traumatic wound that is affecting them, until the end of the battle. The traumatic wound is still present, and can be healed as normal, but the target only suffers its penalties after the enchantment ends.

The target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]; all pain seems distant and dulled, and it is easy to forget that they have received a serious injury at all.

This ritual's effects last until the end of the battle, or until the traumatic wound is treated by a [[Surgical skills#Physick|physick]]

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 3. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

Despite the obvious use of this ritual in enabling brave soldiers to fight on regardless of terrible injuries, it has a dark reputation in some military circles. There have been a few grim stories of stout-hearted soldiers fighting until they utterly exhausted themselves and fell dead, not even noticing the grievous injuries they had suffered some time ago and which desperately needed the attentions of a physician. There has been at least one incident where a brutal [[The League|League]] general allegedly had the ritual cast upon rearguard units during a retreat, abandoning the seriously wounded troops in the hope of slowing down enemy pursuit. 

For the most part, though, the ritual is used to keep warriors fighting despite injuries, or to give them enough mobility to reach medical help. In some battles it is much more useful than others. An engagement that includes wights, powerful beasts or the cruel weapons of the [[Druj]] barbarians are all much more likely to result in complications for the warriors involved.

## Common Elements
The targets of this ritual are usually badly hurt when it is performed, and are the focus of the magic. Common elements include washing away blood, but may also include rubbing soil into the injured location (especially when the caster or the target is a [[The Marches|Marcher]]), drawing infection out with steel, fire or a gold coin; pinning talismans of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]], [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] or (in [[Wintermark]] especially) antler-horn to the warrior, or giving them a [[Dawn hearth magic#Favours|favour]]. [[Paragons and Exemplars]] are often invoked, especially those associated with determination and resilience, and the rune [[Jotra]], [[Verys]] or [[Rhyv]] is used to encourage fortitude and determination as are the constellations of [[The Oak]] or [[The Stallion]].
