__NOTOC__
## Overview
The Knight of the Greenwood is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a citizen of [[Dawn]]. The Greenwood Manor was [[384YE_Summer_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Greenwood_Manor|commissioned]] by Bertrand of Dawn as [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] during the Summer Solstice 384YE, with work being completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 384YE.
## Responsibilities
The Knight of the Greenwood is responsible for organising Dawnish knights to quest against the [[vallorn]] and support actions to cleanse its taint from the Empire; they are expected to support the creation of [[Knightly order|knightly orders]] dedicated to this task.
## Powers
### Treasures from the Quest
The sinecure provides six measures of [[Materials#Natural_Materials|natural materials]], and nine drams of [[herb|herbs]] each season claimed from questing against the vallorn or given as gifts by those resting at [[#Greenwood Manor|Greenwood Manor]].
SuitabilityThe Knight of the Greenwood is intended to be held by a noble: the task of organising knights against the vallorn is unsuitable for a yeofolk. If the title is held by a character who is a yeofolk, or they somehow become one during their tenure, then the player must email admin@profounddecisions.co.uk to let us know.
## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox. The Knight of the Greenwood is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[judgement]] of the Dawnish [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|Assembly]]. 

The title can be held by any Dawnish citizen. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Dawn National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
