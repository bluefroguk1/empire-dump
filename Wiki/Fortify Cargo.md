__NOTOC__
To  construct a fortification around the city of Cargo, utilising the aid offered by the Sarcophan Delves, Axos, and Jarmish in its construction.
Proposed by Morrow, Seconded by Holberg
__NOTOC__
## Overview
* This motion takes advantage of the [[The_whole_world#An_Opportunity_in_Cargo|opportunities]] offered by the diplomatic envoys from the [[Sarcophan Delves]], [[Axos]], and the [[Principalities of Jarm]].
* Passed at 200 Thrones.
## Date
* Spring 382YE
## Cost
* This fortification uses [[The_whole_world#An_Opportunity_in_Cargo|non-standard costs]]
* 80 wains of white granite, 40 wains of mithril
* 240 crowns labour costs
* 6 months to construct.

## Progress
* 40 wains of White Granite received from Thanmir Hrafnar after the Spring Equinox 382YE.
* 20 wains of Mithril and 13 Thrones received from Ariadne after the Spring Equinox 382YE.
* 24 white granite, 20 mithril, and 13 Thrones received from Edmundo of Damakan's Forge after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* 16 wains of White Granite and 32 crowns effectively provided due to the [[Sing_your_name#Securing_the_borders|Silent Sentinel]] opportunity.

## Campaign Outcome
* The time to construct this [[fortification]] has been significantly reduced by the aid of Jarmish magicians; no further reduction in time to construct is possible.
* When complete, the Axos-designed fortification will inflict half again as many casualties presuming that the Axou are free to offer their assistance to the garrison.
