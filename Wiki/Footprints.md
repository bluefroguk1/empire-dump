Oh - - - - -, wherever you go - - - -
You leave footprints in the snow - - - 

On the battlefield, midst the hue and cry - - - 
You looked death in the face and were not afraid to die - - - 

In the [[The_Labyrinth_of_Ages_and_the_Paragons_and_Exemplars|Labyrinth]], you know where to turn - - - 
Footprints that you made in life will guide your return. - - -

Oh - - - - -, wherever you go - - - -
You leave footprints in the snow - - -
