## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

This ritual is neither an [[enchantment]] nor a [[curse]], but rather is a ''shroud''. A given character can only be under the effect of one ''Secrets for the Shadow Courier'' at a time.

### Effects
This ritual requires a suitable bag or pouch no more than 18" deep or 6" wide. It targets a single character.

At the completion of the ritual the target character gains an item equivalent to a [[night pouch]] that cannot be opened by anyone save the target; the contents cannot be accessed by anyone else without ritual magic or a special ability.

The effect of the ritual lasts for a year; at the end of this time anything left in the pouch is lost in the same way as with a standard night pouch.

### Additional Magnitude
You may choose to create a more powerful effect, which is harder to penetrate or remove. You may increase the magnitude of the ritual by any amount.

### Options
If the ritualists include five measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] as part of the cost to perform the ritual, they can perform the ritual on a pouch up to 24" deep or up to 9" wide.

### Removing the Shroud
Any ritual that attempts to open the pouch or gain information about it or its contents must at least match the magnitude at which ''Secrets for the Shadow Courier'' was performed.

## Description

The [[night pouch]] spell creates a useful item, but this ritual builds on its power to create a more secure container. It is likely that this ritual represents the earliest form of night pouch, from which the existing spell was refined and specialised.

One of the main advantages it has over the night pouch spell, beyond the difficulty of opening it, is that it can be used to create a night pouch for ''anyone'', and that the pouch lasts for a full year. Another advantage, albeit a minor one, that makes the ritual appealing to others is that even the ritualists who performed ''Secrets for the Shadow Courier'' possess no special ability to open the pouch.

## Common Elements
Things that enhance themes of secrecy, concealment and privacy are common elements with this ritual. The pouch itself is often embroidered with [[Runes#Runes of Night|night runes]], especially [[Diras]].
