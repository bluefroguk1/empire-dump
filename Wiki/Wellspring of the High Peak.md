## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 This ritual targets an opaque container that contains fresh, pure water.. 

### Effects
When the ritual is performed, the ritualists put ten measures of [[ambergelt]] in an opaque container that also contains fresh, pure water. At the completion the ambergelt disappears, presented to the eternal [[Ossegrahn]].

It may take up to an hour for anything to happen, potentially longer. After this time, when the box is opened, it will contain two pieces of [[Vis#Vital Honey|vital honey]]. Each piece can be used as part of a Spring ritual as if it were up to three crystals of mana. The entire piece is consumed regardless of how much is needed, but it can be passed among multiple magicians who are contributing to the ritual if desired. 

Vital honey has no use in spellcasting, or in the rituals of other realms.

### Additional Targets
The ritual can affect additional measures in the same container. Each additional ten measures included in the ritual increases the magnitude by 4, and provides an additional two pieces of vital honey.
## Assurance
This ritual trades with the [[eternal]] Ossegrahn. If that eternal is placed under [[Amity and enmity#Enmity|enmity]] it would be illegal to perform, and there may be repercussions if the eternal feels slighted by its use. As with most rituals that [[Ritual_theory#Rituals_that_deal_with_Eternals|bind an eternal]] to respond in a certain way there is an [[Ritual_theory#Agreement|agreement]] that certain behaviour will cause it to become nonfunctional.
It loses all power if a location called the Spring of the Grey Falls in [[Morrow#Caeli|Caeli]] is ever harmed. While that region was briefly occupied by the [[Druj]], and a great deal of destruction wrought, it seems that the Spring (whatever it is) was not harmed, as the ritual continues to function.
