## Cathedral of the Navigators
This massive white granite temple of the Way dominates the skyline of the Buitenlandsewijk, an area of the Delves where foreign investment is welcomed and encouraged. Seven tower-shrines, each dedicated to one of the virtues, surround a central bastion where priests of the Way preach [[the Doctrines of the Faith]] to visiting pilgrims, and to local adherents. Each of the eight towers is topped with a dome of polished mithril that catches the light of the rising and setting sun in a way that is described as both majestic and inspiring.
