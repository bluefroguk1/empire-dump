## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
   The character must possess the [[Religious skills#Dedication|Dedication]] skill.

 
### Effects
The target gains the ability to use [[liao]] to remove an [[aura]] on a [[Aura#Personal_Aura|person]], [[Aura#Location_Aura|location]], or [[Aura#Item_Aura|item]] exactly as if they were using the [[anointing]], [[consecration]], or [[hallow|hallowing]] skill. The character can [[Religious_skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with other characters using the appropriate skill or the benefits of this enchantment to help destroy a more powerful aura following all the normal rules.  

When removing a durable aura, the enchantment allows the character to spend up to two additional doses of [[liao]] to increase the [[Religious skills#Ceremony Strength|strength]] of the ceremony by the same amount.

The ritual paradoxically creates it's own [[roleplaying effect]]; ''you become keenly aware of the importance of exercising free will without external influence.''


### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Sects|sect]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 10. Additional characters must be present throughout.
