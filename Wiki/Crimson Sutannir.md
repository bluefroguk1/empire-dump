Built in the region of [[Madruga#Torres|Torres]] in [[Madruga]], work was completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox of the same year.

## Responsibilities
The Crimson Sutannir has no particular responsibilities; they are recognised as having votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] and they receive a bounty of [[liao]] from the civil service. If the Crimson Drummers were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Sutannir to deal with those threats.

### Voice in the Synod
The Crimson Sutannir may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 14 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 14 votes if they already have a [[congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly for which [[Sinecure#Synod_Votes|they are eligible]]. 
## Appointment
The Crimson Sutannir is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[judgement]] of the Freeborn [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|Assembly]]. . 

The title can be held by any Freeborn citizen. The Sutannir has tenure and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Brass Coast National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Crimson Drummers of Madruga
On the eastern side of the Jade Range there there is clear stream that flow down from the mountains to the warm and sandy soil of Torres. Here live a group of Freeborn who cultivate alkanet; its red-maroon roots used to give colour to wines, to oils, and to varnishes.

The Crimson Drummers use this oil to care for their drums, which they use in celebration of the Way. Their celebrations involve feasting and dancing to the rhythms provided by the drummers - their hands stained bright crimson by the oils they use.
