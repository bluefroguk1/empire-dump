## Overview
The Imperial Fleet Master is an [[Imperial title]] first [[Create title of Admiral|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 378YE, then [[Amend powers of the Imperial Admiral|amended]] in Spring 380YE, with the responsibility to coordinate with [[fleet|fleet]] owners to support Imperial [[Imperial navy|navies]].

The last time the Empire had significant naval strength was during the reign of [[Emperor Barabbas]]. The majority of the ''Barabbine fleet'' was destroyed when it encountered a supernaturally intense storm two days south of Joharra. This resulted in the first, biggest – and most expensive – naval disaster of Imperial history and goes some way toward explaining why modern Imperial fleets are mercantile, rather than military, concerns. With the first launching of [[The_Brass_Coast_military_concerns#The_Freeborn_Storm|The Freeborn Storm]] just before the Winter Solstice 379YE, the Senate chose to redefine the title of 'Imperial Admiral' into the Imperial Fleet Master, opting for the title to focus on supporting navies rather than raiding barbarians. The title was further [[Amend_powers_of_Imperial_Fleet_Master|amended]] during the Summer Solstice 383YE, in part as a response to a proposal from the [[Grendel]] [[orc|orcs]] that the Fleet Master be [[Long_walk_home#Grendel|appointed ambassador to the Broken Shore]] in recognition of the Audacity, Ambition, and Cunning of then-title holder Esteban i Del Rio Blanco i Guerra. During the Autumn Equinox 384YE the Senate passed a [[384YE_Autumn_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Create_Ambassador_to_the_Grendel|motion]] creating the position of [[Ambassador to the Grendel]] which also removed the mercantile support and authority from the Fleet Master
