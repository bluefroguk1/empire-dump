## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects
At the start of the next event the target [[mine]] provides 100 rings and six ingots of additional [[materials]], in addition to the materials it would normally provide. The additional materials are always of the same type as the basic mine, regardless of any improvements.  



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional mines in the same territory. Each additional mine increases the magnitude by 10. The character who controls each mine must be present throughout the ritual.

### Limitations
This ritual is not able to affect the production of mithril, weirwood or white granite.

## Description

This ritual was first developed by the [[Urizen]], but has proved extremely popular in [[Varushka]]. It uses the magic of Summer to provide valuable benefits to the mine itself, to the workers who operate the mine, and ultimately to the owner. In parts of [[Wintermark]] there is a similar ritual called ''Build the Dragon's Hoard'', which seems particularly effective at finding rich deposits of gold.

Firstly, it keeps mine workers strong and healthy, helping them work long hours without becoming exhausted. Furthermore, accidents become less common, as pit-props are reinforced and mine tunnels themselves are simply less likely to collapse. These factors help the miners to uncover additional ingots of the precious [[Materials|materials]] that are so useful to [[Crafting skills#Artisans|artisans]]

Secondly, it helps the miners to find pockets of valuable materials - gemstones and precious metals especially. A bounty of diamonds or  sapphires, a king's ransom of mithril or silver, even a rich seam of coal or iron - all these can be sold at a handsome profit, whether directly to individuals or to representatives of the [[Imperial Bourse|bourse]]. Occasionally some wonder of the deep earth is uncovered; a cavern whose walls glitter with crystals; a black sea of fresh water that has never seen the light of day where blind white fish devour each other and are in turn devoured by larger fish; or a gallery where every movement causes echoing sounds to roll through the depths. Without this ritual, these natural splendours would never be seen by mortal eyes, and some magicians anticipate the discovery of another such delight with bated breath. 

Finally, some workers report hearing odd noises in the depths. Tunnels sometimes appear that have not been carved out by any mortal hand. Sometimes miners report hearing "songs" in the dark - deep bass voices rumbling under the earth, and barely-audible whispering on the edge of hearing. The latter is especially true when they are drawing close to a hidden pocket of valuables, as if the gold itself were singing to them. While some miners find the experience unsettling, others begin to enjoy being under ground so much that they spend more and more time in the lightless depths, sometimes just wandering the tunnels with their lanterns, as if looking for something. Perhaps it is fortunate that the ritual does not last more than a season or so.

## Common Elements
The ritual helps bring prosperity to a mine owner. Ritual performances often include the evocation of the rune [[Feresh]] or [[Tykonus]], or sometimes [[Pallas|the rune of wealth]]. Hearth magics and symbols associated with good fortune and [[Prosperity]] are also commonly evoked, such as shedding small amounts of blood or offering a cup or bowl of wine or mead to the targets - especially when this involves one or more coins or polished gemstones.
