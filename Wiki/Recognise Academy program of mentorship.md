### Overview
* Passed
 
### Date
* Spring 381YE

### Constitution
This motion was declared unconstitutional, due to there being no constitutionally mandated role for the government of the Empire in the mentorship of young people of the Empire.

OOC Note: Unfortunately it is not possible to implement a mentorship scheme in Empire because it is not compatible with our child safety guidelines.
