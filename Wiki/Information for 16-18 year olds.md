## Overview
At this age we consider young people to be full participants in the game and they will be treated, as far as possible, as adults. However, if any roleplayer believes they are the target of abusive behaviour then we encourage them to speak to one of our staff. At this age, roleplayers do not need to be accompanied to the event by a parent or carer and can automatically play a full character that can take the battlefield.

## The bar
Roleplayers who are under eighteen should be conscious of the legal restrictions placed on them. Attempting to buy alcohol on site risks damaging the entire event. Anyone caught attempting to buy alcohol on site will be refused further entry to the event until they turn eighteen.
