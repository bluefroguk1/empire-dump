## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must possess the [[Combat skills#Weapon Master|weapon master]] skill.
 

### Effects
The target of this ritual receives two benefits; they receive two additional ranks of [[Combat skills#Endurance|endurance]], and twice per day they may call [[Calls#CLEAVE|cleave]] when wielding a [[Weapons & armour#One-handed Weapons|one-handed weapon]], [[Weapons & armour#One-handed Spears|one-handed spear]], [[Weapons & armour#Great weapons|great weapon]] or [[Weapons & armour#Pole-arms|polearm]] with which they are proficient.

As long as the enchantment lasts they may respond to any effect that would make them afraid or hesitant by charging straight in, roaring or bellowing.

In addition, the target experiences a powerful [[roleplaying effect]]; they feel a strong urge to do great deeds that will make them the centre of attention, the take particular pleasure in approval and adulation. They particularly want to do things that will make them be seen as worthy, strong and powerful warriors; being overlooked or dismissed may cause them to lose their temper. 



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 18. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This ritual [[enchantment]] empowers any warrior to strike devastating blows and endure many attacks in return. it heartens them, and fills them with what many [[Wintermark]] [[Wintermark culture and customs#Art and history|scops]] call ''the heroic spirit'' - the urge to achieve and be recognised for great deeds. It is an expensive ritual to perform, but it gives quintessential strength and potence to the warrior it targets.

Some ritualists associate this to the Fields of Glory in the Summer Realm, a place of conflict and splendour overseen by the Lady [[Eleonaris]], called ''The Sovereign in Scarlet and Gold''. While that glorious and terrible monarch can grant powers very similar to this effect to her chosen, she has no direct connection to this ritual - if anything the enchantment is more strongly connected to the fields themselves, and to the concept of glory and prowess that lie at the heart of Summer.

## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching runes on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. A toast is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. The target is often garbed or [[Dawn hearth magic#Girding|girded]] in a new surcote or tabard that bears their heraldry or livery; sometimes they are symbolically crowned with a wreath of flowers, leaves or even gold. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought and triumphed against great odds, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 

Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Summer runes]] might be evoked, but [[Tykonus]], the rune of victory, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of strong and ferocious animals such as lions, bears, [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]], [[Legendary beasts#Chimera|chimerae]] and [[Legendary beasts#Dragons, Wyverns and Wyrms|dragons]]. Any number of [[eternal|eternals]] might be mentioned, especially [[Eleonaris]] or [[Cathan Canae]].
