## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must possess the [[Surgical skills#Physick|physick]] skill.


### Effects
The target of this [[enchantment]] gains the ability to use a dram of any healing [[herb]] - [[Bladeroot]], [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], [[Imperial Roseweald]], or [[Marrowort]] - as if it were a dram of [[True Vervain]] when using the [[Surgical skills#Physick|physick]] skill. This means they can use any of the five herbs with five seconds of [[appropriate roleplaying|appropriate roleplay]] to restore a target to full hits.

They also experience a roleplaying effect: you see death as the ultimate enemy whose victory must be prevented at all costs. You feel an urge to offer assistance to anyone who is on the brink of death and the idea of killing any person or animal makes you nauseous.

Note that the enchantment does not apply to other uses of True Vervain; an [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|apothecary]] could not use it to substitute another herb for True Vervain when making a [[potion]] for example.


### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 6. Additional characters must be present throughout.
