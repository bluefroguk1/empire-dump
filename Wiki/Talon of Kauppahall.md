## Overview
The motion to [[Construct_Kauppahall|construct]] Kauppahall was raised by ''Hengest Dun'', Senator for [[Hahnmark]], during the Winter Solstice 383YE, taking advantage of an opportunity [[Apples_from_a_tree#A_Troll.27s_Shadow|presented]] that season. Construction was completed shortly before the Spring Equinox 384YE but election of the title was stalled due to [[Construct_Kauppahall#Constitution|issues]] raised by the Constitutional Court. The Imperial Senate voted to [[384YE_Spring_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Amend_Talon_of_Kaupphall|amend]] the position and the first Talon of Kauppahall was elected at the same summit.

## Responsibilities

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Spring Equinox each year. The Talon of Kauppahall is appointed, through the [[Tally of the Votes]], by citizens of Wintermark who control [[military unit|military units]]. The larger the resource an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse.
