### Overview
* Attempt to create a loan to a nominated individual from the senate treasury.
* Defeated

### Date
* Spring 378YE

### Constitution
It is not possible for the Imperial Senate to act as creditor to a loan, but it may disburse funds to a senator who could then enter into a loan agreement which would be legally binding. However the Senate cannot set terms for how a disbursement must be used - nor even create a legal requirement for it to be repaid.
