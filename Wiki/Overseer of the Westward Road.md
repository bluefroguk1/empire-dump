## Overview
The Overseer of the Westbound Road is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]], and was the last of the four original components completed.

In the years since Skarsind was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the Wintermark focus was more on the routes through the passes into Hahnmark in the north-east. Over Winter 379YE, [[The_worth_of_a_life#Crossroads_of_the_North|work began]] on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with [[Bonesetter of Torfast Trading Post|Torfast Trading Post]] in [[Skarsind]] as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Karov#Delev|Delev]], the [[Northbound_Trademaster|Temeschwari guilds ]] and the [[Broker of Treji Wayhouse|Treji Wayhouse]].

In Summer 381YE, in response to an [[opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner [[Construct_a_road_connecting_the_Thule_to_the_Torfast_Trading_Post|joined]] the Northern Trade Network bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while the Empire remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the [[Temeschwar#Metri|forests of Metri]] threatened to sever [[Temeschwar]] from the network, leading to [[Don%27t_blame_me#Broken_Hospitality|instability along the trade routes]], reducing the options available to the Overseer. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the Rod and Shield were [[384YE_Winter_Solstice_Conclave_sessions#Concord:_Rod_and_Shield_and_Metri|instructed]] to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  [[Fade_out_again#A_Disturbing_Encounter|disruption]] to trade end.

Following the [[Construct Temeschwar Otkodov Mana Exchange|construction]] of the [[Keeper of the Tome|Temeschwar-Otkodov Mana Exchange]] far more traders from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead.

## Responsibilities
The Overseer is expected to keep the trade flowing along the roads that lead from Delev west into Skarsind and east to the rest of Varushka and [[Dawn]]. The close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Overseer to acquire supplies at bargain prices - metals from Skarsind and Temeschwar, and herbs from Hercynia. To a lesser degree, the Overseer can be seen as responsible for keeping an eye on trade opportunities across the northern Empire, and ensuring that Varushkan merchants are properly positioned to take advantage of them.

As a [[ministry]], the title of Overseer of the Westbound Road allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials traded from the north at a set price. The Overseer makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

Delev welcomes [[Thule]] merchants from [[Otkodov]], as well as Imperial merchants. As a consequence, the overseer has not one but ''two'' streams from which they can purchase material. The Overseer can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 17 crowns on one, and 11 measures on the other.

Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the cost to purchase crystal mana has increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the crystal mana and the ambergelt are ''both'' subject to tariffs when they cross the border with the Thule nation. The Imperial Senate [[384YE_Autumn_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Amend_Trade_with_the_Thule_II|voted]] to amend tariffs on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them [[Tariffs#Free_Trade|free trade]] which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before sanctions were imposed.

==Appointment== 
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice by Varushkans who control [[forest]] and [[mine]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the forest or mine an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a Varushkan character may hold this title, but there is no requirement for them to be from Delev (the title notionally involves encouraging trade throughout Varushka). They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse, they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
