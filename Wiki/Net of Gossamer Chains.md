## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 


### Effects
The heralds that congregate at the [[enchantment|enchanted]] [[congregation]] provide additional wealth over the next season, in addition to normal production. At the start of the next season the target congregation provides three measures of [[Vis#Warm Ashes|warm ashes]] in addition to the votes and measures of [[liao]] they would normally provide.

This ritual will not have any effect if the [[eternal]] [[Callidus]] is under [[Alignment#Enmity|enmity]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]].

 
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[congregation|congregations]] provided the congregations are all controlled by characters from the same [[Groups#Coven|coven]]. Each additional congregation increases the magnitude by 12. The character who controls each congregation must be present throughout the ritual.

### Assurance
This ritual directly invokes the power of the eternal Callidus. If he is ever under the enmity of the Conclave for four consecutive seasons the contract that forms the basis of this ritual is broken. It will no longer be possible to perform it. A new contract could be discussed to re-empower the ritual but that would require extensive negotiation.
