## Overview
Each of the eight [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|virtue assemblies]] appoints a [[Cardinal]] to represent and lead them. The Cardinal of [[Loyalty]] represents the Loyalty Assembly, and is part of what is arguably the post powerful of the Assemblies, the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]]. While they are still able to raise only a single [[judgement]] for consideration by their peers in the [[Imperial Synod]] each season, they possess a number of specific legal powers that allow them to guide and influence the Assemblies. 

The recent [[Benevolence,_inspiration,_and_legacy|Severin encyclical]] prompted a [[Without_a_plea_for_mercy|great deal of discussion]] around the role of the cardinals in the [[Imperial Synod]]. 

## Responsibilities
The Cardinal of Loyalty is assumed to provide leadership to the priests and pilgrims dedicated to that virtue. They are expected to be well versed in matters of [[Loyalty]], and of [[The Way]] in general, so that they can speak with authority on matters related to the study of Loyalty, and of [[The Doctrines of the Faith|doctrine]]. Prominent citizens who are guilty of breaking the law but believe their actions were rooted in Loyalty will often approach the Cardinal to plead [[clemency]] on their behalf, so a familiarity with the law may also prove helpful.

As a member of the Assembly of the Nine, the Cardinal of Loyalty can wield considerable influence over the politics of the Empire. In particular the Assembly has the power to [[veto]] any constitutional motion passed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. This allows the Assembly to uphold their constitutional obligation to "ensure the virtuous behaviour of the Empire".

## Powers
### Cardinal of Loyalty
The Cardinal of Loyalty has the powers common to all [[cardinal|cardinals]]: [[Cardinal#Member of the Assembly of Nine|membership]] of the Assembly of the Nine; the ability to call for [[Cardinal#Further Scrutiny|further scrutiny]] on a [[judgement]] raised in any assembly by a [[member of the Synod]] (rather than by the [[Tribune of the Synod|Tribunes]]); [[Cardinal#Appoint the Gatekeeper|appoint]] the [[gatekeeper]] of Loyalty and any other [[Imperial Title|titles]] designated as a [[Cardinal#Virtuous Appointments|virtuous appointment]] selected by the Cardinal of the Assembly of Loyalty.

### Virtue Appointments
A virtue title might be designed in such a way that it is appointed by the Cardinal alone. Currently they have the power to appoint the [[Gatekeeper]] of Loyalty, an important position that controls the distribution of [[liao#True Liao|true liao]].

### Additional Powers - The Eyes of Loyalty
The Cardinal of Loyalty may possess additional powers, not shared with their fellow cardinals, either through the action of the [[Imperial Senate]] or through [[opportunity|opportunities]] presented to them. During the Summer Solstice 383YE, in response to such an opportunity, the Assembly of Loyalty enacted a [[mandate]] restating the nature of the virtue. 

As a consequence, the cardinal gained the ability to reinforce another mandate - turning the "[[Like_a_hurricane#The_Eyes_of_Loyalty|eyes of loyalty]]" on it - using their [[judgement]] in the Loyalty Assembly. This ability initially lasted only for a year, but during the Spring Equinox 384YE, was [[384YE_Spring_Equinox_Synod_judgements#Judgement_5|made permanent]].

## Appointment
The Cardinal of Loyalty is appointed during the Autumn Equinox by the Assembly of Loyalty, and must be a member of that assembly. Selection is by a judgement of [[appointment]] raised by the Tribune in the standard manner.

The elections for the cardinals are considered to be legally equivalent positions restricted by virtue. This means that if you change your virtue assembly then you must abstain from voting in a election if it occurs less than four events after the previous election in your previous virtue assembly. If you are in any doubt about your eligibility then you should consult the Tribune, or Merlot the civil service overseer of elections who can advise you.

The judgement to appoint a cardinal will typically close at 6pm on the Saturday of the summit. These times may differ if an unscheduled appointment is required but there are always at least three hours for nominations and three hours for voting. After that time, the candidate with the most support is declared cardinal.

The Cardinal of Loyalty serves until the next scheduled election for the title. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], or by the [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|virtue assembly]] of Loyalty.
