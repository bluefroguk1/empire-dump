## Overview
The Mistress of the Dust Parador is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a citizen of [[the Brass Coast]]. Parador of Dust was commissioned by the Imperial Senate during the [[Construct Parador of Dust|Winter Solstice 383YE]] and completed shortly before the Spring Equinox 384YE.

Prior to the [[384YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_fortune#Sails_of_Fire|popular change]] prompted by the Brass Coast National Assembly, only those captains of fleets that had engaged in [[Fleet#Take_Independent_Action|privateering]] during the previous year could vote for the Mistress of the Dust Parador. This changed shortly before the Spring Equinox 384YE and now every captain of a [[fleet]] in the Brass Coast has a say in who will hold the title.

The Freeborn national assembly believe it is a prosperous act to seek out the opportunity to build a mithril exchange in Kahraman.

Following the successful [[commission]] and construction of the Cinderpath Exchange in [[Casinea]], the attention of the Freeborn turned to the rich hills of [[Kahraman#Serra_Briante|Serra Briante]] and [[Kahraman#Serra_Damata|Serra Damata]]. The peaks were already the site of both the [[Great Mine of Briante]] and the [[Damatian Cliffs]], and are dotted with smaller [[mine|mines]]. The mountains are abundant with [[Materials#Metals|precious metals]], and it is not unusual that news of a miner striking a thin vein of [[mithril]] would reach the town of Damata.

When the first rumblings around the [[Leaves_and_fruit#The_Cinderpath_Exchange|Cinderpath Exchange]] began among the [[Highguard|Highborn]], there were some in the Brass Coast who immediately saw an opportunity. The ''i Liscano'' are a small family these days, but they have illustrious roots - their ancestors were among the first trailblazers to try and settle in Kahraman. Their parador stands in a plum location in the western [[Kahraman#Jade_Range|Jade Range]] alongside one of the major roads leading down toward Segura and Madruga, perfectly positioned to encourage miners fresh from the mountains to trade their valuable ore in return not only for excellent prices but also an opportunity to rest in finely appointed surroundings. 

The designs of the [[The_Brass_Coast_leadership#Dhomiro|dhomiro]] of the Liscano family, Leticia i Liscano i Guerra, artfully weave the dual nature of such a construction, taking into account the necessity for a central storage warehouse, along with sufficiently comfortable rooms to entice traders and merchants. By leaning into, and drawing inspiration from, the almost stark nature of the warehouse, Leticia has made the surrounding [[The_Brass_Coast_economic_interests#Paradors|parador]] a thing of beauty in comparison.

The Parador of Dust allows quarry and mine owners to bring their mithril Bourse notes here and exchange them for an honest price. Those using the exchange are secure in the knowledge that not only are they enriching themselves, and receiving a just reward for their [[Prosperity]], by selling to their countryfolk they would know that the mithril would go towards supporting the Brass Coast.

In 385YE around the time of the [[appraisal]] into Kahraman, the territory faced significant [[Time_and_time_again#The_Kahraman_Problem|problems with raiders]] during which the Mistress lost access to the top two ranks of their ministry. This problem was alleviated in Summer 385YE when the Senate opted to [[385YE_Summer_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Fund_Guards_in_Kahraman|fund caravan guards]] to secure the territory.

## Responsibilities
The Mistress of the Dust Parador is responsible for using the [[mithril]] purchased from the families of [[Kahraman]] for the benefit of the Freeborn. If the Parador of Dust were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Mistress to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[opportunity]] were to arise related to the Parador, the Mistress would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
