## Overview
A handy archive of [[Empire_rules|rules]] reminders from the left bar.
## List
* Once you have gained the benefit of a [[magic items|magic item]], no-one else can use it for that day. Furthermore, you cannot gain the benefit of a different item of the same form ([[Magic_items#Weapons|Weapon]], [[Magic_items#Armour|Armour]], [[Magic_items#Talismans|Talisman]]) that day. (03/01/2024)
* When using things that grant [[Magical_skills#Gaining_additional_ranks|additional ranks]] of [[Magical_skills#Realm_Lore|realm lore]] the highest you can go is triple your original skill (so you can't have more than two extra ranks if you've only bought one rank of realm lore). (04/12/2023)
* You take damage from any [[Combat#Heroic_Blows|call]] made with a weapon or implement even if the call doesn't affect you. (12/11/2023)
* It takes at least two free hands to [[Combat#Moving_a_dying_character|move]] someone who's dead, [[Combat#Dying|dying]], Combat#Terminal|terminal]], or [[Calls#PARALYSE|paralysed]] (07/08/2023)
* You must have purchased at least one rank of a [[Magical_skills#Realm_Lore|realm lore]] skill to benefit from anything that grants [[Magical_skills#Gaining_additional_ranks|additional ranks]] in that realm. (17/07/2023)
* [[Potion#Consuming_a_Potion|Using]] a [[potion]] or [[Potion#Philtres|philtre]] takes five seconds of appropriate roleplaying, usually involving miming drinking the potion. (10/07/2023)
* When you're [[Combat#Dying|dying]] you aren't unconscious unless you want to be - you can still speak, shout, or scream for help. (07/07/2023)
* You can only be under the effect of one [[enchantment]] at a time; the most recent is the [[Enchantment#Removing_Enchantments|only one]] that applies! (03/07/2023)
* You can't use [[heroic skills#Unstoppable|Unstoppable]] if you're under the effects of a [[Calls#WEAKNESS|WEAKNESS]] or [[Calls#PARALYSE|PARALYSE]] (26/06/2023)
* You need to [[Bow_safety#Essential_Check|check your arrows]] both when you pick them up ''and'' when you put them onto the bow! (22/06/2023)
