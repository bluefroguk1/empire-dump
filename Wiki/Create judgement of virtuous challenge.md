__NOTOC__
The Senate creates the new Synod Judgement of Virtuous Challenge. A Judgement of Virtuous Challenge may be raised against a Tenured Imperial Title where a priest believes there is a citizen whose Virtues, or vision for that titled position, are superior to the incumbent's. The Assembly raising the Judgement must have oversight of that titled position. If the Judgement is upheld the position will be eligible for election at the following summit. The incumbent remains in post until that time. Any Tenured Imperial Title that has been challenged in this way may not be the subject of another such challenge until a year has passed but the title holder may still be Revoked in that time.

## Overview
* The motion proposes a new [[judgement]] available to the [[Imperial Synod]]
* Passed
## Date
* Autumn 384YE.
## Outcome
* As proposed, the new judgement would allow an [[Imperial title]] with [[tenure]] to be challenged; if the judgement was upheld then that title would be raised for election at the following summit.
* The judgement would only be raised in an assembly that was capable of [[revocation|revoking]] the title in question.
* Regardless of whether the judgement is upheld, the title could not be subject to virtuous challenge again until a year had passed, but they might still be subject to revocation

## Constitution
This new judgement was the subject of extended [[scrutiny]] by the Constitutional Court as they considered its implications and applications. After much deliberation, they determined that [[the Throne]], while it is a title with tenure, is not subject to the judgement of challenge. They also expressed some concern about the stipulation that the appointment or election of a title successfully challenged would be delayed until the following summit. In the end, they determined to keep this provision in place, but with an eye towards observing the new judgement in practice and determining if this restriction was unnecessarily disruptive.
