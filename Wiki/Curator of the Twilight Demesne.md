## Overview
The Curator of the Twilight Demesne is an [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial Orc]] [[Imperial title]] created following an [[384YE_Spring_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Construct_Twilight_Demesne|announcement]] during the Spring Equinox 384YE by Palerictus Ka'bal, [[Legion Engineer]]. The construction was completed shortly before the 384YE Summer Solstice.

## Responsibilities
The Curator of the Twilight Demesne has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Game_items#Mana_Crystals|mana crystals]] from the Twilight Demesne. If the sinecure itself were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Curator to deal with those threats  - but also to deal with any opportunity to expand the sinecure, or to make any decisions about its operation.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Curator of the Twilight Demesne has custodianship of a sinecure and receives an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
## Appointment
The Curator of the Twilight Demesne is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[senator|senator]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.

The title can be held by a Imperial Orc citizen. The Curator has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Imperial Orc [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
