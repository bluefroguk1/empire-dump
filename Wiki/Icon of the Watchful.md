## Description
An Icon of the Watchful allows a priest to perform [[Religious skills|ceremonies]] as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Vigilance]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a paragon or exemplar of Wisdom such as [[Vardas]] or [[Berechiah]]. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Varushka]] it often takes the form of a statuette of a goose, and is known as a ''Vigilant Goose'' - or occasionally a Vigilant Swan; when a visitor queries the name, pointing out the statue is obviously a goose, they are congratulated on their keen perception. In [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of the same bird, generally decorated with the [[Ophis|Rune of Revelation]], which is known as an ''Icon of the Goose'' or a ''Bright Icon''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - from the colourful illuminated scrolls recounting the lives of the exemplars popular in [[the Brass Coast]] to the delicate green crystal spindles wrapped in [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]] the [[Urizen]] call an ''Emerald Beacon''. 

The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to [[Religious_skills#Performing_a_Ceremony|perform]] ceremonies such as [[anointing]], [[consecration]], and [[hallow]], and create [[aura|auras]] of Vigilance in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to [[Religious_skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with priests dedicated to Vigilance who are not part of their [[Bands#Sects|sect]].
