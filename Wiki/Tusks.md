### Overview
The fourth Marcher Army was raised by [[Raise_Marcher_Army|Senate motion]] proposed by Henry Ward, then Senator for Upwold, during the Winter Solstice of 377YE. Mustering completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 378YE. The army of The [[Tusks]] was briefly named after [[Mournwold#Green_March|High Courage]], an ancient monument in Mournwold. This highly [[Army qualities#Disciplined|disciplined]] force saw its first major engagement when the Empire [[379YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_Mourning_Wind|launched its liberation of the Mourn]] in late Autumn 379YE.

The fourth Marcher General leads the army of The Tusks, and was initially appointed at the Summer Solstice each year. Starting in 384YE, however, the election was shifted to the Spring Equinox following [[Bills_or_bows#Resolution|the consideration of the Civil Service]].
