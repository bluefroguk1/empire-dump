This is a love song by Henry Lawes (1595 â€“ 1662), imploring the lover to stay. It is best sung accompanied if possible.

A pdf of the tune, bass line and words can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/2/23/Sweet_Stay_Awhile.pdf here]. 


Sweet, stay awhile; why do you rise?
The light you see comes from your eyes;
The day breaks not; it is my heart;
To think that I from you must part!
Oh stay, or else my joys must die
And perish in their infancy!

Oh let me die on this fair breast,
Far sweeter than the Phoenix nest;
Love, raise desire with thy sweet charms
Within the centre of her arms
And let those blissful kisses cherish
My youthful joys which else would perish!
