## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

 

### Effects
The target characters gain the ability to use [[Heroic skills#Stay With Me|stay with me]] once each day without needing to know the skill or spend any [[Heroic skills#Hero|hero points]]; however, they can only use the ability on another character who was also a target of this ritual[[#OOC Elements|*]]. 

As long as they are [[enchantment|enchanted]], the targets experience a [[roleplaying effect]]; they feel a desire to stick together, whether on the battlefield or off it. They feel a strong urge to defend the other targets of the ritual, whether from physical harm or from insults.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Band|band]]. Every two additional characters increases the magnitude by 3. Additional characters must be present throughout.

### Options


### OOC Elements
Note that the targeting restriction of this ritual this does not mean "''people who are enchanted with Circle of Gold''" it is "''people who were targets of the same Circle of Gold ritual''". The targets of a given ritual can only use the stay with me skill on other targets of the same ritual performance.

## Description

Battlefields are dangerous places, and this ritual grants an [[enchantment]] that allows members of a tight-knit band to prevent their comrades succumbing to mortal wounds easily. The dynamic of the group it is used on often influences how the enchantment is perceived - some groups use this healing as soon as one of their number is incapacitated, while others focus their attention on keeping a certain key member of the group (such as a healer, officer, magician or reckless warrior) on their feet.

Participants feel a strong urge to stick together, and tend to be very defensive of each other. It has an unfortunate side effect of encouraging groups of warriors to become embroiled in brawls and honour-duels; on more than one occasion a [[Free Company]] captain has been known to restrict his [[Bravo|bravos]] to camp after the ritual is performed to prevent them becoming engaged in a fight with other bravos and wasting the enchantment's power.

## Common Elements
As with many similar rituals, it is common for the targets to share a drink or consume food together, often with a toast or rousing cheer to mark the beginning and end of the ritual. Tokens are often given to the targets, especially tokens of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]] or those woven or painted with a group insignia. Some ritualists have any weltsilver they plan to use towards the performance of the ritual twisted into rings, one for each target of the ritual.

Many ritualists, especially [[Imperial Orcs]], [[The Marches|Marchers]] and [[Varushka|Varushkans]], encourage the participants to recite of some sort of oath of fraternity or mutual protection while joined in a literal circle, arm to arm. Images and invocations of camaraderie, [[Loyalty]] and mutual respect are common, as is the rune [[Lann]] and the constellation of [[The Chain]]. Scenes involving [[The Captain]] in various guises, often on [[The Battlefield]] are often used by [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgists]] to help create an appropraite atmosphere. The evocation of totem beasts that hunt in packs or small groups such as wolves (especially for [[The League|League]] or [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]] ritualists) are also common, especially [[Legendary beasts#Winged beasts (Pegasus)|winged beasts]],
