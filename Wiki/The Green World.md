## Description
The Green World is a powerful ritual tool attuned to the ebb and flow of the magic of the Spring realm. It is most often crafted in the shape of a wooden or bone sphere or chalice, inlaid with tempest jade, ambergelt and weltsilver. It often has an organic look, as if it were grown rather than fashioned. During rituals it takes pride of place, a strong reminder of the magical power a coven wields. When it takes the form of a bowl or chalice, it is often filled with fresh water, wine or fruit juice at the beginning of a ritual and passed from hand-to-hand as each ritualist takes a sip or adds a drop of their blood to the mix, reaffirming the bonds that connect them and the power they share as a consequence.  

Spring magic is often cruel, dangerous or destructive. A green world that has been passed down from hand to hand over a period of time (whether an artefact or through being re-enchanted) is often stained with blood, sweat or wine and becoming more asymmetrical as time goes by. It is often warm to the touch, and often seems to recognise the presence and touch of those versed in Spring magic, especially briars. Some covens make a point of placing this item in direct sunlight as often as possible, allowing it to drink in the life-giving rays in the manner of a living plant.
