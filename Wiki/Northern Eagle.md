### Overview
The soldiers of this army have long experience of fighting along the northern mountains that border the [[Thule]] lands. They contain a number of expert mountaineers, ex-prospectors and other specialists who serve as scouts, and have a significant advantage over less-experienced armies when fighting in [[Army qualities#Guerilla|mountains, forests and marshes]]. Once the [[Northern Eagle]] establishes a presence in a territory, it can prove extremely hard to dislodge.

The first Varushkan General leads the Army of the Northern Eagle, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer solstice each year.
