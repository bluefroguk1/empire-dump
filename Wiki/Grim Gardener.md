## Overview
The Grim Gardener is an [[Imperial title]] [[Construct_Gardens_of_the_Grim_III|commissioned]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 381YE. The position of Grim Gardener is a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of valuable herbs.

The garden is in the region of [[Miekarova#Perumaki|Perumaki]], [[Miekarova]], in the shadow of the imposing Vor'azi [[fortification]] of [[Miekarova#Grimhold|Grimhold]].

## Responsibilities
The Grim Gardener has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of herbs. If their garden were to be threatened in any way, however, it would be their responsibility to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any [[opportunity]] relating to the gardens presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of it.

## Powers
### Grand Bounty of Herbs
The Grim Gardener has custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. They receive a significant amount of [[herbs]] each season: 7 doses of [[True Vervain]], and 5 doses each of [[Imperial Roseweald]], [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], [[Marrowort]], and [[Bladeroot]].
## Appointment
The Grim Gardener is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.

The title can be held by a Varushkan citizen. The Gardener has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Varushkan [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## The Gardens of the Grim

The walls are covered with depictions of the Varushkan [[Varushka_religious_beliefs#The_Virtuous_Animals|virtuous animals]], and well maintained paths weave between the herb beds allowing easy access to the gardeners who protect them. 

The Garden of the Grim also contains a large statue of a strongly [[lineage|lineaged]] armoured [[draughir]] with a wolfhead helm and chains. A small plaque set into the indicates that this is the Varushkan hero [[Known_exemplars#Chernobog_of_the_Vor.E2.80.99azi|Chernobog]], an [[paragons and exemplars|exemplar]] of [[Loyalty]] who died defending the [[Imperial Conclave]] from an assault by servants of the [[eternal]] [[Arhallogen]] Spring 379YE.
