Nomination of Hector of the Spire of the Celestial Cascade to the position of Emperor.Proposed by the Conscience, seconded by Sarvos. 

### Voting
* Defeated 4 votes to 18

### Date
* Autumn 377YE (Event Three 2013). 

### Constitution
The notes record that no proxy votes were allowed for this Senate vote. This is not legal, a body may [[Proxy#Challenging_a_Proxy|challenge a proxy]] if they believe an individual is acting fraudulently, but they cannot unilaterally declare all proxy votes to be invalid, no matter how import a vote seems. Denying the right of proxy to a senator who is unable to be present is tantamount to denying representation to the Imperial citizens that that senator - or that senator's proxy - represents.
