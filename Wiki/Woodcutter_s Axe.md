## Description
Setting out to create one of these great [[Materials#Common Metals|steel or mithril]] axes can be a daunting proposition given the sheer amount of materials required to create them. Also known as a ''Sundering Axe'', their most common form is that of a great daneaxe wielded by a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] or [[Wintermark]] warrior, although they are also popular in some parts of [[The Marches|Marches]]. Woodcutterâ€™s Axes are often engraved with [[Yoorn]], the Rune of Ending or [[Kyrop]], the Rune of Weakness.

In [[the League]], there is a tradition of making these weapons in the form of heavy, thick bladed greatswords colloquially called ''Butterknives'' - a waggish reference to the way the weapons cut through steel as if it was butter. For a similar reason, some [[the Marches|Marcher]] or [[Navarr|Navarri]] warriors refer to them as ''Hotknives''. The greatsword incarnation of this weapon is often marked with the rune [[Hirmok]], representing its dominance over other tools of war.
