We propose the creation of a written history of the lives of the Egregores and their hosts. This work will be collated and maintained by Gwyliwr of the Carrion and other interested historians selected by him and will be submitted to the Imperial Archives.
''Proposed by Miaren, seconded by Hercynia.''

### Overview
* Supporting the creation of a document.
* Passed with 3 votes against.

### Date
* Spring 377YE.

### Progress
* Unknown.

### Constitution
* The Senate has not created a position with the authority, responsibility or stipend to achieve this task

The civil service opinion is that the Senate could have chosen to create an Imperial position with the responsibility to compile Egregore biographies and histories. The position could have been granted a stipend. Without the creation of an Imperial position, this motion has no legal implications.

It is important to note that no Egregore, current or past, is obligated to co-operate with this project - any more than any citizen of the Empire is required to share their history with strangers.

### Campaign Outcome
While there are no [[Research Projects|Imperial archives]] as such, reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that copies of completed histories will be made available to the people of the Empire.
