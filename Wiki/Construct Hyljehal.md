__NOTOC__
 Senate motion to build Hylje floating hall on Rikkivesi, creating the position of Mediator of the Hyljehal. To be appointed by Wintermark Senators with consideration that the Hylje ask for a Suaq Mediator in good standing. This is a highly effective mana ministry, requires weirwood, and would show our thanks to the Hylje for their assistance in the war with the Jotun.
