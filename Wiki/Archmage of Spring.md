## Overview
[[Archmage]] is an Imperial title bestowed upon a [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] by the members of the [[Imperial Conclave]]. There are six archmages; one for each of the magical realms. They serve as a focal point for [[rituals|ritualists]] of that realm, as well as helping to guide the use of the Conclave's resources. The six archmages match the six realms into which magic is divided. Where the influence of a [[grandmaster]] is primarily political, the archmages are responsible for attending to the magical business of the Conclave. They are assumed by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]], the [[Military Council]], foreign dignitaries and [[eternal|eternals]] alike to be well-versed in the capabilities and lore of their Realm. The archmages are often seen as the public faces of the Conclave; they are the individuals most likely to be consulted by other Imperial bodies when they wish to know what magical possibilities exist.

Each archmage is addressed by their title and the name of the Realm of magic they stand for - commonly in the form ''Rosmaund, Archmage of Spring'' or ''Archmage Fabiene of Spring''. The title archmage comes originally from [[Urizen]], a development of the title [[Urizen magical traditions#Magi|mage]].

## Responsibilities
The Archmage of Spring is responsible for attending to the magical business of the Conclave, and bears [[Archmage_of_Spring#Regalia_of_Spring|powerful tools]] to help them do so. They represent the Empire to the eternals of the Spring realm, and vice versa. They also work with magicians versed in the lore of [[Spring magic]] to expand the Empire's understanding and power in that realm, and employ it to the advantage of Imperial citizens.

## Powers
Each archmage position is an [[Imperial title]] in the [[Imperial Conclave|Conclave]].
### Archmage of Spring
The Archmage of Spring has the legal powers common to the Archmages. They can participate in the [[Arcane Colloquium]]; accept a formal [[Archmage#Parley|parley]] with Spring eternals; raise a [[Declaration]] of [[Alignment]] for a Spring eternal once each summit; and advise the magistrates as the recognised [[Archmage#Master_of_Magic|master of Spring magic]].


### Regalia of Spring
In common with the other Archmages, the Archmage of Spring has legal ownership of three powerful [[magic items]] that make up the [[Archmage#Regalia_of_the_Archmage|regalia of the Archmage]]. These include the [[Archmage#Staff of the Archmage|Staff of Spring]] which greatly enhances the bearer's prowess with Spring ritual magic; the [[Archmage#Chain of Aesh|Emerald Chain of Aesh]] that can reduce the magnitude of a Spring ritual; and the [[Archmage#Belt of Stars|Belt of the Fountain]] which can allow multiple [[coven|covens]] from the same nation to cooperate in the performance of a single Spring ritual.

## Appointment
The appointment, replacement, or removal of the Archmage of Spring is made by [[Declaration]] of [[candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. A candidate can be presented for the post of archmage only once a season, and the title can be held by any Imperial citizen.

The Archmage of Spring serves until they are replaced by another magician using the Declaration of Candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, an archmage cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]].

## The Eternals of Spring
The Archmage of Spring is the Empire's formal representative to the inhabitants of the Spring realm, and often serves as a go-between when those eternals wish to communicate with the Empire. Most eternals will treat the archmage as a peer - although that can mean very different things for different eternals. One of the most potent abilities the Archmage of Spring possesses is the power of [[Archmage#Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiary]], allowing them to communicate with eternals from their realm and potentially arranging a [[Archmage#Parley|parley]]. A list of previous plenipotentiary results can be found [[:Category:Plenipotentiary|here]]

Of all the Archmages, the Archmage of Spring may be said to have the most difficult job when dealing with the eternals of the Spring realm. More than any other realm, the concerns and attitudes of the Spring eternals are often alien to mortal sensibilities, and tend to be at odds with the requirements of a civilised nation.

The Archmage of Spring is often in a good position to present declarations of [[amity and enmity]] to the Imperial conclave when relations between the Empire and an eternal need to be formalised. Indeed, more than any other [[Imperial title]], the Archmage benefits from cultivating an awareness of the relationships between the inhabitants of the Spring Realm and Imperial citizens. The current status of the Spring eternals with an interest in the Empire can be found [[Amity_and_enmity#Spring|here]].
