## Overview
The Tolvoli Butcher was created when the Imperial Senate voted to [[385YE_Summer_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Construct_Tolvoli_Slaughterhouse|construct the Tolvoli Slaughterhouse]]. during the Summer Solstice 385YE, following an [[opportunity]] presented [[The_horror_and_the_wild#Heart_of_the_Tempest|that season]]. Construction was completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 385YE.

## Responsibilities
The Tolvoli Butcher is responsible for ensuring that the dubik near Tolvoli do not become a problem. If the slaughterhouse were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Butcher to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[opportunity]] were to arise related to the slaughterhouse, the Butcher would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.

### The Red Harvest
As a [[ministry]], the Tolvoli Butcher can exchange animal blood for unique consumables at a set price. The Tolvoli Butcher spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

The grove near Tolvoli produces three different types of elixir depending on the quality and quantity of the blood provided. ''Bloodvine Liquor'' is a sweet, thick, gloopy substance that provides additional power to a magician working [[Spring magic]], provided they spill copious amounts of their own blood in the casting. A ''Blackblood Thorn'' is razor-sharp and must be thrust into the skin when performing [[Winter magic]] to provide a burst of additional power, but leaves a stinging wound that may take some time to heal completely. ''Darkwine'' is a euphemistic name for a bitter alcoholic infusion that looks like blood and smells of honey, and grants vigorous health for a time. All three are tonics.
## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. The Tolvoli Butcher is appointed by citizens of Varushka who control [[mine|mines]] and [[forest|forests]] [[Resource#Personal_Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the resource an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a Varushkan citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
