## Overview
The Prelate of the Little Mother is an Imperial title which was originally created in 15YE. The position of Prelate is a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of [[liao]], and additional votes in the [[Imperial Synod]].

## Responsibilities
The Prelate oversees [[#Basilica of the Little Mother|the Basilica of the Little Mother]] in [[Bastion]] that houses the [[inspirational location|tomb]] of the [[the Little Mother|exemplar]] of [[Prosperity]]. If the basilica or the tomb were to be threatened, it would be the responsibility of the Prelate to face those threats; likewise should any [[opportunity]] related to the shrine arise they would decide how to respond.


## Appointment
The Prelate is a [[New_Imperial_titles#The_Imperial_Synod|virtue position]] which is [[Appointment|appointed]] by [[judgement]] of the [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|Prosperity assembly]]. 

The Prelate has [[tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Assembly of Prosperity, and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Basilica of the Little Mother
Built in 15YE by the Custodes Clavium, with extensive investment from League citizens and priests, this beautiful structure of [[white granite]] served as a place of pilgrimage for nearly four centuries. Like other churches of the Little Mother, it operated as an orphanage - the largest outside of Sarvos. In the lead up to [[Three_celebrations_and_a_funeral#Tragedy_of_the_Little_Mother|Winter Solstice 383YE]] it was the site of a terrible accident that left the the structure gutted, reduced to little more than a smoking shell. 

Though the Imperial Senate did pass a [[Repair the Basilica of the Little Mother|motion]] to repair the basilica, which would see the Prelate receive their full complement of liao and votes, it has still not been completed as of the Winter Solstice 384YE.
