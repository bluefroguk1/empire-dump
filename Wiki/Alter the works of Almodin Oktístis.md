* How this motion interacts with the Synod Mandate 14: the Synod-inspired mobs tore out the idolatrous statues and other decorations and repurposed them in a way intended to send a clear message to the Asaveans that their idolatry would not be tolerated. Then the Senate-employed craftspeople repaired the damage. You can read about this in more detail [[383YE_Summer_Solstice_winds_of_fortune#Wrecking_Ball|here]].
