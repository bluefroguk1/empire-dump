## Description
A Trollhammer is a massive [[Weapons & Armour#Two-handed weapon|two-handed weapon]], usually a mace or hammer, that strikes with such concussive force that it temporarily stuns the target.

A common misconception about this weapon is that it is named a ''Trollhammer'' because it is a weapon used to kill trolls. While this may be the case, the fact of the matter is that the early [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]] [[Wintermark history|first encountered]] these weapons in the hands of the trolls, and only used them against them at the point where they took them away from their previous owners... Fully grown trolls can wield such a hammer in only one hand. Stories of the final battles tell of troll champions who used these weapons to devastating effect, crushing all who came before them until eventually they were overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. Legend states that the dying trolls called down a curse upon the weapons their enemies had stolen from them - several of which were true [[Magic_items#Artefacts|artefacts]] - although these are surely fanciful accounts embroidered by [[Wintermark culture and customs#Art and history|scops]] to make better sagas. Still, anyone discovering a truly ancient Trollhammer is wise to treat the weapon with caution until it is clear whether it is safe to wield in battle or not.
