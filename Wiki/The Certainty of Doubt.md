## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 At the end of the ritual one of the [[Rituals#Contributors|contributors]] is chosen to deliver the curse with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]].



### Effects
This ritual creates a [[curse]] that is delivered to a target with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]]: one [[Rituals#Contributors|contributor]] is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 

While under the curse, the target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]; you often stumble over your words; the more people who are listening to you or the more authoritative you are being about a subject the harder it is to express yourself clearly.

If the target leads a [[congregation]] it will quickly shrink as a consequence. During the next downtime period and for as long as the curse persists the congregation provides only half the [[Congregation#Production|liao and votes in the Synod]] it would normally provide.



### Removing the Curse
The curse can be alleviated by certain powerful creatures or items.
