## Description
As with other [[:Category:Icons|icons]], this ceremonial tool allows a priest to perform a [[Liao]] ceremony. Also known as an ''Icon of the Hearth'', these icons often bear images of paragons and exemplars closely associated with the home, with defending places or with hospitality but in truth it is difficult to make definitive statements about their appearance beyond the fact that they tend to be significant religious items wielded during a ceremony.

It can take months for a skilled [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] to create an Icon of the Steward. The materials used often include small amounts of magical [[Materials|materials]], and it is very common for a crafter to use tools inlaid with [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] when working on an icon. It is also quite common for an Icon of the Steward to be beautifully inlaid with precious metals and stones, and for it to be left in pride-of-place in a shrine when not in use. In many devout homes, an Icon of the Steward is the first ornament seen when one enters through the main door, even if the home itself is not consecrated to one of the [[The_Doctrines_of_the_Faith#The_Doctrine_of_Seven|virtues]].

## Rules

* Effect: While you are wielding this icon you can perform the [[Religious skills#Consecrate|consecrate]] ceremony as if you knew it.
* Materials: Crafting an Icon of the Steward requires no special materials. It takes two months to make one of these items.
