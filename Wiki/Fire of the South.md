### Overview
The soldiers of this army are trained in tactics appropriate to flat, open land. Often recognised by their brightly polished armour, their warriors and supply lines are trained to be especially mobile and responsive to attacks from any direction. This gives them a marked advantage over less adaptive armies, allowing them to [[Army qualities#Fast|cover great distances very quickly]].

The second Brass Coast General leads the Fire of the South, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Autumn equinox each year.

## Army Quality : Fast
The Fire of the South is able to move quickly over long distances. This is not just a quality of speed - moving thousands of soldiers overland is a daunting logistical prospect. Within the Empire, the army takes advantage of the [[trods]] whenever it can, supplementing their magical endurance with forced marches and expertly organised baggage trains.
