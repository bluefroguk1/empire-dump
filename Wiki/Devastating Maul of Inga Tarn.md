## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

 

### Effects
The enchantment grants the target the ability to spend a [[Heroic skills#Hero|hero point]] to call [[Calls#SHATTER|SHATTER]] with a [[Weapons & armour#Great_weapons|great weapon]].

They also experience a [[roleplaying effect]]: You feel an urge to protect those who cannot defend themselves by confronting anything that threatens them.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 15. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This ritual is named for the [[Paragons and Exemplars|exemplar]] of [[Courage]] [[Inga Tarn]], whose miraculous strength and unquenchable spirit serve as an inspiration throughout the Empire. It allows an individual to shatter the shields and weapons of their opponents, leaving them vulnerable or impotent. It is most effective when used on someone who already possesses a reserve of [[Heroic skills#Hero|inner strength]], but might be useful to the wearer of a suit of [[Runeplate]] and it clearly valuable to the wielder of a [[Trollslayer's Crescent]]. If the chosen target has access to a stock of [[Philtres of War]], they can get even more use out of the power this enchantment grants.

Other versions of this ritual exist; ''The Ruinous Blade'' is a similar ritual that is often used with greatswords or two-handed axes, while ''The Trollcrusher's Mattock'' is an old name for the ritual attributed to the [[Steinr]] [[Wintermark magical traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]] or [[Hahnmark]].

## Common Elements
This ritual often involves symbols of [[Courage]], and invocations of physically powerful creatures such as bears, [[Legendary beasts#Gryphons|gryphons]] or [[Legendary beasts#Dragons, Wyverns and Wyrms|dragons]]. Sometimes riven shields are used as a component, and the target may be encouraged to undertake a symbolic act of destruction as part of the performance such as breaking a board with fist or foot.

[[Verys]], the run of might is commonly used with this ritual, either drawn on the arms of the target or on their two-handed weapon.
