Em
Marcher lasses, Marcher lads,
Em ______________________ A
Leave your homes and leave your farms
Em
Beat your ploughshares into swords
Em ____________ Bm___Em
The time has come to take up arms

''Repeat''

Chorus:
A
Come along and join with me
A __________________ Em
Hear the horns the Beaters blow
Em
Our foes will fall before the scythe
Em______________ Bm___Em
From earth we come, to earth we go

Join me marching ever on
With your billhook in your hand
Feel the ground begin to shake
When Marchers fight for Marcher land

''Repeat''

Chorus

We are stout and we are strong
Marcher folk will never yield
We shall never be afraid
With Virtue as our shining shield

''Repeat''

Chorus

Those that stand before us now
They shall reap just as they sow
Their bodies will enrich our soil
Their blood will make the barley grow

''Repeat''

Chorus
