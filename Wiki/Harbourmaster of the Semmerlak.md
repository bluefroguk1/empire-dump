## Overview
The [[Karov#Korotny|docks of Korotny]] were expanded by an [[384YE_Spring_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Expand_the_Docks_at_Korotny|announcement]] from Pavel Novak, [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]]. during the Spring Equinox 384YE, following an [[opportunity]] presented during the [[Apples_from_a_tree#A_Ripple_On_the_Lake|Winter Equinox]] of 383YE. Construction was completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 384YE.  

The amount of ilium available to purchase was reduced following the [[Underwater_sunshine#Dho.27uala.27s_Tithe_-_Ports|rise of the sovereign]] [[Dho'uala]] which saw shipping on the Semmerlak significantly impacted, and ultimately [[The_horror_and_the_wild#Taking_From_the_Depths|dropped to nothing]] following a change in the law during the Summer Solstice 385YE.
## Responsibilities
The Harbourmaster of the Semmerlak is responsible for ensuring good relations with those who offer their weirwood and ilium for trade. If the docks of Korotny were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Harbourmaster to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[opportunity]] were to arise related to the docks, the Harbourmaster would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.

### Ministry
As a [[ministry]], the Harbourmaster can purchase quantities of [[weirwood]] at a set price. The Harbourmaster spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed. When first created, the docks also allowed the Harbourmaster to purchase [[ilium]] dredged from the depths of the Semmerlak. A Summer 385YE [[Senate motion]] [[385YE_Summer_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Create_law_criminalising_Semmerlak_items|changed the law]] to make it [[The_horror_and_the_wild#Taking_From_the_Depths|illegal to take things from the lake]] in an attempt to placate the [[Varushkan_Monster#Sovereigns|sovereign]] [[Dho'uala]], removing this opportunity..

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice each year. The Harbourmaster of the Semmerlak is appointed by citizens of Varushka who control [[mine|mines]] and [[forest|forests]] [[Resource#Personal_Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the holder an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a Varushkan citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## Docks at Korotny
Of all the nations in the Empire, Varushka is by far the richest in terms of natural resources with deep seams of valuable metals and vast forests of high quality timber. The bustling port of Korotny, situated in the east of [[Karov]], lies on the north-western shores of [[the Semmerlak]], where it benefits from substantial trade with [[Dawn]] and [[Holberg]]. For a long time, only the ever present threat of the [[Thule]] held its ambitions in check. 

The local [[boyar|boyars]] waited with interest to see how the Dawnish would respond to [[Great_prosperity_and_strength#Applefell_and_Lacre|an opportunity to build the Star Metal Market]] in Lacre. These wealthy Varushkans had grown rich from the lake-trade and welcomed the prospect of new markets opening up but they were also quick to seize the chance when the Dawnish opted not to pursue the market themselves. Under the leadership of ''Oksana Lyava Pinavora'', they swiftly they put forward an alternative plan that lead to the docks [[Expand the Docks at Korotny|being expanded]] in Spring 384YE.

The old docks were expanded and modernized, and new warehouses were built. In addition to creating a place for Varushkan woodcutters, and for lumberjacks from [[Weirwater]] to sell their [[weirwood]], the docks became the natural place to sell any ilium found in the Semmerlak.
