## Overview
The Imperial Master of Works is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]]. The title was [[Create_title_of_Imperial_Master_of_Works|created]] at the Autumn Equinox summit of 377YE. The title has been amended several times since its creation. At the Spring Equinox 378YE, the Senate voted to [[Amend_powers_of_Imperial_Master_of_Works|remove]] the Master of Works' ability to create new [[fortification|fortifications]]. They also removed a 10 Throne [[New_Imperial_titles#Stipend|stipend]] the title had initially enjoyed. The Imperial Master of Works has further [[Amend_powers_of_the_Imperial_Master_of_Works|amended]] in Spring 380YE; it was limited to a single [[commission]] each season in line with other similar titles.

==Responsibilities== 
The Master of Works is responsible for overseeing the maintenance and improvement of [[fortifications]] on behalf of the Senate. When first created, the Master of Works had the ability to [[Fortifications#Creating_a_fortification|commission]] new fortifications, but that power was removed by the Imperial Senate in Spring 378YE.
## Powers
### Maintain Fortifications
The Master of Works can  [[Fortifications#Repairing_a_fortification|repair]] fortifications. The materials required to repair the fortification are provided by the Master of Works. 

To use this power, the Master of Works provides an [[Senate_announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Master of Works. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[veto]] over the Master's decision.

### Improve Fortifications
The Master of Works can [[Fortifications#Improvement|improve]] an existing fortification. The materials required to improve the new fortification are provided by the Master of Works. 

To use this power, the Master of Works provides an [[Senate_announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Master of Works. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[veto]] over the Master's decision.

When the title was created, this power was unlimited. In Spring 380YE the Senate chose to [[Amend powers of the Imperial Master of Works|amend]] this power in response to an administrative motion.
## Appointment
The Master of Works is [[New_Imperial_titles#The_Imperial_Military_Council|appointed by the Military Council]].

Appointments by the Military Council are traditionally carried out with a show of hands at a [[Council session]]. Any Imperial Citizen may hold this title.

The Imperial Master serves for a year, and they can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]] and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
