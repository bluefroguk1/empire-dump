### Overview

### Campaign Outcome
* The House of Barbs is now complete

* After a false start earlier in the year, the Senate commissioned an [[Construct_extension_to_House_of_Barbs|extension]] to the House of Barbs in Summer 382YE that increase the amount of liao and votes provided by the sinecure.

### Constitution
* Sinecures are normally life-time appointments. 
* The title "[[Voice of Barbs]]" provides votes in the Imperial Synod, and so grants the holder of that title the legal powers and responsibilities of membership of the Synod. If the holder of the title is not already a member of the Synod, it automatically includes membership of all appropriate assemblies (usually the General Assembly, the Assembly of the Way, and the appropriate National Assembly). 
* In future, any Senator submitting a motion of equivalent length or verbosity will be advised to revise it before the motion will be accepted by a speaker.
