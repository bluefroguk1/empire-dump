__NOTOC__
## Overview
The Wisdom of the Tenebrous Path is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a citizen of [[Navarr]] [[Construct_the_Tenebrous_Path|created by the Senate]] in Winter 383YE. The position of Wisdom is a [[sinecure]], producing [[Game_items#Mana_Crystals|mana crystals]] each season.

## Responsibilities
The Wisdom of the Tenebrous Path has no particular responsibilities, they simply receive an income of valuable mana crystals each season. If the sinecure were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Wisdom to deal with those threats. 
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Wisdom of the Tenebrous Path has custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. They receive an income of 9 mana crystals each season.

## Appointment
The Wisdom of the Tenebrous Path is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. It is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Navarr]] [[general|generals]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Military Council]] instead.

The title can be held by any Navarr citizen. The Wisdom serves until the next scheduled election. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Navarr [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## The Tenebrous Path
The Tenebrous Path is made up of eight small halls clustered in a glade of young oak trees.  The main hall is larger than the others and primarily serves to welcome and introduce new visitors. At one end of the hall there is a statue of a [[changeling]] with a small plaque bearing the following "''Our oaths are our choice, given freely to walk the shadowed road to whatever end. Let your oath stand testimony to all that you are. A thorn once, always, until the very end.''" Each of the other halls serve as an academy dedicated to the study and understanding of warfare, with experienced [[thorn|thorns]] and [[Navarr_magical_traditions#Vates|vates]] on hand to offer advice and guidance. 

The mana crystals that form in the [[mithril]] bowls of the Tenebrous Path are noted for their rich crimson colouration, which some [[Navarr_religious_beliefs|guides]] suggest should serve as a reminder for the cost of blood in war.
