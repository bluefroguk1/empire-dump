__NOTOC__
To create the Imperial title of Dean of the Thorned Rose. A place of learning to be build just outside of Seren, in Miaren. This will be a place to teach prospective vates. To explain what it means to swear the oath and to help those that wish to learn of magic and the realms in how to proceed. This will function as a mana sinecure. The Dean will be appointed by the Navarr Senators, and will have tenure. The Dean will be expected to swear the following oath: “Never to sway from the path of the Vate: this I swear. Take in the willing, share my life’s Wisdom: this I swear. Train them in all they need to know, prepare them for the Oath: this I swear. Never to accept the Vate Oath of the irresponsible, reckless, or unworthy: this I swear.''Imperial Wayleave by Silvio di Tassato''
