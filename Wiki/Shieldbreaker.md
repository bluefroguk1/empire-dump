## Description
A Shieldbreaker is often a one-handed axe, hammer or mace. It is especially favoured by the [[Steinr]], who use it to great effect when fighting the well-armoured [[orc|orcs]] that infest the lands to the west of the Empire. Many [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] take pride in proving the superiority of their craft over that of the barbarians, showing that anything the orcs could create could be broken by their arts.

Swift and lightly armoured skirmishers among the [[Navarr]], [[the Marches|Marcher]] [[The_Marches_military_concerns#beaters|beaters]], and [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[unconquered]] make use of these weapons to even up the odds against shield-bearing opponents and to soften such foes up for their comrades in the main battle-line. Hammers and axes are the most common forms among these groups, who sometimes call them ''Bullâ€™s Eye Bait'' as skilful use of these weapons will open up the target for a deadly shot from allied archers.

[[Wintermark magical traditions#Runesmiths|Runesmiths]] often inscribe the rune [[Verys]], Rune of Might, on a Shieldbreaker. Although some smiths prefer to use [[Mawrig]], the Rune of Storms, weapons bearing this mark are often considered to draw their wearers into dangerous situations; they are used by the [[Wintermark religious beliefs#Frayed|frayed]] but many others prefer to avoid them. This weapon is popular with many orcs, both the [[Imperial Orcs]] (especially their [[Imperial_Orcs_economic_interests#Reavers|reavers]]), and [[barbarian|barbarians]].
