## Description
The Icewalker's Anvil is a useful talisman useful to the ritual magicians of [[Wintermark]]. The [[Magic_items#Schema|schema]] was purchased from the eternal [[Estavus]] as part of [[Inkpot_gods#The_Mediators_Bargain|her offer]] to the mediators of Wintermark. Originally known as the ''Dripping Ring'' the focus was renamed by the [[Suaq]] Ã†thwin who passed the schema to [[Wintermark_Egregore#Sulkavaris|Sulkavaris]] to be added to Runesmith's Law.

## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you can use one personal mana as if it were crystal mana when casting a ritual.
* Materials: Crafting the Icewalker's Anvil requires four ingots of [[tempest jade]] and three measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
