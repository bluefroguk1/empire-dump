### Constitution
The Imperial Senate has given the Assembly of Loyalty the ability to [[Revocation|revoke]] the Captain of the Senate Guard. The Constitutional Scholars point out that this is in ''addition'' to the ability of the Assembly of Nine and the General Assembly to revoke the title. The Senate can give additional assemblies the power to revoke a title, but they cannot create a title in such a way that they remove the ability of an assembly to revoke it.
