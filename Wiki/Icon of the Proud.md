## Description
The ''Icon of the Proud'' is, paradoxically, rarely actually called an Icon of the Proud. Rather, every bearer tends to refer to it by a name that has personal meaning for themselves and their people. In [[Dawn]], unsurprisingly, it is an ''Icon of the [[Glory|Glorious]]''. In [[Wintermark]] an ''Icon of the [[heroism|Hero]]''; in [[Urizen]] an ''Icon of [[Arete|Excellence]]'', in [[the Brass Coast]] an ''Icon of [[Honesty|Glass]]''. It might be an ''[[Highguard|Icon of the Resolute]]'' or ''Faithful'', an ''[[Navarr|Icon of Sacrifice]]'', or an ''[[the Marches|Icon of the Calloused Hand]]''. And these are just the common names that reflect pride in a nation, rather than the myriad other names that represent more personal pride.

It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a paragon or exemplar of Pride such as [[Empress_Richilde|Richilde]]. Usually, the image is of a figure that the bearer personally finds inspiring and this may mean that it contains the likeness of someone who is not ''technically'' a paragon or exemplar. Some [[the League|League]] priests bear a particular ''Icon of the Clever'' that bears the image of [[Emperor Giovanni]] for example, inspired by his practical politics. The Icon is not always a portrait either - even more so that other icons it is common for an Icon of the Proud to take the form of a piece of art particular to a given nation. In [[Varushka]] for example, it often takes the form of a statuette of an eagle, and is known as a ''Proud Eagle'' or occasionally (and a little paradoxically) a ''Wise Eagle''.

The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to [[Religious_skills#Performing_a_Ceremony|perform]] ceremonies such as [[anointing]], [[consecration]], and [[hallow]], and create [[aura|auras]] of Pride in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to [[Religious_skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with priests dedicated to Pride who are not part of their [[Bands#Sects|sect]].

## Rules

* Effect: You may perform ceremonial skills other than [[dedication]] as if you were dedicated to the virtue of [[Pride]].
* Materials: Crafting an Icon of the Proud requires 5 measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], 7 ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], and 9 measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]; It takes 1 month to make one of these items.
