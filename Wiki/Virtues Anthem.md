To the tune of [http://www.madrigirls.org.uk/audio/veni.mp3 Veni Veni Emmanuel]. Lyrics by Jude Reid.

RECORDING of this song: [[Media:virtues-anthem.mp3]]


O come o come ye seven virtues bright
And lead this soul from darkness into light
Let courage be my armour and my shield
With virtue as my guide I shall not yield
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''

O let my spirit hear ambition's call
To strive and rise and never fear to fall
Let flames of holy fervour fill my soul
I shall not cease until I reach my goal
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''

I pray that every day my wisdom grow
That I in turn may teach on what I know
To know the truths of all the world I yearn-
Till my last breath I shall not cease to learn
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''

Oh holy virtue grant that I be proud 
To own my sins and speak my virtues loud
No falsehoods vile, false modesty or shame
Shall tarnish the bright glory of my name
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''

All ills I will ensure for duty's sake
A valiant heart may cease but never break
To kinsman, to lover, and to friend
My loyalty shall be without an end 
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''

With vigilance I strive that I perceive
Those liars who dissemble and deceive
May sinners fear my name across the land
May traitors perish weeping at my hand
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''

When hard I work with hand and heart and mind
Prosperity shall follow close behind
I shall make use of every throne I earn
That other men shall prosperous be in turn
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
