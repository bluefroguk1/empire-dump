* Lyrics by Chris Clarke
* To the the tune of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_aM4Ar73j0| Sospan Fach] (Traditional Welsh)
* [https://soundcloud.com/christopher-clarke-580791164/at-night-you-can-hear-them-screaming-barbarian-music-for-druj?fbclid=IwAR2_pY5KX01Dhc4pHKCVE-tFEJbEbhFfucDyvECJRsTGpXxA_IoljI4Dhlc| At night you can hear them screaming] on Soundcloud, performed by Chris Clarke


At night you can hear them screaming
The unlucky ones who have survived
You can still see the last village blazing
Your next now the Druj have arrived!

You can run, but we will always catch you
You can hide, but we will find you soon
Now's when the empire meets its doom

Sometimes the foe begs for mercy
But I do not know what that means
Flee leave your comrades behind you
Our lullabies will be their screams

You can run....

So the next time that you cross that bridge
Know that you better be afraid
Your suffering's what we delight in 
But soon we will put you in your grave

You can run....
