This is an arrangement of G.F. Handel's Air from the Water Music Suite No. 1. It has been arranged for three recorders (two descants and a tenor) but can be played by any instruments in C. There is a version of the bass line in both treble and bass clef, so you only need to play one of the bottom two lines. There is also chords above the music, but these are less desirable and should be omitted if two or three of the parts are available. 

The pdf of this arrangement can be found [[http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/f/f3/Wedding_Air.pdf here]]. 

You can listen to it on YouTube [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-rhoxQTLS4 here]].
