## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects
This ritual has three related effects:
* When hits are restored to the target by any means then they are also cured of the [[Calls#VENOM|VENOM]] status if they were affected. This effect will not work if the [[purify]] spell would fail to remove the VENOM effect for any reason.
* The target is not subject to the venomous effects of the [[Vallorn#Vallorn_Miasma|vallorn miasma]]. They will not contract [[Vallornspawn_husk#Green_Lung|green lung]], nor will they become a [[Vallornspawn_husk|vallornspawn husk]] if they die while under this enchantment. 
* The target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]: they feel healthy, vital and full of energy. They also have a greatly increased appetite, feeling the need for significantly more food and drink than they might normally require.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters who are part of the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 11. Additional characters must be present throughout the ritual.

### Option
Any caster who has mastered the ritual may choose to substitute [[Imperial Roseweald]] for crystal mana when contributing to it. Every 2 doses spent counts as 1 crystal mana when contributing to the ritual.

## Description
The supernatural vitality offered by this ritual helps survive exposure to supernatural [[Calls#Venom|venom]], especially the effects of close exposure to the [[vallorn]] and its creations. It is a powerful protection when facing enemies who employ tactics that make extensive use of venom, such as the [[Druj]] or the [[Navarr]], or creatures whose presence or attacks can be dangerously toxic such as [[Legendary beasts#Hydra|hydras]] or [[plaguewulf|plaguewulfs]]. 

The ritual strengthens the life of the target, such that almost ''any'' medical attention will purge the effects of venom. This greatly improves the likelihood of exposure to life-threatening poisons and venom - a [[Surgical skills#Chirurgeon|chirurgeon]] can quickly remove the effect of exposure to a Druj knife, for example, or a single dose of [[True Vervain]] not only restore the victim of a plaguewulf to full fighting strength but also remove the threat of undying servitude should the patient fall to the creature's claws. Rather than needing to exhaust their entire reserve of personal power, a [[Dawn_magical_traditions#War_witches|war witch]] can [[Spellcasting#Swift_casting|swiftly]] cast a [[heal]] spell on their enchanted ally, having the dual effect of restoring health and purging venom. A bold Navarr [[thorn]] can rise, [[Heroic skills#Unstoppable|unstoppable]], from the ground while fighting a venomous beast not only restored to health but purged of life-threatening venom.

The ritual is not a panacea - it is sufficiently difficult that it is not a simple matter to provide it to every warrior on a battlefield - but when coupled with other protections it can greatly increase the likelihood of surviving a battle, not least because it allows existing supplies for treating poison to be spread less thinly. Those protected with the Vitality of Rushing Water can rely on more straightforward healing methods.

In some circles this ritual is called ''The Mark of Abraxus'', after the [[Abraxus Stone]]. In [[Dawn]] it is sometimes referred to as the ''Breath of the Hydra'', while those [[Highguard|Highborn]] who have used it in skirmishes with the hated Druj call it ''Strength of Pure Water''.

## Common Elements
As with many enchantments, ritualists often mark the targets of the ritual in some way. Common elements include shared consumption of a drink or herbal preparation; painting a rune or symbol on the face or chest of the target; or securing a woven [[Dawn hearth magic#Favours|woven favour]], braid or protective amulet to the target. Branches or leaves from hardy plants or those associated with good health, such as the oak, ivy or mistletoe, are sometimes woven together and worn on the head or wrists or in the hair; amber or even [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] jewelry might also be used to signify the protection offered by the ritual.

The idea of washing or purifying is another element that works well with this ritual. Fresh and salt water alike have resonance with a ritual designed to offer protection from dangerous impurities. Some ritualists perform a ceremonial washing of hands, while more vigorous rituals might involve pouring water over the head of the targets. With [[blood magic]], it is not uncommon for a small amount of blood donated by a child to be mixed with water and used to anoint the targets.

Evocations of runes such as [[Bravash]], [[Rhyv]], [[Feresh]] or [[Cavul]] are all common, as is the constellation of [[The Fountain]]; a scene involving [[The Doctor]] or [[The Witch]]; or the strength and vitality of potent creatures such as [[Legendary beasts#Hydra|hydras]], boars or bears.
