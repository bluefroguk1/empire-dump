You can either sing each verse in order, or repeat the first verse between each subsequent one for a longer performance.

Original melody and words by Brian Tollady.

Listen to Brian's rendition [https://youtu.be/BKCi7_DvSyg here].


Fear and panic grips our foe,
They don’t know how this fight will go,
By sharpened blade and armoured might,
There'll be none left come fall of night,
There'll be none left come fall of night,

We've been at war since long way back,
An orcish life is tough like that,
But come the day we're home once more,
We'll dance and sing and drink for sure,
We'll dance and sing and drink for sure,

The sound of battle we adore,
Orcish soldiers live for war,
We'll fight our foes 'til none left stood,
With weapon and armour drenched in blood,
With weapon and armour drenched in blood,

So round the fire are legends told,
Of orcish warriors brave and bold,
Their voice lives on, their foes lie dead,
A legend forged by much bloodshed,
A legend forged by much bloodshed,

Fear and panic grips our foe,
They don’t know how this fight will go,
By sharpened blade and armoured might,
There'll be none left come fall of night,
There'll be none left come fall of night.
