__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Construct_House_of_Guerra|motion]] to construct the House of Guerra was raised by the Senator of [[Madruga]] during the Summer Solstice 383YE. The House of Guerra is built near to the [[Zemress#The_Seminary_of_Zemress|Seminary of Zemress]] in [[Madruga#Calvos|Calvos]], Madruga and work was completed shortly before the Winter Solstice 383YE.

## Responsibilities
The Hand of Guerra is responsible for helping refugees adjust to new lives in the Empire, as well as for spreading the philosophy of [[Guerra]] to the Empire - and indeed the world.
## Powers
### Sincure
As a [[sinecure]], the title of Hand of Guerra receives 12 liao each season, to help them minister to the needs of those who attend the House.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice. The Hand of Guerra is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[judgement]] of the Freeborn [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|Assembly]]. . 

The title can be held by any Freeborn citizen. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Brass Coast National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## House of Guerra
The opportunity to [[What_will_be,_was_not#There_is_Pride_in_Sanctuary|create the House of Guerra]] arose during Spring 383YE, partially in response to a [[statement of principle]] by Constanza i Kalamar i Guerra. In the statement they urged the people of the Brass Coast to take Pride in the ties that bind them together, to support those who find themselves in need of family. It was imagined as a sanctuary specifically designed to serve as a base of operations for Imperial citizens dedicated to offering assistance to those seeking a new home in the Empire. The recent [[Lost_in_translation|difficulties faced by newcomers to the Empire]] perhaps made its value all too clear.

The house itself takes the form of a hostel built near the [[Zemress#The Seminary of Zemress|Seminary of Zemress]] in [[Madruga#Calvos|Calvos]]. A small staff supports the Hand, keeping the place ready for use by refugees and those seeking sanctuary in the Empire. Their numbers are regularly supplemented by priests and pilgrims who attend the Seminary - especially those of [[Zemress islander|Zemress island]] descent - who voluntarily donate a portion of their time to helping newcomers to the Brass Coast to build prosperous new lives for themselves.
