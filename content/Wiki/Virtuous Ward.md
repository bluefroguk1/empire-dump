## Description
This oldest Virtuous Wards still in use in the Empire were crafted by [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] during the turmoil of the Highborn civil war. Crafted in the form of large kite and heater shields, some of these items are still in use and seen as valuable relics akin to the [[Magic_items#Artefacts|artefact]] [[Pilgrim's_Shield|Pilgrim's Shields]]. The shield is of use only to a priest - only someone trained in the ceremony of [[dedication]] can make use of its powers. Whenever an ally heals the bearer, whether with magic or appealing to their [[Heroic skills|will to survive]] the shield creates a brief connection between the priest's spirit and that of the healer, allowing a brief moment of communion that inspires the bearer and rewards them with a burst of renewed energy.

The ''Shield of the Last Navigator'' - or more properly the ''Shield of Edion'' - is a particularly sought-after Virtuous Ward. Allegedly borne by Permion the Lawmaker's brother and bodyguard Edion, the shield was lost 150 years ago during an [[orc]] raid against [[Necropolis]] when ''the Blade of Vigilance'' was sunk by [[Grendel]] pirates. A potent artefact, the shield also bore a powerful [[hallow]] infused with [[Liao#True Liao|true liao]] and its loss was a serious blow to the pride of the Highborn.

As the Shield of Edion suggests, it is common for a Virtuous Ward to be hallowed. Popular hallows reflect the fact that the item is intended to be carried on a battlefield by a warpriest, one who expects to fight toe-to-toe with the enemies of the faithful.
