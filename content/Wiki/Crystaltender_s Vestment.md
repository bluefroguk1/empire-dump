## Description

These simple robes are sometimes reinforced with [[Materials#Common Metals|mithril, silver or golden threads]], and are usually made from [[Materials#Iridescent_Gloaming|rainbow silk]]. They are relatively easy to create, but require painstaking attention to detail in preparing the embroidery that runs through them. While they were originally favoured by magicians who tend [[mana site|mana sites]], they are increasingly popular with magicians who focus their magic on [[spellcasting]] rather than ritual magic. Although a piece of crystallised mana can be used to [[Spellcasting|cast any spell]], many magicians find this robeâ€™s power gives them more versatility.

By invoking the simple charms woven into the fabric of the vestment, a magician can unwind the magical essence inside a piece of crystallized mana. The resulting energy is channeled through the precious metal embroidered into the robe, and infuses the wearer, restoring their personal ability to perform incantations. Many users report a feeling of giddiness and some tingling during the process, but there has been no firm evidence that it is harmful in any way.

These robes are among the signature creations of the [[Weaver_cabal|Witch Weavers]] of [[Dawn]], particularly those who take up war magics later in their careers and need to make use of their ritual-focused resources. Since no obscure materials are needed, this pattern is often the first a witch weaver will learn, testing both their skill at embroidery and enchantment. [[Xun]], the [[runes|rune]] of transformation, is most commonly used along with its associated imagery of [[Mundane_beasts#Iridescent_Butterfly|butterflies]] or [[Legendary beasts#Winged Serpents|winged serpents]]. [[Navarr]] [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|Vates]] also make use of these robes, more often in the form of decorated leather garments, preferring to draw their magic from within than from a crystal that might be dropped or lost when needed.


## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you can consume a piece of crystal mana to restore three points of spent personal mana.
* Materials: Crafting a crystaltender's vestment requires no special resources. It takes two months to make one of these items.



"Addictive?  My dear sir, such rumours are plainly base slander, put about by those less accomplished in the arcane arts.  It simply is not possible to become addicted to mana, no matter how much magical power one absorbs.  Really, I assure you, the late Arbiter Vortis did not explode because he absorbed too much mana!  Clearly, he exploded because he forgot to carry forward a seven in his ritual calculations... I have said all I intend to say on the matter and I bid you a good morning."
