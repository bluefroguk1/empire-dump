### Overview
While the core of the Seventh Wave is heavily armoured guardians, it is supported by a number of unconquered, scouts, skirmishers and magicians. The army makes great use of mixed-arms tactics, supporting shield-and-sword with bow, or bow with polearm and pike. They are adept [[Army qualities#Scouting|scouts]], capable of quickly sizing up their enemies and giving clear reports on all elements of the military campaigns in which they are involved. Shortly before the Summer Solstice 383YE, the Seventh Wave [[Enlargement_of_the_Seventh_Wave|became a large army]].

The second Highborn General leads the Seventh Wave, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Autumn equinox each year
