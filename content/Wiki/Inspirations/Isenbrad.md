Title: Isenbrad
---
## Virtue
[[Isenbrad]] was recognised as a paragon of [[Wisdom]].
## Biography
[[Isenbrad]] of the [[Steinr]] was a smith known for excellent judgement and good counsel. While there are plenty of stories about his deeds, especially in the northern Empire, very few actual facts have ever been confirmed. The most common story involves a miracle attributed to him. At some point the smith quested with a companion named Godric, opposing a terrible troll kingdom. Upon loss of their weapons, he turned his legendary skills to shaping weapons of unmenlting ice from the walls of a cave beneath [[Hahnmark#Runegrott|Runegrott]]. After he and his companions had been victorious, he carved the secrets of his art upon the walls of the ice cave using the [[Runes]].
One thing that is known for certain is that, after his death, he was laid to rest in the swamps of Kallavesa; he is perhaps one of the most  famous [[Steinr]] heroes to rest beneath the [[Kallavesa#The Sovevann|Sovevann]].

## Isenbrad in Play
### Runegrott and Runesmith's Law
Following the Winter Solstice 384YE, the WIntermark National Assembly  [[384YE Winter Solstice Synod judgements#Judgement 87|sent]] the [[Runesmith]] Isolde Hannasdottir to [[Consecration|consecrate]] an [[Inspirational location|memorial]] for [[Isenbrad]] at [[Hahnmark#Runegrott|Runegrott]] in [[Hahnmark]]. This helped establish the [[Wintermark economic interests#Runesmith.27s Law|Runesmith's Law]] - the unique set of [[Magic Items]] that can be crafted only by Winterfolk [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]]. 
Found in southern [[#Northspires|Northspires]], Runegrott is a vast labyrinthine chamber in the ice, in which many runes are carved. They are thought to be very old, and some scholars argue that the origin of [[Rune|runes]] in Wintermark lies here, rather than in the caves beneath [[Skarsind#Gildenheim|Gildenheim]]. It is a matter of debate as to whether the runes bear any message -- some claim the original laws of Wintermark, and thus the Empire -- were taken from the inscriptions in this chamber. More recently they have been connected with the paragon [[Isenbrad]], especially by the [[Runesmith|runesmiths]] who dwell on the mountain above the caves. The chamber is carefully guarded, and now serves as a repository of [[Magic items#Schema|schema]] which only Winterfolk artisans may study, the knowledge contained within being protected by a powerful ''geas'' supported both by the consecration and the connection to the Wintermark [[Egregore]]. 
### Controversies and Later History
* The miracle of forging weapons from ice is often contested by [[Schools of thought#Pragmatic Secularism|pragmatic secularists]] and [[Schools of thought#Virtuous Histography|virtuous histographs]] who argue that it is most likely a metaphor. Critics often quote the work of Hengist of [[Hahnmark#Kalpaheim|Kalpaheim]] who argued that there are several locations in Wintermark where actual metal weapons are entombed in ice, and that this element of Isenbrad's story could well be a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the paragon freeing such weapons from the ice where they were preserved.
* Isenbrad is credited with being the first runesmith, and bringing knowledge of the runes to the people of Wintermark. The true provenance of the runes, however, is a subject for some debate among theologians, [[Wintermark magical traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]], and historians. There are questions about how the [[Jotun]] and [[Thule]] came to employ them - the accepted argument is that they learned them from the Winterfolk, but both barbarian nations refute this explanation. Objects have been found from time to time that appear to date from before the time of Isenbrad yet bear obvious rune markings  and are clearly the work of humans from the north-western Empire.
* As with several older paragons, scholars associated with the [[Schools of thought#Virtuous Histography|virtuous histograph]] school of thought point to the many stories of Isenbrad's innovation and suggest that this is a clear example of the inspirational actions of several real figures being ascribed to a paragon who may or may not have been a real person.
