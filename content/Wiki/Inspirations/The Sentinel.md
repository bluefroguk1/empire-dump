This page refers to the [[Paragon]] of [[Vigilance]]; for the [[Urizen]] martial [[Archetype|archetype]] see [[Sentinel]]
## Virtue
[[The Sentinel]] is upheld as a Paragon of [[Vigilance]]. [[The Sentinel]] was initially identified as such by Wayfarers of the Highborn [[Assembly]] of the Virtuous, but was confirmed by [[The Synod|the Synod]] at its first sitting in 1 YE.
## Biography
There is nothing actually known of The [[Sentinel]] themselves. No text has identified them by name, gender, [[Lineage|lineage]] or nation. The only attestation that this Paragon exists are in a series of ancient structures that can be found throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]], but most particularly in the mountains of [[Morrow]] and in the lands of the Highborn. These ancient towers and defensive structures have stood for generations, and many with the capacity for a warning bell or beacon. The structures and layouts speak of a common design, a template plan - the guiding intentions of a master [[Architect|architect]].
Even by modern standards, the defensive constructions of [[The Sentinel]] stand the test of time. More than one has been simply adapted upon and added to rather than needed to be replaced. More than one [[Urizen]] [[Spire|spire]] or Highborn chapterhouse is built upon, or within, an adapted edifice.
The journey of the [[Sentinel]] to a recognised Exemplar and Paragon has been unusual. To an extent, the anonymous nature of this benevolent builder has enabled priests and pilgrims to project their own understandings upon him or her. Parables have been constructed on the importance of preparing ones' defences against threat, and there have been speculations about the type of threat that the constructions were designed to shield against.
As yet, no [[Liao|liao]] visions have given any [[Insight|insight]]. During her [[Tenure|tenure]] over the [[Assembly]] of [[Vigilance]], [[Cardinal]] Selene of the Highborn was attributed with saying that she hoped that no visions would be forthcoming; not only to preserve [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]]'s Paragon [[Legacy|legacy]], but because the [[Synod]]'s interpretation of the [[Sentinel]] was the most "true".
## Signs
Noting the signs of [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] has been difficult with so little information, but the Synod holds:
* The [[Sentinel]] has achieved Liberation from the Labyrinth of Ages by dint of no past life visions recalling them.
* The Sentinel's edifices and constructions are a clear [[Legacy]] whilst simultaneously being a gift of Benevolence to [[The Empire|the Empire]]
* The constructions and shelters of the Sentinel have granted shelter to virtuous people in need, offering Salvation, and have been instructive to the craftsfolk of [[The Nations|the nations]] and so Inspirational.
* While the initial Synod [[Judgement|judgement]] was that the Sentinel was excused the sign of [[Pilgrimage]] by dint of pre-dating the Highborn arrival to these shores, the Heirs of [[Lepidus]] have discovered the remains of a tower near the city of [[Bastion]] that raises serious questions about whether the paragon may, in fact, have made a [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to the location where the city would later be built.
* Early on, some claimed that the Sentinel's towers could only have been erected by Miraculous means, but over time engineers and artisans have developed methods capable of replicating the Sentinel's achievements; though this does not diminish those advanced achievements
## The Sentinel in Play
### Controversy
* The Sentinel is often used by critics of the [[Judgement|judgement]] of [[Recognition]] as an example of a paragon whose status makes no sense.
## Inspirational Tomb
While the Sentinel has no known tomb, a significant place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] exists in [[Casinea]]. Following the revelation of the research of the Heirs of [[Lepidus]] into the structures of the Sentinel at the behest of the [[Benefactors|benefactors]] council of [[Highguard]], proof was found that the castle was the largest built by the enigmatic paragon and most likely their place of residence given its location. The [[Imperial Synod]] arranged for it to be consecrated by Rhesa, [[Exarch]] of the Scions of Ravensfell, and [[The Senate|the Senate]] commissioned a grand belltower to serve as a place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]]. The title of [[Castellan of the Silent Sentinel]] was created not only to oversee the tower, but also to take custody of the [[Fortification|fortification]] as a whole.
Have you not heard, have you not seen that corpse 
Of shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway 
Antiphonal carillons launched before 
The stars are caught and hived in the sun's ray? 
The bells, I say, the bells break down their tower; 
And swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave 
Membrane through marrow, my long-scattered score 
Of broken intervals… And I, their sexton slave! 
Oval encyclicals in canyons heaping 
The impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain! 
Pagodas campaniles with reveilles out leaping- 
O terraced echoes prostrate on the plain!… 
And so it was I entered the broken world 
To trace the visionary company of love, its voice 
An instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled) 
But not for long to hold each desperate choice. 
My world I poured. But was it cognate, scored 
Of that tribunal monarch of the air 
Whose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word 
In wounds pledges once to hope - cleft to despair? 
The steep encroachments of my blood left me 
No answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower 
As flings the question true?) -or is it she 
Whose sweet mortality stirs latent power?- 
And through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes 
My veins recall and add, revived and sure 
The angelus of wars my chest evokes: 
What I hold healed, original now, and pure… 
And builds, within, a tower that is not stone 
(Not stone can jacket heaven) - but slip 
Of pebbles, - visible wings of silence sown 
In azure circles, widening as they dip 
The matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes 
That shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower… 
The commodious, tall decorum of that sky 
Unseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.
The Broken Tower, by Harold Hart Crane
