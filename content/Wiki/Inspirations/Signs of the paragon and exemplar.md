## [[Signs of the paragon and exemplar|Signs of the Paragon and Exemplar]]
[[The Synod]] is tasked with the [[Recognition]] of [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]]. Over time, the learned assemblies have identified signs that can be used to identify  [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]]. Of these signs, exemplars are expected to have demonstrated four signs. Paragons [[Will|will]] have been recorded as having completed at least six, and traditionally not have contradicted any of the others, which may have [[Gone|gone]] unrecorded.
The signs are:
### Liberation
This sign is unique to paragons. The virtuous souls of true paragons are able to navigate the Labyrinth of Ages and depart it. Some claim this enlightenment allows them to enter the presence of the Creator; others that they move on to a higher form of existence in the heavens or another world. Evidence for this comes in part from no other mortal ever having had a [[Past life vision|past life vision]] from the perspective of a known [[Paragon|paragon]]. A contentious variation of this sign is Ascension, which holds that some paragons have attained Liberation whilst alive and have disappeared before their followers, such as [[Aldones di Sarvos]].
### [[Recognition]]
This sign applies to [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]]. The journey of the human soul toward enlightment and transcendence can take several lifetimes. It is widely understood many paragons were exemplars in former lives, and many exemplars were either exemplars or [[Heroes|heroes]] in former lives. Consequently, identifying that a person was a hero, notable figure, or even an exemplar in a former life is one of the Signs that they may be an exemplar in this life, and are on [[The Way|the way]] to becoming a paragon. For this reason, many pilgrims eagerly seek to take True [[Liao]] in search of support for their own exemplarhood.
### Benevolence
This sign applies to [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]]. Any citizen may illustrate a Virtue in a pure, yet self-serving, manner. However, the deeds of the paragon or exemplar prosper their whole people, such as [[Tian]] bringing fire from the sun, [[Kethry]]'s salvation of her people, or the [[First Empress]] founding [[The Empire|the Empire]]. In the age of [[The Empire|the Empire]], the sign of benevolence is one that benefits [[The Empire|the Empire]]; in whole or in part.
### Inspiration
This sign applies to [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]]. Paragons and exemplars are inspiring figures who make an impact on those they meet in life and who often attract students, followers or imitators. Sometimes these followers [[Will|will]] found orders, societies, [[Chapters|chapters]] or other [[Groups|groups]] to retain and pass on the teachings of their mentor, teacher or leader. These groups go on to do great works in the paragon or exemplar’s name.
### Miracles
The legends of some paragons and exemplars attribute great and miraculous deeds to them, such as [[Tian]] stealing fire from the sun, the power of [[Good Walder]] to reward the virtuous, or the incredible strength of [[Inga Tarn]]. It is said that the ability to perform superhuman feats, namely miracles, without using [[Magic|magic]], is a sign of a soul approaching transcendence.
In recent times, there has been a widespread belief that miracles were unique to paragons, but it is difficult to entirely reconcile this with all the evidence. [[Inga Tarn]], for example, performed miraculous feats of strength, but is an exemplar. Even quite recently there have been many credible witnesses to incidents where powerful spontaneous auras have formed around people, places, and objects with no intervention from practitioners of [[Liao]] ceremonies, for which there is no easy explanation. 
The issue remains fiercely debated with some priests refusing to recognize miracles as a sign of exemplar while others take a more pragmatic approach.
### [[Pilgrimage]]
This sign applies to paragons and exemplars and dates back to the origins of [[The Way]] in [[Highguard]], when spiritual leaders, pilgrims and scholars travelled from many nations to [[Bastion]] to learn of [[The Way]]. This included, so it is claimed, many exemplars and paragons, for whom it was a necessary catalyst for their soul's purification. In the age of [[The Empire|the Empire]], this has been understood to be a journey to the heart of the Imperial Faith, though that has been interpreted as a physical and spiritual journey.
### Salvation
As well as inspiring those already inclined to virtue, a true paragon or exemplar [[Will|will]] have a significant success in reducing the number of the un-Virtuous in the world. While citizens may do this by sending their souls back to the Labyrinth in droves, a paragon [[Will|will]] convert a significant group of people from their unvirtuous ways. In the days of [[The Empire|the Empire]] this can include foreigners and [[Barbarians|barbarians]], but may also extend to the salvation of Imperial Citizens who have lost their way, such as being seduced by blasphemous or idolatrous cults.
### [[Legacy]]
This sign applies to paragons and exemplars. Akin to the sign of Inspiration, this sign relates to that which a paragon or exemplar  leaves behind them. The most common form of [[Legacy|legacy]] is in the form of a relic or relics, such as Irontooth, the legendary axe of [[Korl]], or the Imperial [[Throne]] left by the [[First Empress]]. Less common, but no less valid, are other enduring legacies, such as the great edifices of [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]]. These legacies are usually an integral part of the paragon’s legend, serving as proof of their truth and as an inspiration to others.
