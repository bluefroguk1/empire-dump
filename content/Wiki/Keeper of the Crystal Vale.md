## Overview
The Keeper of the Crystal Vale is a [[Wintermark]] [[Imperial title]] created following an [[Construct_Vales_Might|announcement]] in Winter 380YE by the [[Civilian Commissioner]]. The Vale was completed shortly before the 381YE Spring Equinox. The position of Keeper is a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities
The Keeper has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Game_items#Mana_Crystals|crystal mana]] from the [[#Vale's Might|Vale's Might]] in [[Hahnmark]]. If the vale were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Keeper to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Keeper of the Crystal Vale gains custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. They receive an income of 10 crystal mana each season.
==Appointment== 
The Keeper of the Crystal Vale is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Wintermark]] [[senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 

The title can be held by a Wintermark citizen. The Keeper has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wintermark [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Vale's Might
The great stone pillared entrance to Vales Might is flanked by two large stone and metal braziers, each with the [[Pallas|rune of Wealth]] carved upon it. These are lit during the winter months to guide hunters, traders and other lost folk back to a place of warmth and safety. Vale's Might stands near its sister sinecure the [[Herbalist_of_the_Hearth#The Valley of Pride|Valley of Pride]]. It is located in the foot of the nearby cliffs and high hills that stand just outside the village of Woodhall. 

The Wintermark hall of Hendle Hearth can been seen from the entrance to Vales Might and is a mere few minutes’ walk away. [[Hahnmark#Southridge|Southridge]] and [[Hahnmark#Wood Heath|Wood Heath]] lie less than a days travel away in opposite directions from the impressive entrance to this sinecure. To gain access here you must first pass the huge doors that are designed to hold fast against all save the worst of winter storms, or all but the most ferocious and determined of attackers. 

Once inside, a visitor must follow the twists and turns of the passage that snakes its way down level by level, deeper and deeper into the depths. At the bottom of the passage is a final mighty door, above which is engraved the message "''The ebb and flow of magic will forever match the ebb and flow of the Empire. Long live the Empire''.” 

The door opens into a large cavern whose walls are studded with crystals. A pool of silvery water is spread thinly across the bottom of the cavern, and all of the crystals can be seen to have grown over the decades from the water.
