The position of claviger is a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of [[liao]], and additional votes in the [[Imperial Synod]].

The title is a little bit of a mouthful; informally the holder is sometimes being referred to as ''Cora's Claviger''.

## Powers
### Bounty of Liao
The sinecure provides nine measures of [[liao]] to the Claviger each season, to be used as they see fit.
### Voice in the Synod
The Claviger receives eighteen votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. They may use these votes in any appropriate assembly, following the [[Sinecure#Synod_Votes|normal rules for votes provided by a Sinecure]].
## Appointment
The Claviger is a [[New_Imperial_titles#The_Imperial_Synod|virtue position]] which is [[Appointment|appointed]] by [[judgement]] of the [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|Loyalty assembly]]. 

The Claviger has [[tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Assembly of Loyalty, and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Basilica of Cora Holdfast

A fusion of Highborn and Navarri styles and materials, built from white granite from the [[Vigilant Swan]] and weirwood from the [[Thimble]] in [[Therunin]]. The basilica of Cora Holdfast in [[Reikos#High_Chalcis|High Chalcis]] is part meditative shrine and part meeting hall for pilgrims from across the Empire.

The front of the complex is a long wooden hall where visiting pilgrims are encouraged to meet their fellows over food and drink, share their ideas and problems and offer support to each other. It is a noisy and busy place but one that offers inspiration to pilgrims, who are encouraged to help each other get things done, and draw strength from the ideals of [[Loyalty]] that Cora exemplified.

At end of the hall is a large, square, domed stone chamber. Quieter and more somber that the meeting hall, a white granite statue of the exemplar stands on a raised platform in the centre. This lifelike carving shows Cora Holdfast her with her arms crossed looking upon pilgrims with a listening but challenging expression. Scenes of Cora's life and her [[Cora_Holdfast#Signs|Signs]] are displayed on the surrounding walls in mosaics intended to educate and inspire. Underneath the statue are hundreds of small pigeonholes where pilgrims leave written oaths and promises that they want to acknowledge, or seek help in keeping. These are cleared daily but it is customary that those who leave a written oath or promise take away and wear a slip of pink ribbon as a token of their pilgrimage and commitment.
