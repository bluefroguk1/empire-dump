## Hall of the Unbroken
The Hall of the Unbroken is actually a series of buildings dotted around the hot pools that occur in the East Floes. A place of rest and healing, the waters are often used as part of the process of helping visitors. Carved into the door of each building are the words "''Welcome to the Hall of the Unbroken, part of the Proffered Hand, the work of Lady Eleanor Novarion''". 

The largest of the buildings has a series of [[mithril]] pillars designed to direct the flows of magic into strategically placed rare salts. Above the lintel of the main door the words "''For the Empire and in honour of Brienne Stormborn and Tyr Brenna''" are etched and flanked by engravings of the rune of [[Pallas|wealth]].
