## Overview
For the [[Events]] at [[Dadford Road Campsite]] this year we will be operating a system to assist all players getting their kit onto and off the IC and OOC fields. This page explains how the system works, so that you can understand how to take advantage of it.
## Mules
* We have hired 6 ATVs - all terrain vehicles to move kit around on site for players and crew
* We have recruited half a dozen new crew to operate the vehicles on set-up and take down
* The mules will be available Thursday and Friday and throughout take-down
We will have six ATVs - all terrain vehicles - mostly Kawasaki mules like the one pictured. Some of the mules will have trailers to carry extra kit. We have recruited a team of new crew purely to operate them so that we can move equipment quickly and simply around the site for players. In addition we expect to have a tractor and large trailer for moving heavy equipment.
## Requesting Help
* Make your way to a Mule pick-up point and request [[Assistance]]
* They will radio GOD who will log your name, location and time
* GOD will direct the mules to the next person on the list as soon as one comes free
* You must remain with your equipment to be sure that you do not miss your slot
* Make sure your equipment is ready to be quickly loaded
We are going to log all requests for assistance from players on the site (you cannot request a slot in advance). This will allow us to make sure that we are able to help players move their kit into place as quickly as possible with the fewest possible delays. To get help, you need to go to a Mule pick-up point and request assistance. Please tell them roughly how much equipment you have (a car load, a trailer fUll, a van load etc) and show them where you will be waiting. They will log your request with GOD. GOD will manage the list and send an ATV to your mule pick-up point for you as soon as one becomes free.
Please make sure that you remain in the area once you have requested help. We will get to you as quickly as possible - but we will move to the next name on the list if we cannot find you quickly.
Please have your kit ready to be loaded as quickly as possible. Once your kit is loaded, at least one of you should travel with the mule driver to your destination. You will then need to unload your equipment. The quicker you can load and unload your equipment - the quicker we can help everyone.
## Mobility Needs
* We expect able-bodied players to load and unload their own equipment, but help is able to anyone who needs it.
We expect able-bodied players to load and unload the own equipment from the mules, but the crew operating them will provide assistance with loading and unloading for anyone who needs it. If you need help then please let the operator know.
## Arrival
* There will be a pick-up point in the quiet camping field next to the main gate
* There will be one pick-up point in each of the OOC camping fields
* If you need to move equipment to two locations, then you may request assistance twice
There will be a pick-up point in the quiet camping field - near the main gate - and another one in each of the OOC camping fields. They will either be wearing a crew t-shirt and red hat or a hi-[[Vis]] waistcoat. 
If you need to drop equipment in the OOC field and in the IC field, then tell the crew operating the mule. You may put all your kit on one mule - but the driver cannot wait while you put a tent up - you must unload all your kit from the mule before putting anything up. If you prefer you may move your equipment first to the OOC camp first, put up that tent - then request Assistance again and get a second mule to help you move your remaining equipment to the IC field.
## Departure
* There will be a pick-up point in each nation camp
* There will be one pick-up point in each of the OOC camping fields
* If you need to move equipment from two locations, then you may request Assistance twice
On departure, we will deploy a member of the crew to the rough centre of each nation camp to act as a point of contact for players to request a mule, and one crew member to each of the two OOC camping fields. They will either be wearing a crew t-shirt and red hat or a hi-vis waistcoat.
If you need to move equipment from the OOC field and the IC camping field, then you may put all your kit on one mule - but only if everything is packed and ready to go. The crew operating the mule will only wait while you are loading kit, not while you are taking a tent down. If you do not wish to take all your tents down at once then you can request assistance a second time once you are ready to move the remainder of your equipment.
