## Overview
This page lists all the details that are specific for our fifth Empire event - the [[Winter Solstice 2014]]. There is an additional page with [[Event Information]] which lists arrival and departure times and similar details that are common for all Empire [[Events|events]].
## [[Battles]]
At the event we [[Will|will]] be running two large [[Battles|battles]], one Saturday morning and one Sunday morning, along with a large number of smaller encounters. The large battles [[Will|will]] follow the normal rules for Battles; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one.
The fighting begins at 11:00 am - but if you are playing the battle then you [[Will|will]] need to [[Muster|muster]] up before this time and if you are [[Monstering|monstering]] then you need to make your way to the monster area for 10:00 am to give us time to get you into [[Costume|costume]], made-up and briefed.
### Volunteering
Players are welcome to volunteer to help PD crew the smaller encounters, but are not obliged to do so - anyone who volunteers to help by [[Monstering|monstering]] an encounter [[Will|will]] receive a token that enables you to collect a free drink from the bar as thanks.
## Site Map
The map shows the layout of the OOC camping fields and the IC area. The grey lines in the in-character field are roads that go through the camps. These roads [[Will|will]] be laid out with fencing pins and nylon rope until the start of the event. You must not pitch your tent in the road, the red hats are under instructions to move any tents pitched in the IC roads.
No unescorted vehicles are allowed in the IC camping area - you may only use the road indicated by the grey line that circles around the field. The road will be wide enough for you to pull up and park so that you can unload your vehicle next to your camp. Please unload your camping equipment and then move your vehicle to the car park before putting up your tent to allow other players to unload.
If you have a trailer or a large vehicle filled with heavy kit then you may drive that on to the field to unload. To do that you must wait at the IC entrance to the field. A member of the PD security team will then escort you vehicle to your camp where you can unload your vehicle. Once you are ready to move your vehicle to the car park you must request a member of the PD team escort your vehicle off the field.
## OOC Camping
The OOC camping area will be laid out in lines with fencing pins and nylon rope. The system is designed to separate the tents from the cars so the rope has signs hanging from it which indicates that you should park you car adjacent to the rope and then pitch your tent ''[[On the other side|on the other side]] of the rope''.
Do not pitch your tents in the wide lane between the [[Guide|guide]] ropes, this lane must be kept free for access.
