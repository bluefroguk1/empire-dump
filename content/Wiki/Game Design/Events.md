## Overview
Profound Decisions will run four Empire [[Events|events]] each year. Although we are keen to give players the freedom to run their own Empire [[Events|events]] if they wish, we believe it is also important for players to know what level of commitment and involvement a game presents. Therefore there will only ever be four Profound Decisions Empire [[Events|events]] each year.
## Event Dates in 2024
OOC details for all our events in 2024 are below. If you have any questions about the details then please [mailto:admin@profounddecisions.co.uk email us] and we will endeavour to answer them for you.

## Time-in and Time-out
Time in is at 6pm on Friday and 10am on Saturday and Sunday morning. Time-out is at 1am Saturday morning and Sunday morning. The event ends with final time-out at 3pm on Sunday.
## Early Arrival
Although there is no role-playing before time-in on Friday, you are very welcome to arrive early to begin setting up your camp. The bar will be open on Thursday evening and our caterers will be aiming to provide hot food. Please enjoy this [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to socialize out-of-character.
The earliest that you can arrive is 1:00 pm on the Thursday before each event. Please note that the arrival time is two hours later than last year - as we need the additional time to finish site preparations before players arrive. There is an additional charge of £10 for anyone who stays on site on Thursday night that must be paid on the gate in cash only.
## Location
All our events in 2023 will be held at our current site next to [[Dadford Road Campsite]], off Dadford Road, near Dadford in Buckinghamshire.
## Booking and Prices
[[Online]] booking is available for all Profound Decisions events via our [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/ [[Online|online]] account system]. Please create an account, enter your details and choose which events you wish to attend. You can even use the [[Online|online]] booking system if you wish to pay by cheque as the system will give you a single booking reference to write on the back of your cheque.
All our events cost £80 if booked well in advance. The price rises after the early booking deadline and then again if you pay on the gate. Please see our [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/event/deadlines ticket booking deadlines] for details. Various discounts are available and all discounts are cumulative.
### Multi-booking Discounts
If you book for more than one event simultaneously then you are receive a £5 discount for each additional event that you book. For example, if you book for three events then you are eligible for a discount of £10 from the total price. 
### Concessions
Players are eligible for a discount of £25 off the price of each event if they are eligible for concessions. Anyone who is a full time student, a full time member of the armed services, a pensioner, or receives state benefits as their main income is eligible for the concession on the ticket price. You only have to be eligible at the point where you provide the proof of your eligibility, so students can claim the discount for the year even if their course ends in the Summer.
You must provide proof of your eligibility. The best way to do this is to email proof to us at [mailto:admin@profounddecisions.co.uk admin@profounddecisions.co.uk] after you have booked. We can then mark your entire booking as having the concession confirmed. If you don't do this then you will need to bring proof to the event and then queue up in a long queue at GOD before you can play. Please don't do this, it's bad for you and bad for us! Email us a scan of your proof and we will log it to your account.
## Payment
### Ebanking
You can pay for your ticket with a simple bank transfer, which is quick and easy especially if you use internet or telephone banking. The online booking system will provide you with a simple reference number to use when making your booking. This reference number is unique for your account and never changes.
Bank transfers are by far the cheapest way for us to take payment. If you do not mind what payment method you use then please pay by bank transfer as it helps us considerably.
### Standing Orders
You can set up a standing order to pay for your tickets. The online booking system will provide you with a simple reference number to use when making your booking. This reference number is unique for your account and never changes. We do not get charged for standing order payments, so like bank transfers, it helps us out considerably if you choose to pay this way.
### Cheque
Profound Decisions no longer accepts cheques as a valid form of payment.
### Card Payments
Your can use most cards to pay for your bookings if you use the online booking system. If you don't wish to enter your details online then you can phone the office on 0845 0944 798 and we can process a card payment for you. 
## Cancellations and Transfers
You may cancel or transfer a ticket for an event if you inform us before 6pm on the Friday that the event begins. You can inform us by sending an email or leaving a message on our answer machine. We reserve the right to charge a £5 administration fee for cancellations or transfers within two weeks of the start of an event.
