## Definition
A [[Mine]] represents a worked holding. It could be a small but profitable shaft mine, a series of underground tunnels, or it could be something as small as a panning operation.
## Production
Upon taking a mine, you must choose one of green iron, tempest jade, weltsilver or orichalcum. A mine produces 12 ingots of the chosen material.
## Downtime Options
It is possible to obtain additional [[Materials]] from a mine during any given season. You may spend 6 crowns to have the Mine produce an additional 5 ingots of the same material as it would naturally produce.
## Upgrades
A Mine can be upgraded using [[Mithril]] obtained from the Bourse. Each time a Mine is upgraded, the owner receives an additional 2 ingots from then on.
To upgrade a mine requires Imperial wains of mithril equal to the level the mine is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 mine Costs 2 Imperial wains of mithril, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.
## Diversification
A mine can be diversified to sacrifice production of one material for another. To diversify a mine costs one throne. Each time a mine diversifies, the owner chooses a different resource from the list for mines; the mine produces 2 ingots of the new material at the expense of 2 less of the original material. 
## Rituals
The table below shows a list of the rituals in both [[Imperial lore]] and [[Urizen]] lore which can affect the production of a business.
