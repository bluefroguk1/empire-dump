## Introduction
With around three thousand players at each event, Empire has an active [[Online|online]] community that use a wide range of different social media. We maintain our own Facebook groups and forums for users to discuss [[The game|the game]] and related issues but there are also a plethora of Facebook groups used by different groups of players.
## Forum
Profound Decisions also host their own [http://forums.profounddecisions.co.uk/ official Empire forum] for players and crew alike. These forums are moderated by the same team that supervise all our official Facebook groups to ensure posts remain civil and relevant. They are a great place to chat with [[The game|the game]] designers or the crew about any aspect of Empire especially for those who prefer the kind of longer, more thoughtful conversations, that forums encourage.
