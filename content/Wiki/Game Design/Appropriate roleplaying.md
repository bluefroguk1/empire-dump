*Many abilities require appropriate roleplaying to use
All religious, magical, and heroic skills require appropriate roleplaying to use. The roleplaying can be anything that is appropriate to your characterization and to the ability that you are using. Most skills of this kind require some audible speech or noise as part of the roleplaying.
For example, you are using the heroic skill that allows you to break an enemy's bones with your great sword. The appropriate roleplaying is a blow that you roleplay being swung with great force and perhaps a war-cry or an almighty groan of exertion.
