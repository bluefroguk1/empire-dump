## Overview
Carer tickets are intended to be used by people who need to be onsite to support a player with their physical or mental Health needs. They can also be used by anyone who needs to be onsite as the responsible adult for a player between 11 and 15 years old, and who doesn't want to play the game. 
We expect people attending [[Events]] on a carers ticket to be onsite, but not playing the game. Anyone is welcome to book on a fUll ticket to play the game at any time, and you can convert a [[Carer ticket]] to a full player ticket by paying the difference.
These tickets are not available on the website like a standard ticket. They are only available on request, and need to be organised through the office at [mailto:admin@profounddecisions.co.uk admin@profounddecisions.co.uk]. Carer tickets are not right for everyone, and it's important to read and understand the rules outlined here. If you have any questions you can contact us at the same address.
## In and Out of Character
The event is held on a site that spreads over several fields. The game is active on the ''In Character'' (IC) fields, but the fields around this are ''Out of Character'' (OC). On the IC fields while the game is running, people are playing their characters and expected to be In Character and must be in [[Costume]]. In the OC fields no one is in character, and costume does not have to be worn. On the site map found on the event page, the In character fields are the ones marked with nation camps.

## Supporting Health Needs
We know that certain elements of the live roleplaying hobby can present Challenges to players with specific access requirements, and we aim to make reasonable adjustment for disabled players. Some players will benefit from having out of character support at an event, and the carers ticket allows someone to be on hand when needed. We trust players to manage their own [[Accessibility]] needs, so there's no requirement to provide any additional information to use a carer ticket. Information around accessibility can be found [https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/accessibility on our website].
## Responsible Adults
We consider players in the 11-15 age range are able to participate and roleplay fully in the game setting as to be just as capable of remaining in-character all day as any adult. At this age it is acceptable for participants to roleplay for long periods without a responsible adult being present. You should still be aWare of what the young person is doing, and they should check in regularly with you. Further information have be found in our Information for 11-15 year olds.
