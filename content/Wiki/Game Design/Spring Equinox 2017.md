## [[Battles]]
At the event we [[Will|will]] be running two large [[Battles|battles]], one Saturday morning and one Sunday morning. The large battles [[Will|will]] follow the normal rules for Battles; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one. The sides for the battles will be chosen by the generals in the [[Muster]] of the [[Imperial Military Council]] on Friday [[Night|night]]. 
The [[Sentinel Gate]] opens at 11:00 am - regardless of whether anyone is ready or not! If you are playing then make sure you arrive in plenty of time before this so your weapons can be checked.
If you are [[Monstering|monstering]] then you need to make your way to the monster area between 9:30 and 10:00 am to give us time to get you into [[Costume|costume]], made-up and briefed. If you turn up after 10:30 you will be turned away.
At this event, the best estimate of the fighting strength of each nation provided by the civil service is as follows. of their options, which nations could take [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] together. Each of the two battles must have at least 54 and at most 57 force weight sent on it. 
### National Weightings
All [[The Nations|the nations]] are much bigger than the numbers listed - the numbers listed reflect the relative numerical strength of the nations not the actual number of fighters who take the field.

[[Monstering]] during this slot is purely voluntary - but it will help us put on a much better event for everyone. We are tracking the numbers of players who volunteer from each nation on an ongoing basis and using that to create equivalent sized quest [[Opportunities|opportunities]] for those nations at the next event. In effect, we'll try and deliver more fights to the nations that volunteer the most - on the assumption that those nations contain the players who want those opportunities the most.

## Site Map
The site map is opposite; the camp coordinators for each camp will have their own layout for their camp, showing where all the tents they know about are to be pitched. If you do not know where you are supposed to be camping, then please speak to them on arrival at your nation's camp.
## Mobility Camp
The area marked with a wheelchair on the out-of-character camp is intended for participants with mobility needs. We have permission from the land owner for the handful of players with legitimate mobility needs to come and go from this area through the weekend. Please let the crew know if you have a disability that means you will need to camp here.
The nearest disabled toilet is approximately 10 m away in the adjacent hygiene block. There is a second disabled toilet 120 m away in the in-character field near [[Varushka]] and the [[Imperial Orcs]].
