Formed nearly four hundred years ago when the [[First Empress]] began her [[Crusade|crusade]] to unite all humanity, [[The Empire|the Empire]] has grown and prospered ever since despite being surrounded by [[Barbarian|barbarian]] enemies. Made up of nine great nations, [[The Empire|the Empire]] is politically and legally unified. Everyone is an Imperial citizen but [[The Empire|the Empire]] seeks to maintain the unique culture and customs of the different nations.
[[The Empire]] has a complex political system that shares power between a number of institutions. At its head is [[The Throne]], the seat of the Emperor or Empress and the most powerful political position in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. [[The Throne]] is not hereditary; the occupant is chosen by [[The Senate|the Senate]] (a council of representatives chosen from each nation) to oversee the running of the Empire. When the [[Throne]] is empty, most of its powers are held by the [[Senate]].
[[The Synod]] exists to keep the Empire virtuous. This august body is formed from every priest in the Empire who has a recognized [[Congregation|congregation]]. It has many powers defined in the [[Imperial Constitution]], and is the only body able to dismiss an Imperial citizen from a position once they have been appointed. The prosecution of wars and the defence of the Empire is the responsibility of the generals appointed to the [[Military Council]], whilst the most powerful magicians in the Empire protect and support their own through [[The Conclave|the Conclave]]. [[The Bourse]] oversees matters of economics, helping to build the Empire and enrich its citizens.
The [[Day|day]]-to-day operation of the Empire is attended to by the [[Magistrates|magistrates]] and functionaries of the [[Imperial Civil Service]]. These NPCs (non-player [[Characters|characters]]) ensure that the laws are upheld. They also ensure that the tedious [[Business|business]] of logistics and administration is attended to without those who rule having to waste their time with such matters. They have an untarnished reputation for integrity and impartiality. The magistrates ensure that everyone has recourse to [[The Law|the law]], while the functionaries see that armies are fed and transported where the Generals order and that workers are hired and paid for building projects that the Senate authorizes. 
What binds the Empire together is [[The Way|the Way]] of Virtue, a single religion shared by every citizen which teaches that humans enjoy reincarnation after death and that adherence to the seven great Virtues [[Will|will]] ensure a swift reincarnation. [[The Way]] recognizes the [[Legacy|legacy]] of the [[Heroes|heroes]] of the past, while encouraging every citizen to work towards the triumph of humanity.
That triumph is not assured; the Empire has enemies on all sides, that look on the success of humanity with jealous eyes. They remember a time when they ruled this land and pounce on any [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to restore their own fortunes. The dream of the [[First Empress]] [[Will|will]] not be complete until these [[Barbarians|barbarians]] are defeated once and for all.
## Five things to know about the Empire
*It is an enlightened republic. The Empire belongs to its citizens and at its best it serves their interest. It does not keep slaves or discriminate between its citizens on grounds of age, gender, sexuality or [[Lineage|lineage]].
*It is unified by faith. [[The Way]] of Virtue is the official state religion based on philosophy and reincarnation. It is the only legal religion allowed in the Empire and is accepted in some form by almost all citizens.
*It does not tolerate murder. The Empire has a strong legal system that serves to identify and prosecute criminals especially murderers. Our NPC magistrates [[Will|will]] use every possible in-character [[Resource|resource]] to punish those who break the [[Law|law]].

*It is defended by its [[Heroes|heroes]]. The Empire relies on its heroic citizens to defend it. Many elements of Imperial society works to encourage the citizenry to step up to this [[Challenge|challenge]]. [[Children]] are taught to be the [[Heroes|heroes]] of tomorrow.
## What the Empire is not
*An aristocracy. The Senate appoints an Emperor or Empress and the senators are in turn chosen by the prominent inhabitants of [[The Nations|the nations]].
