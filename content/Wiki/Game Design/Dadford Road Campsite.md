## Overview
All our [[Events]] in 2023 will be held on the land next to [[Dadford Road Campsite]].
Now that we have had time to address the access issues on the site, the restrictions which were in place at Easter have been significantly relaxed. Please read the information below carefUlly.
## Queries
For all site related queries about Profound Decisions events at Dadford Road Campsite, please Contact Profound Decisions, please do not attempt to contact the site.
## Arrival
* The entrance to the site is marked Dadford Road campsite
* Continue on the [[Farm]] track, past the buildings, until you get to the woods that is part of the event site
* There will be a temporary road for vehicles made from wood chip running through the event site
Our gate team will be on hand to meet you by the side of the track at the boundary of the event site. They will be able to answer any questions you have on the day and give you additional direction.
There are temporary roads made of wood chip that go through the out-of-character camp, through [[Anvil]] and back round to the farm track. Vehicles are allowed to leave the road provided the conditions are acceptable, please check with a member of crew for further details when you are on site.
### OOC Camping Fields
* We have hired two additional fields for OOC camping in 2023 so that sleeping tents can be as close to the game as possible
The OOC camping fields are adjacent to the Anvil fields. There are four main out-of-character fields. There is a large field behind the woods and a second field adjacent to it for the use of [[Dawn]] and [[Wintermark]] and else who wishes to use them. There is a large field that runs alongside the farm track, half of which is allocated to participants with mobility needs. Finally there is a large field that runs along the crew strip.
### IC Camping Fields
* If you want to camp in-character, then you must let your nation Camp pcamp planner know
* There are new rules in operation for in-character camping and vehicle access at the start of 2023
Anvil is spread over the small woods and the two adjoining fields. If you wish to camp in-character, then you must let the Camp planner for your nation know. There are new rules in place for in-character camping this year, so we can only guarantee sleeping space on the IC field to people with [[Accessibility]] or childcare needs. 
You can bring your car onto the in-character field to set up your camp. You can drive onto the roads through IC camping fields provided that you do so before time-in, but you can only leave the roads if the weather is dry and the ground is in good condition. Space is at a premium on site and the spot where you stop to unload is likely to be needed by someone to else to camp. For this reason, you must unload and set up your camp as quickly as you can and then move you vehicle off site as soon as you are done. You must not leave your vehicle on site over night.
During take-down there is simply not enough room for everyone to bring their car onto the site while all the tents are still up. We need participants to make room for vehicles and be off as quickly as possible, otherwise the traffic on the site becomes gridlocked and nothing can move. For this reason you must take your tent down and pack up your belongings before you bring your vehicle on site, unless you need to bring your vehicle on first for accessibility reasons (such as disability, fatigue, childcare, etc). Once everything is down and ready to be packed away, you can bring your car onto site (assuming ground conditions are reasonable), collect your stuff and go. We strongly recomMend bringing a plastic sheet, tarpaulin or similar to protect your gear from any inclement weather.
This rule applies up to 7pm on Sunday - after that time participants are free to drive onto site without needing to take their tents down first. We will actively review this deadline between events and move it Earlier in the day if we are confident that we can do so without the site becoming deadlocked.
All these rules apply to the IC camping areas only, there are no equivalent restrictions on vehicle movements in the OOC or crew camping areas.
### Crew Camping Fields
* Camping for crew only
The crew camping field is for crew only. Crew may choose to camp here or in any of the player camping areas. GOD, and monster will all operate from this area.
## Accessibility Support
There are dedicated accessibility camps at all entrances to the site for anyone who needs to use them. We will provide additional support available where possible - email us at [mailto:accessibility@profounddecisions.co.uk Accessibility@profounddecisions.co.uk] to discuss what arrangements will suit you best. We aim to make our events accessible to all and will do everything we can to help you enjoy the event.
## Site regulations
### Ground Fires
Fires must not be set on the ground, they must only be lit on the oil drums provided or an equivalent that keeps the fire off the ground. Existing fires should be completely extinguished each night. We are arranging firewood for the site. The site includes land that is actively farmed - so please do not throw rubbish that does not burn into campfires - particularly tins, bottles and bottle tops.
### Rubbish
Please make sure that all your rubbish is suitably bagged and disposed of in the skip before you leave site. Do not overfill your rubbish bags - more bags are available on request from GOD at any time. The skip is located in the main OOC field. Please ask for directions if you cannot find it.
