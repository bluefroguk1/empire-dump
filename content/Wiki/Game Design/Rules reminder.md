## Overview
A handy archive of [[Empire rules|rules]] reminders from the left bar.
## List
* Once you have gained the benefit of a [[Magic Items|magic item]], no-one else can use it for that day. Furthermore, you cannot gain the benefit of a different item of the same form ([[Magic items#Weapons|Weapon]], [[Magic items#Armour|Armour]], [[Magic items#Talismans|Talisman]]) that day. (03/01/2024)
* When using things that grant [[Magical skills#Gaining additional ranks|additional ranks]] of [[Magical skills#Realm Lore|realm lore]] the highest you can go is triple your original skill (so you can't have more than two extra ranks if you've only bought one rank of realm lore). (04/12/2023)
* You take damage from any [[Combat#Heroic Blows|call]] made with a weapon or implement even if the call doesn't affect you. (12/11/2023)
* It takes at least two free hands to [[Combat#Moving a dying character|move]] someone who's dead, [[Combat#Dying|dying]], Combat#Terminal|terminal]], or [[Calls#PARALYSE|paralysed]] (07/08/2023)
* You must have purchased at least one rank of a [[Magical skills#Realm Lore|realm lore]] skill to benefit from anything that grants [[Magical skills#Gaining additional ranks|additional ranks]] in that realm. (17/07/2023)
* [[Potion#Consuming a Potion|Using]] a [[Potion]] or [[Potion#Philtres|philtre]] takes five seconds of [[Appropriate roleplaying|appropriate roleplaying]], usually involving miming drinking the potion. (10/07/2023)
* When you're [[Combat#Dying|dying]] you aren't unconscious unless you want to be - you can still speak, shout, or scream for help. (07/07/2023)
* You can only be under the effect of one [[Enchantment]] at a time; the most recent is the [[Enchantment#Removing Enchantments|only one]] that applies! (03/07/2023)
* You can't use [[Heroic skills#Unstoppable|Unstoppable]] if you're under the effects of a [[Calls#WEAKNESS|WEAKNESS]] or [[Calls#PARALYSE|PARALYSE]] (26/06/2023)
* You need to [[Bow safety#Essential Check|check your arrows]] both when you pick them up ''and'' when you put them onto the bow! (22/06/2023)
