## Overview
These guidelines are for all OOC [[Traders|traders]] who are attending Empire [[Events|events]] to sell goods for real money. If you are interested in trading for real money at an Empire event please make sure that you have read these rules carefully.
The trade area is the centre of the event, and includes the main sets built to support the event, such as the tavern and [[The Senate|the senate]]. Most of the rules and regulations for trading at [[Events|events]] are designed to ensure that we maintain a high level of immersion in this area.
## No Spaces at Present
At present, due to the popularity of [[The game|the game]] with players and [[Traders|traders]], we are unable to accept any new requests for trade pitches at the event. If you wish to be added to the waiting list for a pitch then please [mailto:angel@profounddecisions.co.uk contact us].
## Options
There are two options for anyone who wishes to sell non-food/drink items for OOC money, either a standard trader or a peddler. Both options require you to purchase a player ticket and follow all the normal guidelines for a player. A pedlar may then go about the camp and sell their goods as they choose. If you want to have a trade pitch for a tent in the main market place then you to pay a small additional charge for a pitch and follow the additional guidelines for a trader.
Peddlers can sell out of their own tent as a peddler, anywhere within the nation camps, provided you avoid setting up too close to the official marketplace. Alternatively, a peddler can sell off a blanket or cart etc in the marketplace as long as they are not obstructing the traders set up in the marketplace or in a place that would spoil [[The game|the game]] for players. Please keep any non-IC looking items from spoiling the view and ambiance of players. Please contact our trader liaison if you want any additional information about pedling.
## [[Conduct]]
All participants at Profound Decisions [[Events|events]], including all traders and caterers, must follow our guidelines for [[Conduct]] and [[Language|language]]. If you break the rules, even unknowingly, then you [[Will|will]] get a formal warning. Any subsequent breach of the rules [[Will|will]] result in you being refused entry to any future Profound Decisions [[Events|events]]. For this reason, it is essential that you ensure that you have read and understood all the conduct and language rules.
## Trader Liaison
Our trader liaisons exist to help with trading queries between and at [[Events|events]]. Their role is to be a first point of contact and ensure that we provide you with effective support so that you can trade successfully at our events. Our current trader liaisons are [mailto:angel@profounddecisions.co.uk Angel] and Tanis.
## Trade Items
Any items sold for OOC money at our events must comply with all standard legal requirements. For example, if you are selling hand-made soaps then they need to comply with the statutory regulations on testing and registration of your products.
### Weapon
Please remind all players that they must have weapons, shields, bows and arrows checked by a weapon checker before they use them at the event. They must not assume that an item automatically passes.
### Non IC Items
It is perfectly fine to sell items that do not fit [[The Empire|the Empire]] genre at our events, provided they are not on display at the front of the shop. Items that do not fit the game should only be displayed inside your tent or stall.
### Alcohol
Traders are not permitted to sell alcohol at events.
### Food
It is acceptable to sell cold or preserved food from your stall, but not hot or fresh cooked food. Caterers are covered by different rules and financial arrangements with PD, so traders are not allowed to offer major catering operations at events without prior agreement.
## Set up and Take-down
### Arrival
You may arrive on site at any time from the Wednesday before the event onwards. Traders are encouraged to come early and have their stalls set up before the players arrive, so there is no charge for early arrival for traders.
### Tents
All tents in the IC area must conform to the rules for tents published in the basic [[Costume]] guidelines. Specifically it is not possible to put dome tents or party tents in the IC area.
### [[Costume]]
All traders must wear [[Costume|costume]] that is suitable for [[The setting|the setting]] while in the IC area. 
### Departure
You may bring vehicles onto the site and begin taking your stall down as soon as the event ends at 3pm on the last [[Day|day]]. Please do not start taking your stall down before this time as it disrupts the event for players.
## Electricity
### Provision
Generators are not permitted in the IC area so we provide power to all traders with a pitch at the event. The price for this is included in the pitch fee, but you [[Will|will]] need to supply your own 25m extension cable. This power is intended to run lights and small low power utility devices - you cannot use our power supply for electrical heating at an event.
### Usage
Traders with a small pitch may have up to 200 watts, traders with a large pitch may have up to 400 watts. You cannot run a kettle, toaster or any electrical device that produces heat.
### Connections
Do not plug anything into any socket outlet until it has been checked by a member of the Profound Decisions electrical team. Electrical team members can be contacted via GOD or via the [[Event crew|event crew]] on the radio. Remember, there are a lot of traders and it may take a short period of time to get a member of the team to your location.
### Safety
If the PD crew electricians are not happy with the safety of a device then you [[Will|will]] not be allowed to use it. You [[Will|will]] not be able to use the device at the event and will need to secure any such items in your trader vehicle.
## Booking and Prices
### Account
To trade at our events your account on our website must be approved by our trader liaison. Once that is done you will be able to use the regular website to book tickets and a pitch to trade at events.
### Price
Every person who attends a Profound Decisions event must have a valid ticket - this includes yourself (if you are attending the event) and everyone who is working on your stall.
Please see the main Profound Decisions website for [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/event/Tickets ticket prices]. In addition you can purchase a pitch in the main trading area in the centre of the site. All normal ticket discounts apply for traders attending an event.
Pitch prices are £15 for a small pitch and £30 for a large pitch if booked during the 'early booking' period. The prices increase to £30 and £50 respectively if booked during the 'late booking period'. We do not accept requests to trade after the late booking period has ended.
### Pitch Sizes
A small pitch is up to 20m2, a large pitch is anything over this size. The size is taken from the sides of the tent, not the footprint of your guy ropes.
### Trade stall members
Please [[Contact us|contact us]] to book tickets for staff who are working your pitch. We will add the staff to your booking, which will ensure that your invoice is correct.
### VAT Invoices
A VAT invoice is automatically available from your Profound Decisions account for all bookings made using your account.
