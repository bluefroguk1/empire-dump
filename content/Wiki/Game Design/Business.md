## Definition
A business can represent almost any structure or property that could produce an income, such as inn, a smithy, a brothel, theatre or similar structure. It shouldn't be land or a farm - if that is what you want to take then we would recommend you choose the farm resource instead. But it can represent a trader who buys and sells goods within the Empire (if you want to represent a character who travels overseas to trade then choose a Fleet).
## Production
A business produces 9 crowns. This represents your disposable income each season; things like supporting your lifestyle, paying taxes, and the like all exist below the abstraction layer.
## Downtime Options
There are no downtime options for a business. It produces income automatically.
## Upgrades
A business can be upgraded using White granite obtained from the Bourse. Each time a business is upgraded, the owner receives an additional income of 36 rings from then on.
To upgrade a business requires Imperial wains of white granite equal to the level the business is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 business costs 2 Imperial wains of white granite, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.
## Diversification
A business can be diversified to sacrifice income for resources. To diversify a business costs 1 throne. Each time a business diversifies, the owner chooses one resource produced by a mine; the business produces 2 ingots of the chosen metal but produces 36 rings less income. 
Following the casting of the Empire wide Autumn enchantment it is possible for a business to diversify to gain two measures of a specific forest resource, 2 drams of a chosen herb, a dose of liao, or a single mana crystal. These additional diversification options represent specific trade agreements or changes to the way the business operates. These options will remain available for at least the start of the Summer Solstice 386YE, and potentially indefinitely assuming nothing significant changes.
## National Implications
Senators in the League are chosen on the basis of who can command the most support of individuals with substantial investments in the city. This is represented by the business personal resource. A League character who has been operating a business personal resource in a League city receives 10 votes for that city's senatorial elections. If a business is upgraded - then the character who operates that business receives 2 additional votes for each upgrade.

The table below shows a list of the rituals in Imperial lore which can affect the production of a business.
