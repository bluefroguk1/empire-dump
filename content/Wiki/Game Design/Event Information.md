## Overview
The following [[Event Information|event information]] is applicable for all our [[Events|events]]. Please feel free to point people to this page if they are looking for information on details for times, dates and other recurring event details.
## Tickets
When you book for an event the system [[Will|will]] try to email you a booking confirmation email with an attached pdf ticket. Please print the ticket out, or bring it with you on your phone if that's easier. If you don't use email, you can log in to your PD account and download your ticket at any time. You [[Will|will]] be asked to show your ticket when you arrive at the [[Gate|gate]].
If you are not sure if you are booked for the event, then you can check your booking status by logging in to [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/home your PD account] or by [mailto:admin@profounddecisions.co.uk emailing the head office].
Please make sure that you have entered your car registration number on your PD account if you are travelling by car.
If you have claimed the concessionary ticket price, please make sure that you email a copy of your proof of eligibility to the head office or bring a copy with you to the event.
## Arrival Times
Players are allowed on site from 13:00 hrs (1pm) on the Thursday before the event starts. There is an additional charge of £10 to arrive one [[Day|day]] early; this is paid on the gate and MUST be paid separately. There is a card reader, but the signal is variable so it may be quicker to pay with cash.
The gate [[Will|will]] close at approximately 10pm and [[Will|will]] open again at 10am on Friday morning. If you are arriving after this time, there [[Will|will]] be a number on the gate that you can call and security will open the gate to allow you in.
## Time in
Empire begins at 6pm on Friday and ends at 1 am that [[Night|night]]. On Saturday time in begins at 10 am and ends at 1am. 
On the last day of an event time in begins at 10 am and ends at 3pm. 
All players must be off site by the evening of the last day. 
## GOD and registration
GOD – [[The game|the Game]] Operations Desk – is a central out-of-character place for any queries, and a central PD contact point during [[Events|events]].
Before you go into play, you should go to GOD pick up your character pack. This includes your character passport – a description of the basic system information about your character – as well as your character's money, ribbons for any special items, and cards for mana crystals, [[Liao|liao]] and [[Herbs|herbs]].
GOD's typical opening hours will be:
* Thursday: 8pm–10pm
* Friday: 1pm–4pm and 5pm–1am
* Saturday: 10am–1am
* Sunday: 10am–5pm
These times – particularly on Thursday and Friday before time in – are subject to change according to crew needs and how our event preparations are going.
## Weapons Check
Bring your weapons to the weapon check point on the main road at the bottom end of the [[Highguard]] camp just down from GOD to get them checked by a Profound Decisions weapons checker before use. There will be a large grey [[Banner|banner]] on the tent to identify it. The best time to get your weapon checked is Friday day before the event starts where possible. 
If you are taking part in the [[Battles|battles]] then your weapons will need checking before each battle. The first time you get your weapon checked we will put a coloured rubber band coded for the event on it. On Saturday any weapon that isn't banded will be checked before it can be taken on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. On Sunday we will check all weapons before they go on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]].
Any weapon that fails a safety check will be tagged with a weapon-fail cable-tie and must be put stowed in an OOC area (or at GOD if you don't have access to any OOC area) until the end of the event.
## Telephone
For appropriate use only, our on-site mobile number is 07817 133793. This will be manned by Profound Decisions event team on the run up to the event, and held by our security team throughout the event. If you need to get hold of Profound Decisions to report an emergency then you can call this number.
## First Aid
