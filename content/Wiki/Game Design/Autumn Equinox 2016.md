## [[Battles]]
At the event we [[Will|will]] be running two large [[Jotun]] [[Battles|battles]], one Saturday morning and one Sunday morning. The large battles [[Will|will]] follow the normal rules for Battles; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one. The sides for the battles [[Will|will]] be chosen by the generals in the [[Muster]] of the [[Imperial Military Council]] on Friday [[Night|night]]. 
The fighting begins at 11:00 am - but if you are playing the battle then you [[Will|will]] need to [[Muster|muster]] up before this time and if you are [[Monstering|monstering]] then you need to make your way to the monster area for 10:00 am to give us time to get you into [[Costume|costume]], made-up and briefed.
Both these battles [[Will|will]] feature [[Jotun]] opponents - if you have any [[Costume|costume]] that is appropriate for the [[Jotun]] please bring that with you when you come to monster.

All [[The Nations|the nations]] are much bigger than the numbers listed - the numbers listed reflect the relative numerical strength of the nations not the actual number of fighters who take the field.
## [[Grendel]] Skirmish
For this event we have decided to try out a new approach to [[Monstering|monstering]]. As a result, rather than advertising a set of times that players could volunteer at - we are asking everyone who is enthusiastic to volunteer to help with some extra monstering to volunteer to play [[Grendel]] at 6:00pm on Saturday.
We want to stress that this is a request to people to volunteer - unlike the battles there is absolutely no obligation to volunteer to monster. But our hope is that enough players will volunteer to [[Fight|fight]] alongside our full time monster crew that we will be able to deliver a great skirmish at this time.
The skirmish is at
* 18:00 Saturday - [[Grendel]]
Of course anyone who wants to do some npcing will be welcome at any time - but 6pm Saturday is when we really need people - put the word around! The players will be fighting the [[Grendel]], so if you have any [[Grendel]] [[Costume|costume]] please bring it with you when you come. We expect the slot to last between 60 and 90 minutes at most.
## Caterers
* Mhorish
* Right Wok
* Applebys
There will be three caterers at the event, Mhorish will be providing a range of meals which are available from the IC or OOC field. In addition Right Wok will provide take-away dishes and Applebys will provide hot drinks from the catering area near the entrance to the IC field.
## Site Map
The site map is opposite; the camp coordinators for each camp will have their own layout for their camp, showing where all the tents they know about are to be pitched. If you do not know where you are supposed to be camping, then please speak to them on arrival at your nation's camp.
## Mobility Camp
The area marked with a wheelchair on the out-of-character camp is intended for participants with mobility needs. If you have genuine mobility needs then you can park your car here in the out-of-character camp - but still come and go throughout the event provided you have parked the car near the road. Please discuss with the crew if you have a disability that means you will need to camp here.
There are two disabled toilets at the event, one is part of the showers next to the disabled camp - the other is in the in-character field near [[Varushka]] and the [[Imperial Orcs]]. In addition there are two more disabled toilets in the shower units 750m away in the quiet camping field, if you are choosing to camp there.
