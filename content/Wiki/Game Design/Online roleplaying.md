## Overview
* Nobody is ever obliged to respond to communications sent between [[Events|events]] and you must not put that expectation on other players
It is important that the key in-character activity of [[The Empire|the Empire]] world takes place at [[Events|events]]. [[The game]] is busier and better if everything that can happen in the field, does happen in the field. Trade negotiations, religious debates, military planning, magical discourse and political discussions and appointments are all examples of activities that should happen at [[Events|events]]. For this reason, we generally discourage too much [[Downtime|downtime]] roleplaying between events and put strict limits on what can be done [[Online|online]] particularly using our forums and Facebook groups.
We know that many players enjoy sending and receiving in-character letters, but nobody is ever obliged to receive or respond to any communication like this. You must respect other participants and avoid putting any expectation on them to accept or respond to in-character letters.
## Avoid Contentious Claims
* If another character would want to rebut your claim - don't post it
You must take reasonable steps to avoid making contentious claims or statements in anything you post. It's fine to post details about your character, but you should avoid making claims for things being true which are not widely supported by [[The wiki|the wiki]]. The underlying goal is to avoid in-character conversations that are better had at events - so the acid test is if another character in Empire might reasonably want to post a rebuttal to your claim then we will take it down. 
So you can lay claim to be the Cardinal of Vigilance - if [[The wiki|the wiki]] acknowledges that you hold that title. But you shouldn't claim to be the favoured of Jaheris - because that's a contentious issue. You can claim to be a disciple of Jaheris - that's not something anyone can easily dispute - but you shouldn't claim that Jaheris is coming to save [[The Empire|the Empire]] from Eleonaris. That's not a statement of fact supported by [[The wiki|the wiki]].
## Do Not Push Agendas
* Do not promote your character's agendas
Empire is a game of player-vs-player politics - the key conflicts of [[The game|the game]] arise from [[Characters|characters]] who attend the event having competing agendas. Your agenda might be personal advancement - you might want to stand for Cardinal of Vigilance at the next event. It could be military - perhaps you want everyone to unit to drive the Jotun out of Sermersuaq. It might be religious - maybe you want to have the Axiou be publicly declared as heretics by the Synod.
All of these things are wonderful ambitions to have - they're part and parcel of what Empire is built to support. But if this kind of roleplaying shifts [[Online|online]] it will be to the detriment of [[The game|the game]]. So we take down anything which could reasonably constitute promoting a character's personal agenda, so that roleplaying can be saved for the field.
## Observe the [[Conduct]] Rules
* The normal [[Conduct|conduct]] rules apply at all times
The standard rules for [[Conduct]] at events apply to all posts made on our forums and facebook groups. Anything that breaks our [[Conduct|conduct]] rules will be taken down, so you must ensure that you follow the guidelines.
## Avoid Haggling or Agreeing Deals
* You may advertise in-character services provided you do not haggle [[Online|online]]
We believe that in-character announcements, such as those advertising a national event or offering an in-character service add more to the game for our players than they detract from it. It is fine to post an advert for a service offered by your character or group or for a meeting that you are arranging or similar, but if it isn't free to attend, then if you are using Facebook, you should use the [[Forums & Facebook|most appropriate nation group]] and/or the [https://www.facebook.com/groups/empirelrppromo Adverts and Promotion group] rather than the main Empire LRP discussion group.. 
There are several guidelines that we ask participant to follow when posting an advert of this kind:
* Don't invite price negotiating - You can state a price or leave one off, but haggling or negotiation over prices must be left to the field
* Do not add additional comments - Do not say “You see this poster across [[The Empire|the Empire]]". If you do this, you’re starting to narrate the reality of the world which is not permitted.
If possible, it is great if you can do both of the following: 
* Provide a plain text version - Beautiful posters and images are wonderful, but endeavour to provide a copy of the text alongside your image.
* Use the Hub - There’s a message board in The Hub which citizens can use - if you post online, please endeavour to also advertise in-character 
Empire has an active economy and the costs of resources can be a powerful lever with which to influence the world. Therefore, discussion about the trading costs of resources, or statements about what things ''should'' cost are prohibited.
## No Forums purely for IC roleplaying
*No IC forums for nations or Imperial political bodies
*Emails and group forums are fine
Our core goal is to ensure that important game decisions are taken at events, rather than between events. For this reason we are asking players not to create IC forums for one of the [[Nation overview|ten nations]] or for any of the core Imperial political bodies - the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]], [[Imperial Synod|Synod]], [[Imperial Bourse|Bourse]], [[Imperial Military Council|Military Council]] and the [[Imperial Conclave|Conclave]].
Although it is fine to send IC communications by email or use forums for groups, we would ask that you don't engage in important IC discussions of the kinds listed above unless you are at an event. It is ok to advertise IC services on the most appropriate nation Facebook group or the [https://www.facebook.com/groups/empirelrppromo Adverts and Promotions group], provided you don't then get drawn into IC negotiations with other players for those services. Please save this for when everyone is in-character at the event.
## In-Character Emails
* It is fine to send emails as in-character letters
* You may use the forums to request email contacts
It is fine to send emails to players representing letters you have sent to their character. In-character letters should be sent privately - but you can use our social media to request contact details for individual [[Characters|characters]] you have met, or have a way of getting in touch with (eg specific Imperial title-holders, individual group leaders) to get in touch for separate IC letters. We ask people not to tag players of sought-after [[Characters|characters]] directly, in order that they can decide for themselves whether they want to engage - see if people they know can show them your post. 
Although it is fine to send IC communications by email or use forums for groups, we would ask that you don't engage in important IC discussions of the kinds listed above unless you are at an event. Please save this for when everyone is in-character at the event.
## In-Character Documentation
* Other players are free to make in-character phys-reps of any in-character material you publish
If you send an email to another character that is an in-character letter then they are free to turn that into an actual in-character document, the phys-rep of the letter they have received from your character. Likewise, if you publish an in-character announcement on the forums or facebook groups, or if you post an in-character advert then any player can turn that into an in-character document and use it at the events if they wish to.
## Communication with NPCs
*You cannot send winged messengers between events
*We ask our NPCs not to send IC communications between events
You are welcome to send IC communications to egregores and Anvil civil servants between events but all our staff have been asked not to respond until the next event. They may ''choose'' to bring such IC communications with them to the next event and act on them there.
Rituals cannot be performed in [[Downtime|downtime]] so you cannot perform [[Call Winged Messenger]] unless you are at an event.
Please also appreciate that our crew are all volunteers. While they may choose to respond to questions, Profound Decisions do not expect crew to handle any OOC communications between events. If you need a response, please email Profound Decisions instead.
