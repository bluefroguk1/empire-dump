## Battles
At the event we will be running two large battles, one Saturday morning and one Sunday morning. The large battles will follow the normal rules for Battles; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one. The sides for the battles will be chosen by the Generals in the [[Muster]] of the [[Imperial Military Council]] on Friday night. Each of the two battles must have at least 104 and at most 111 force weight sent on it.
We will update this page with the battle force weightings soon.
The [[Sentinel Gate]] opens at 11:00 am - regardless of whether anyone is ready or not! If you are playing then make sure you arrive in plenty of time before this so your weapons can be checked.
If you are monstering then you need to make your way to the monster area between 9:30 and 10:00 am to give us time to get you into [[Costume]], made-up and briefed. If you turn up after 10:30 you will be turned away.
The winds of war now provide information about the battle opportunities at the forthcoming event.
## Dusk
* For this event we are defining dusk as beginning at 20:50 and ending at 21:50
* No bow or crossbow use in [[Anvil]] after 20:50 or on quests that start after this time
Our bow safety rules prohibit the use of bows and crossbows after "dusk" begins. At this event we are defining that point as 20:50 each day. This means you cannot use a bow in Anvil after this time, or on a skirmish or quest that starts after this time.
The necromantic ritual [[Whispers through the Black Gate]] can only be performed for one hour around dusk - at this event that means the ritual can be performed at any time between 20:50 and 21:50.
## Toilets
Toilet blocks are marked on the map with a T symbol. The main blocks are the ones near Mhorish, near God, and in the OOC player field adjacent to the crew area. All the larger blocks of toilet and hygiene facilities that are located around the site are split into male, female and gender neutral toilets. All our participants are entitled to use the facilities that they feel most comfortable using. You must not [[Challenge]] other participants when using the facilities.
## Site Map
The site map is opposite; the Camp pLanner for each camp will have their own layout for their camp, showing where all the tents they know about are to be pitched. If you are bringing an IC tent, please make sure you contact your camp planner before the event to let them know what you are bringing. If you do not know where you are supposed to be camping, then please speak to the Camp planner on arrival at your nation's camp.
## [[Accessibility]] Camps
The areas marked with a wheelchair are the out-of-character camps that are for use by participants with additional accessiblity needs. We have increased the size of the main accessibility camp opposite the Marcher camp this year to try to ensure that there is enough space for everyone. In addition we will try to manage the space to allow participants with accessibility needs who are not stopping on site to park here when they come and go each day. Please let the crew know if you need to camp or park here.
There are five disabled toilet facilities, one near monster, one near each accessibility camp and one in the in-character area in the toilet blocks opposite Mhorish.
## Drop Off Point
No vehicles are allowed on site after 6pm on Friday as the game has started by this point. We have created a vehicle drop off point near the main entrance to [[The League]] and Navarr camp. This is purely for vehicles that are not driving onto the site but wish to park as close to the entrance as possible so that they can unload from here. You must move your vehicle from the drop off point to the main camping/parking area once you have finished unloading your vehicle.
