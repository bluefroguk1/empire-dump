## Overview
A number of people now hire bell tents from Tent Hire companies for Events. These are hired from various companies who come to site and put up the tents and return to site and remove them after the event. This document is some guidance for hirers, camp pLanners and the hire companies.
## The Hirers
If you are hiring a tent from a tent rental company you are responsible for making sure the rental company knows the requirements for putting up tents on our site and them being in the correct location.
You need to supply information to the hire company for the camp planner to be able to identify your tent on the map when the rental company arrive onsite. This could include a map reference, a group and character name and any other Out of Character/In Character details. More information is better!
If these tents are going up in the In Character area they need to be booked in with the camp planners. The camp planners need to know the number and size of the tents, that they are rental tents and which rental company is supplying them.
When the camp plan is finalised, you are responsible for making sure the hire company knows where the tent is being located and the requirements for when they can come on site and process onsite.
## The Camp Planners
If you are a camp planner, you should have hire tents indicated to you when booked by the hirers. 
When the hire company arrive on site they should report into you and be directed where to pitch by you.
## Hire Companies
If you are a hire company, we expect the person who has hired a tent from you to have communicated with you about the area the tent(s) need to be pitched in.
You can come onto site to pitch tents from 1pm Thursday. When you reach site you need to report to the camp planner for the nation area you are pitching in. If you are pitching in one of the [[General]] or accessible camping areas, the traffic team will direct you to the location to pitch in.
Space in the nation camps is very restricted and tents need to be pitched as closely as possible with guy ropes crossing to maximise space. Pitching in any other ways causes knock on problems for the rest of the site.
You may come onto site after 3pm on Sunday to take the tents down but they must be removed by Monday evening.
