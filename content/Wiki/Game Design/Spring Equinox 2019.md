## Battles
At the event we will be running two large battles, one Saturday morning and one Sunday morning. The large battles will follow the normal rules for Battles; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one. The sides for the battles will be chosen by the Generals in the [[Muster]] of the [[Imperial Military Council]] on Friday night. 
The [[Sentinel Gate]] opens at 11:00 am - regardless of whether anyone is ready or not! If you are playing then make sure you arrive in plenty of time before this so your weapons can be checked.
If you are monstering then you need to make your way to the monster area between 9:30 and 10:00 am to give us time to get you into [[Costume]], made-up and briefed. If you turn up after 10:30 you will be turned away.
At this event, the best estimate of the Fighting strength of each nation provided by the civil service is as follows. of their options, which nations could take [[The Battlefield]] together. Each of the two battles must have at least 81 and at most 84 force weight sent on it.
## Site Map
The site map is opposite; the camp coordinators for each camp will have their own layout for their camp, showing where all the tents they know about are to be pitched. If you do not know where you are supposed to be camping, then please speak to them on arrival at your nation's camp.
