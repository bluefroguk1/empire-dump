## Artisan
*4-point skill

Every artificer can also make, and apply, Artisan's Oil, a special preparation that can [[Mend|mend]] broken items.
Rare materials are produced by mines and forests, which are personal resources.
You may also bond any item that you can make to a willing person. A character can only use a [[Magical Item|magical item]] if it is bonded to the wielder.
When you choose this skill you can pick four magical items that your character is able to create. The choices you can make are limited as described below. The character creation system is set up to enforce these restrictions automatically.
