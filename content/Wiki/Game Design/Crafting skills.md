## Artisan
*4-point skill
*You must purchase this skill before you can take any other [[Crafting skills|crafting skills]]
During the [[Downtime|downtime]] between [[Events|events]], you may craft up to three [[Magical Items]] using rare [[Materials]] that you have in your possession. The [[Materials|materials]] are used up to create the item. You may only craft items that you know how to make. Every artificer can also make, and apply, [[Artisan's Oil]], a special preparation that can mend broken items.
Rare [[Materials|materials]] are produced by mines and forests, which are [[Resource#Personal Resource|personal resources]].
You may also bond any item that you can make to a willing person. A character can only use a magical item if it is bonded to the wielder.
When you choose this skill you can pick four magical items that your character is able to create. The choices you can make are limited as described below. The character creation system is set up to enforce these restrictions automatically.
### Apprentice Item
The item you choose for your first slot must require no special [[Materials|materials]] to make. All these items take two months of [[Downtime|downtime]], rather than needing any special materials. If you take the artisan skill at character creation you will receive one of these items at the first event your character attends, with three [[Events|events]] to run before it expires. You can expand the table below to see a list of items you can choose as your apprentice item.

You can expand the table below to see a list of items you can choose as your journeyman item.
