## Overview
Empire [[Events|events]] are split into two areas, the out-of-character area which isn't used during [[The game|the game]] where you can pitch any style of tent, and in-character area where [[The game|the game]] takes place and where you can only pitch an appropriate in-character tent. The in-character area is further sub-divided into ten distinct camps, one for each nation. If you are bringing an in-character tent, then you must camp with the other members of your nation.
Each nation has one or more camp planners, members of crew whose job is to plan the layout of each camp. Anyone who is planning to camp in the in-character area must contact the [[Camp planner|camp planner]] to let them know how many tents they are bringing and how large they are. The camp planners use this information to create a camp plan for each nation, indicating where all their nation's tents [[Will|will]] go.
The camp planners publish the camp plan a week before the event. You must camp in the spot indicated on the plan. The [[Camp planner|camp planner]] [[Will|will]] be available on Thursday and Friday before the event starts to provide help and guidance to find your spot if you need it.

## Camp Planning
* If you are camping in-character, you must let the camp planner for your nation know
* Camp planners can be contacted on Facebook or by email
* The deadline for providing information is two weeks before the event begins
* You need to tell your camp planner the number and size of any tents you are bringing
* You must let them know if the tents you are bringing are required or optional
* Camp planners aim to publish the camp plan for the event one week before it begins
* Only contact your own nation's camp planner about the camp plan for the event
If you are planning to pitch one or more tents in the in-character area at the event, you must let the camp planner for you nation know well beforehand. This may be as simple as filling in a row on a public spreadsheet, but it varies from nation to nation. You need to contact the camp planner, either on Facebook or by email, and let them know the number and size of any tents you are bringing.
Our camp planners are all members of the relevant nation Facebook group. They will post there 4-6 weeks before each event, to remind people to let them know what tents they are bringing. You can also contact them via their official Profound Decisions email accounts. All contact details are below.
If you are planning to bring tents you want to pitch in the in-character area then you must let us know two weeks before the event to ensure that space is allocated for them. You will need to let your camp planner know which of the tents you are bringing are required and which are optional (see below) so that they can allocate the space available accordingly. The camp planners for each nation will publish a camping map on the nation's Facebook group one week before the event and will send this by email to anyone who requests it.
All our camp planners work together, collaboratively, to produce a single camp plan for the event. Please only contact your own nation camp planner about the camp plan. If there any issues that you think could affect neighbouring camps, then discuss those with your camp planner. They will share any relevant issues with the camp planning team.
## Optional and Required Tents
* Required tents include all tents for roleplaying in and any tents that need to be on the IC field for any [[Accessibility|accessibility]] reason (mobility, fatigue, childcare, etc)
* Optional tents include any tents that could move to an OC field if required because they are just used for sleeping or storing equipment and aren’t needed for any [[Accessibility|accessibility]] reason
* You won’t be asked to justify or explain your choices - just mark your tent as optional or required with your camp planner
* If we run out of space, camp planners will more some or all of the sleeping tents labelled as optional to the adjacent overflow fields
There are new rules in operation for in-character camping in 2023. When you let your camp planner know what tents you are planning to bring, you must let them know which tents are required and which are optional. Required tents are all tents for roleplaying in and any tents that need to be on the in-character field for any accessibility reason (mobility, fatigue, childcare, etc). Optional tents include any tents that could move to an OC field if required because they are just used for sleeping or storing equipment and aren’t needed for any accessibility reason. You won’t be asked to justify or explain your choices - just let the camp planner know if the tent as optional or required as appropriate.
If we run out of space, then our camp planners will move some or all of the sleeping tents labelled as optional to the adjacent overflow fields. These fields are not in-character and don't form part of the [[Anvil]] game area, but they are adjacent to [[Anvil]] to keep walking distances to a minimum. If we only need to move a few tents, then we will ensure we aren't moving the same tents each time.
## Camp Setup
* You must make sure you camp in the indicated area
* Your camp planner can show you the area that has been allocated for you to pitch your in-character tents when you arrive at the event
You must ensure that you keep your camp to the area designated by the camp planner. You can liaise with the camp planner once you arrive on site before you pitch any in-character tents to confirm where you should camp and how much room you have available.
## During the Event
* All our camp planners play the event, in an emergency they can try to direct you to the most suitable member of our [[Event crew|event crew]]
* Camp planning is a purely out-of-character responsibility, it has nothing to do with the character they play
All our camp planners are members of our site team. This means that they carry out their responsibilities before and after the event, not while the event is running. Once the event begins, they are just like every other participant who is [[Playing the game|playing the game]]. In an emergency your camp planner can try to direct you to the most suitable member of our [[Event crew|event crew]] who can help, but the best place to get help is usually your nation [[Egregore]], or a wandering [[Referee|referee]], or to ask at GOD.
It is important to keep in mind that our camp planners are treated as players during the event. They are not NPCs and their out-of-character responsibilities as camp planners are completely separate from the in-character goals and objects of their [[Characters|characters]]. Please don't confuse the two and definitely don't try and offer them in-character bribes to get the spot you want!
## Camp Takedown
* Camp planners will remind players pitching in the in-character area to clear their camp at the end of the weekend
* Your camp planner can provide advice on how to dispose of your rubbish and will have spare rubbish bags if you need them
You must make sure you clear all your rubbish at the end of the weekend and put it in one of the skips provided. Your camp planner will remind you to clear your camp before the end of the weekend. They can tell you where the skips are located and provide advice on the best way to dispose of your rubbish if you need any help. They also have spare refuse bags available if you need them to bag your rubbish.
## Accessibility
* Please make sure your camp planners is aware of any accessibility needs you have
* Please make sure your camp planner is aware of any other out-of-character issues you have
* If your accessibility needs include electricity for a CPAP machine, please contact admin to let them know
Your camp position can have a huge impact on practical accessibility issues. Please make sure that your camp planner is aware of any accessibility needs that you have - they will do their best to take those into account when assigning you a camp position. Likewise if you have any other out-of-character issues that affect where you need to camp at the event, such as a [[Conduct|conduct]] problem with another player, then you can speak to your camp planner and they will try to choose a suitable pitch accordingly. If for any reason you don't want to speak to your camp planner about your issue, then you can contact anyone at Profound Decisions to discuss the matter.
If you need electricity for CPAP machines or similar then please email [mailto:admin@profounddecisions.co.uk admin@profounddecisions.co.uk] and they will liaise with our electricians team to see what options we have.
## Collaboration
* Our camp planners work together to collaborate to produce a single camp plan for the event
* Producing any camp plan inevitably involves a lot of compromises
* Please respect the hard work the camp planner do and the decisions they have taken
Our camp planners collaborate to create a single camp plan for the whole event. Their first priority is to ensure that [[The Key|the key]] out-of-character needs of our players are met, followed by the comfort and enjoyment of their nation as a whole. Inevitably, the are compromises that have to be made when placing tents, so not everyone can have the spot they want. You are welcome to submit requests and make suggestions but please respect the hard work the camp planners do. The camp plan, unless it affects your access requirements, is final.
