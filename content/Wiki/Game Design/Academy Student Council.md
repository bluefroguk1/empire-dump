The Academy Student Council draws its members from students attending the Imperial Academy. One member is elected from each nation. It serves both as an educational experience in the political processes of the Empire and as a decision-making body on behalf of all Academy students.
The council's activities are overseen by the Advisor to the Student Council, a member of the Academy Faculty who advises the council on how they may further the motions and goals presented in council meetings.
There is no age limit to who can be a councillor but they must have passed their Test of Citizenship. This demonstrates their ability to engage with the game world in an IC manner and understand how to make the most of the Student Council. 
### Elections
Elections are held twice a year, at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes. Any student attending the Academy may put themselves forward. If there is more than one candidate then elections for each nation are conducted according to national traditions. Each Student Councillor may appoint a proxy. Guardians are asked to register any candidate with the Academy Staff on the Friday of the event.
### Meeting times
The Student Council meets at 1100 on the Sat and Sun of each event in the Senate. Meetings are conducted by a Speaker for the Senate or a member of the Academy. Council members may arrange informal meetings prior to this to discuss any Council business.
### Powers
The council's powers are designed to empower the students to make decisions about the use of resources available to the Academy. 
Councillors may present one motion at each meeting. If passed, the Faculty will make all efforts to see that the motion is carried out. Previous motions have included the construction of Magic Items for the use of the Academy or as gifts to worthy people or groups, donations in support of organisations such as the Anvil Hospital, and suggestions for new classes or activities.
