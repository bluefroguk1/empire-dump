## Overview
Profound Decisions is a professional [[Live roleplaying|live roleplaying]] company dedicated to producing high quality [[Events|events]]. However the majority of crew that you encounter at an event are volunteers who have freely given up their time to make the event more enjoyable for everyone. Please respect their generosity and do not ask them to receive complaints. Please remember that this is their hobby too. We require our players to be civil towards all members of the volunteer crew at all times.
If you do have a complaint or a concern then please go to GOD and ask to speak to the appropriate member of the [[Profound Decisions management team]]. If you aren't sure who to speak to, then please ask to speak to Matt Pennington. The management team are all employees of Profound Decisions whose job it is to deal with any serious problems that you have. If an issue is serious or distressing then we would urge you to bring it to our attention as early as possible. We will try to promptly resolve any problems that arise.
