## Definition
A [[Mana site|mana site]] represents a location where flows of [[Magic|magic]] are particularly strong. A practised individual can use solutions of rare salts placed strategically throughout the area to cause mana crystals to form. The flows of [[Magic|magic]] tend to move as they ebb and flow so the methods used to catch them must be continuously adjusted. Many different methods of measuring or focusing the natural flows of [[Magic|magic]] are used, the most common being mirrors, geometric solids, lenses, and objects such as windchimes whose movements can be interpreted to determine any adjustments that need to be made.
## Production
A [[Mana site|mana site]]  produces 7 [[Game items#Mana Crystals|mana crystals]].
Total Money SpentAdditional Crystals
43 rings1 crystal mana 
108 rings2 crystal mana
194 rings3 crystal mana
302 rings4 crystal mana
-->
## [[Downtime]] Options
A [[Mana site|mana site]] produces mana automatically. For a time it was possible to obtain additional crystals from a mana site by using the rare alchemical product known as the [[Better world#The White Seed|White Seed]]. This material was only available from the [[Principalities of Jarm]], and with the collapse of relations between the two nations it is no longer available.
## Upgrades
A mana site can be upgraded using [[Mithril]] obtained from the Bourse. The first time a mana site is upgraded, the owner receives one additional mana crystals from then on, the second time a mana site is upgraded, the owner receives two additional mana crystals. Production increases continue to alternate in this way every time the mana site is upgraded.
To upgrade a mana site requires Imperial wains of mithril equal to the level the mana site is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 mana site costs 2 Imperial wains of mithril, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.
## Diversification
A mana site cannot be diversified.
## Rituals
The table below shows a list of the rituals in both Imperial lore and Urizen lore which can affect the production of a mana site.
