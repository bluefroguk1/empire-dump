## Description
Also known as ''bright mandrake'' in the western regions of [[The Empire|the Empire]] and as ''gatebloom'' in pre-Imperial texts, [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]] is a very rare plant that has a propensity for reacting to certain types of [[Magic|magic]]. The plant is found growing in the wild around regios, unharvested crystalline mana, and other strange occult confluences, absorbing the ambient magical energies they emit; it is notorious for being extremely hard to cultivate in a garden or other controlled environment. Each individual mandrake flowers once every six years, blooming into vivid, colourful blossoms that indicate the herb is at its most potent. Once dug up, the magically-infused root of a flowering plant can be ground up into a paste that has a dramatic narcotic effect on the lineaged. The root smells earthy even when washed and cleaned, but has a zesty, refreshing note to it as well. Some herbalists draw comparisons between the appearance of [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]] and bladeroot and consider the two plants to be related.
