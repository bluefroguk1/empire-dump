## Description
Also known as ''bright mandrake'' in the western regions of [[The Empire|the Empire]] and as ''gatebloom'' in pre-Imperial texts, [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]] is a very rare plant that has a propensity for reacting to certain types of [[Magic|magic]]. The plant is found growing in the wild around regios, unharvested crystalline mana, and other strange occult confluences, absorbing the ambient magical energies they emit; it is notorious for being extremely hard to cultivate in a garden or other controlled environment. Each individual mandrake flowers once every six years, blooming into vivid, colourful blossoms that indicate the [[Herb|herb]] is at its most potent. Once dug up, the magically-infused root of a flowering plant can be ground up into a paste that has a dramatic narcotic effect on the lineaged. The root smells earthy even when washed and cleaned, but has a zesty, refreshing note to it as well. Some herbalists draw comparisons between the appearance of [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]] and [[Bladeroot|bladeroot]] and consider the two plants to be related.
Most [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]] in [[The Empire|the Empire]] is acquired and sold on the public [[Bourse]] auction. Imperial herbal knowledge is not sufficient for [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]] to be widely grown in [[Herb garden|herb garden]] personal resources, or for [[Herb|herb]] gardens to diversify into it, outside of specific and unusual circumstances.
The [[Ritual|ritual]] Madyn's Gift can be used to create additional [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]]. During the formulation of that ritual, further information about the peculiar magical plant was uncovered.
