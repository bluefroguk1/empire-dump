## Definition
A [[Farm|farm]] can represent almost any type of [[Farm|farm]] or agricultural holding. It could be vineyards, orchards of fruit or more prosaically sheep, cattle or crops. It shouldn't be a [[Forest|forest]] or wood - if that is what you want to take then we would recommend you choose the [[Forest]] [[Resource|resource]] instead.
The size of a [[Farm|farm]] can vary dramatically, depending on how productive the land is and what crops are grown, a normal size for a [[Farm|farm]] would be around twenty acres but an orchard might be much smaller, only a few acres, while a sheep [[Farm|farm]] on the [[Urizen]] hills could easily be ten times this size.
## Production
A farm produces 9 crowns. This represents your disposable income each season; things like supporting your lifestyle, paying taxes, and the like all exist below the [[Abstraction|abstraction]] layer.
## [[Downtime]] Options
There are no [[Downtime|downtime]] options for a farm. It produces income automatically.
## Upgrades
A farm can be upgraded using [[Weirwood]] obtained from [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. Each time a farm is upgraded, the owner receives an additional income of 36 rings from then on.
To upgrade a farm requires Imperial wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] equal to the level the farm is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 farm costs 2 Imperial wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.
## Diversification
A farm can be diversified to sacrifice income for resources or [[Herbs|herbs]]. To diversify a farm costs one [[Throne|throne]]. Each time a farm diversifies, the owner chooses one resource produced by a [[Forest]] or a single [[Herb]]; the farm produces 2 measures of the chosen natural material or two drams of the [[Herb|herb]] but produces 36 rings less income. If a [[Herb|herb]] is chosen it must be one of the standard five herbs available from a [[Herb garden]].
A Marcher farm owner in a Marcher [[Territory|territory]] has a special diversification option as long as the [[Imperial Conclave]] continues to interdict the [[Rivers Run Red]] [[Ritual|ritual]]. With the aid of the landskeepers, they can raise menhirs that [[Will|will]] allow their farm to produce a small amount of crystal mana.  They [[Will|will]] lose 30 rings of income as a result, but the farm [[Will|will]] produce one mana crystal for each level of this diversification. It costs one throne each time they diversify in this way. The landskeepers have made it clear that this help [[Will|will]] be withdrawn if [[The Conclave|the Conclave]] remove the [[Interdiction|interdiction]]. If this happens, the option to build new stones would disappear, although any menhirs already built - any diversification that was complete - would be unaffected.
## National Implications
Senators in [[The Marches]] are chosen by the [[Steward|steward]] who controls the most land; this is represented by the farm personal resource. A Marcher character who has been operating a farm personal resource in a Marcher territory has 10 votes towards the election of the [[Steward|steward]] for the territory. If the farm is upgraded - then the character who operates that farm contributes 2 additional votes for each upgrade.
## [[Rituals]]
