## Overview
[[Photography]] in LRP is a compromise: on the one hand are the rights of attendees who do not wish to be photographed coupled with the impact on immersion for all players by the photographer's presence. On the other hand many players wish to enjoy a photographic record of their character and the [[Events|events]] they attended and photographs can help to publicize, promote and improve a game. These guidelines are intended to set a balance between these compromises which we feel is appropriate for Profound Decisions [[Events|events]].
We ask that photographers do not release their photographs under a Creative Commons license or similar, since this [[Will|will]] give up any rights they would have to pass along take-down requests to those who have used their photos. They are, of course, free to grant usage rights to third parties, but should retain as much ability to enforce take-down requests as they feasibly can when doing so.
## Rules for Photographers
These rules apply to all photographers, players and crew at our events. Tom Garnett is in charge of [[Photography|photography]] at our events. Please use [mailto:photography@profounddecisions.co.uk photography@profounddecisions.co.uk] for all inquiries about photography at our events.
### Minimizing the Damage to Immersion
*Wear [[Costume|costume]] whenever you are in an IC area
*No flash photography on the IC field
*Avoid standing in player's line of sight when shooting
*If possible cover your camera to make it as unobtrusive as possible
*Do not stage shots with players on the IC field
Everyone who is taking photographs at events needs to take all possible steps to minimize the damage to immersion that their OOC presence causes. In line with the normal PD event rules, you must wear [[Costume|costume]] when you are in the IC area. In addition you should try to cover your camera if possible. Flash photography isn't permitted in the IC areas, nor is staging shots with players. If you need to use a flash or stage a shot then please do so from the OOC field.
The most important thing is to try and remain "outside the focus" of [[The game|the game]]. If a verbal clash is occurring, then you should not be between the participants and other players; if a battle is occurring then you should be well away from the lines of combatants. This [[Will|will]] limit the range of photographs that you can take at the event, but is a compromise that we require all photographers to make to ensure that you avoid being in the line of sight of players who are trying to roleplay while you are taking photographs.
## Sale of Photographs
* Do not sell photographs outside the LRP community without the express permission of the people in the photo
Photographing at PD events is undertaken on the understanding that while you may freely sell your work within the larp community - and to their friends and [[Family|family]] - you shall not sell photographs more widely without the explicit permission of the identifiable major subjects.
This is intended to balance the interests of photographers against the ability of participants to control how they are portrayed to the wider world. Any questions about this policy, or how it applies to specific situations, should be addressed to PD by email.
### Take-down Requests
*All photographers must take reasonable steps to respect player's privacy
*You must take down any photograph that you are asked to remove by a subject in the photo
Not all participants at an LRP event are fortunate enough to be unconcerned about images of themselves dressed in costume appearing on the internet. Given the size of [[The game|the game]] it is impossible to maintain an effective list of individuals who do not wish to be photographed, but all photographers should take reasonable steps to try to avoid photographing players they know do not wish images of them live-roleplaying to be made public.
In particular photographers must remove any image that they have published, if they are requested to do so by a participant who is identifiable in the photograph, as quickly as practical. Any photographers who do not remove photographs when requested will have their right to attend future PD events permanently revoked.
## Filming
* We do not allow filming by outside organizations at our events without prior permission
* You may not film other participants in the IC area during time-in
* You must have the consent of anyone you film; you may never film covertly at our events
Commercial TV production outfits are not permitted to film at our events without our prior consent. Live role-players and film-students or enthusiasts are permitted to film explicitly consenting subjects in areas that are not in-character - we anticipate this being used for things like reaction videos, and one-to-one interviews. 
All requests for permission to film participants engaged in live-roleplaying at our events will be refused. Our goal is to minimize any disruption to immersion and to ensure that all participants are able to attend the event in the knowledge that Profound Decisions have done everything possible to ensure that they are not filmed without their consent. As a result covert filming of any part of the event is not permitted.
The one case where filming within the IC area may be allowed is where a person or group wishes to record an out-of-character "piece to camera" about their event, in private, and the most suitable space available is their own tent (in the in-character field). Since this will risk neither disrupting the game, nor capturing the roleplay of other participants, we will usually be happy to grant permission provided that we know what you are planning.
As with all rules, if you are uncertain about how they might apply to your specific case, we strongly encourage you to [[Contact us|contact us]] and discuss your situation.
## Audio Recordings
* Make sure you minimise the damage to immersion as much as possible
* You must honour all reasonable take-down requests
You may record audio at Profound Decisions games, subject to the same considerations around minimising disruption to the game as apply to photography. Equipment should be kept as unobtrusive as is feasibly possible. It is never acceptable to stage scenes, or to ask third parties to move or quieten, for the sake of a recording on the in-character field.
If someone's voice is distinct and identifiable in an audio recording that you have published, and they ask you to take it down, then you must do so - in line with our policy on photographs.
## Crew Photographers
*There are two crew photographers at our events
*Our crew photography department allocates photography slots for [[Battles|battles]] and skirmishes
Tom Garnett and Oliver Facey attend our events as part of our crew to take photographs. Their goal is to  produce photographs of the event to help promote and improve the game. We do not require any further crew photographers at this time.
If you wish to take photographs on a battle or skirmish then you must [mailto:photography@profounddecisions.co.uk email the crew photographers] to see if a slot is free.
## Player Photographers
*All other photographers attending the event must purchase a ticket
Everyone who has purchased a ticket to attend the event is welcome to take photographs in the main IC area if they wish to do so, provided that they follow the rules for photographers at our events. 
## Battle and Skirmish Photography
*Slots to photograph the [[Battles|battles]] and skirmishes are allocated by our crew photographers
*Photographing a battle is not an alternative to [[Monstering|monstering]]
We have chosen to limit the number of slots available for players taking to [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] to take photographs in an attempt to ensure that the battles and skirmishes remain as immersive as possible. If you wish to take photographs on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] then please [mailto:photography@profounddecisions.co.uk email us] to request access.
Two slots will be used on most battles by our crew photographers - if they are not photographing a battle or skirmish then additional slots will become free. 
Photographing a battle is not considered an alternative to [[Monstering|monstering]]. If players wish to [[Fight|fight]] in a battle as their character they will still need to monster a battle as well.
