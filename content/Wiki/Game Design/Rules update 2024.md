## Overview
Every year we carry out a review of some part of [[The game|the game]] looking to see what we improve. This page summarizes and explains the changes so that players can identify and understand the changes easily. We try to include a section after each update to explain the reasoning behind the change, as well as providing a in-character rationale for what has changed where appropriate.
## Artificial Intelligence
* Content generated using Artificial Intelligence cannot be used at Empire [[Events|events]]
Content that is made using generative-AI tools (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) cannot be used in the field at Empire. It is fine for digital artists to use procedural tools to create art for [[The game|the game]], but images manufactured by AI art engines must not be used in-character. Likewise, writers can use modern tools to proof their writing, but any substantial block of prose that is generated using a large-[[Language|language]] model or any equivalent AI tool must not be used in-character. We also ask people not to post images, video or text created using generative-AI to our forums or Facebook [[Groups|groups]].
### Reasoning
Empire is a game of hard [[Skills|skills]] by design - we want success in Empire to derive primarily from your abilities as a player to a large extent. This is why we have always asked people not to play recorded [[Music|music]] at [[Events|events]]: we want to highlight the role of the many skilled IC musicians in [[Anvil]].
To be consistent with that approach we've decided to ban the use of all AI generated content in-character. Human creativity is at the heart of Empire - we want our game to showcase the abilities of the artists and writers who create art for the game - we're not interested in creating [[Events|events]] for machines to attend. 
We've also chosen to prohibit the posting of generative-AI content on our forum and in our Facebook groups. These groups are very busy already and generative content adds little value. It is also ethically contentious and invariably leads to unproductive arguments about the use of AI, rather than positive discussions about Empire. This is not a [[Conduct|conduct]] issue; players are welcome to post Empire content that is generated using AI to their own walls. This rule only limits what is used at [[Events|events]] and what is posted in our social media spaces.
