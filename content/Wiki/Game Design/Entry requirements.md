## Overview
We encourage everyone who is attending a Profound Decisions Empire event to take a COVID test before they travel. If you have any COVID symptoms, then you must have recently had a negative COVID test result to attend the event. If not, you will not be permitted to enter the event.
Additional COVID safety measures will be in place for all events in 2023, we will review some of these measures before each event and update them based on the current situation.
## Using a COVID Test
* We encourage everyone to take an LFT on the day of travel, even if you have no symptoms
* You must take a COVID test if you have any new symptoms, even if you are vaccinated
* We cannot supply lateral flow (LFT) COVID test kits at the event
We encourage everyone attending an event in 2023 to take an LFT on the day of travel, even if you have no symptoms. If you develop any new and unexplained symptoms in the last seven days then you must take an LFT on the day you are starting your travel to the event. You may only attend the event if you get a negative test response. These rules apply to participants of all ages. [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/ Relevant symptoms] include:
* a high temperature or shivering (chills) – a high temperature means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
* a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours
* a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste
* shortness of breath
* feeling tired or exhausted
* an aching body
* a headache
* a sore throat
* a blocked or runny nose
* loss of appetite
* diarrhoea
* feeling sick or being sick
If you develop any of the above symptoms while you are at the event, then you will need to isolate until you can take an LFT. If this test is positive then you must go home as soon as it is practical to do so and make all reasonable attempts to isolate until then. If this happens then let us know as soon as possible and we will switch your booking to complimentary. The entire cost of your ticket will be fully refunded to your account, but you will still qualify as having attended, so you will still be eligible to submit a downtime and receive XP benefits as if you had attended the event normally.
Please don't bring your LFT test with you, our gate staff will simply ask you if you have any COVID symptoms and to confirm that you have taken an LFT test that day and that you have not newly tested positive in the last seven days.
There will not be COVID tests available at the event. You must acquire your own test and complete it before you arrive if you have any COVID symptoms.
## If You Test Positive For COVID
* Do not attend the event if you have newly tested positive for COVID in the last seven days
* If you are booked for the event email us to let us know you cannot attend due to COVID
* After the event, your ticket will be fully refunded. You will still receive XP and be eligible for downtime as usual
If you newly test COVID positive at any point in the seven days before the event begins then you must not attend the event. Please [mailto:admin@profounddecisions.co.uk email admin] to let us know that you are unable to attend due to COVID. If you email us before the end of the event on Sunday, we will switch your booking to complimentary. The entire cost of your ticket will be fully refunded to your account, but you will still qualify as having attended, so you will still be eligible to submit a downtime and receive XP benefits as if you had attended the event normally.
## Travel and Camping
* Try to share transport and camping logistics with members of your household group where practical
* Make sure that everyone you are sharing transport to the event with has an appropriate COVID test result before embarking
* If you are getting dropped off at the event, your lift will need to comply with our entry requirements
We recommend that where possible you travel and camp in household groups. When this is not possible, you should consider what you will do if one of you develops COVID symptoms or tests positive for COVID during the event, and plan accordingly. Our player support team will do everything possible to help, but we cannot provide transport home. We will have a small number of spare tents available for people who are isolating, but these are intended as an emergency backup for people who have no other option.
If you getting a lift to the event, then your driver will need a negative LFT test if they have any newly developed symptoms that could indicate a COVID infection.
