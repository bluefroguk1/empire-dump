## Definition
A [[Herb garden]] represents an area of land where herbs grow. A Herb garden can be of almost any size - it could be a tiny personal garden in an [[Urizen]] [[Spire]], meticulously tended and cared for, or it could be a vast Forest in [[Wintermark]] or [[Varushka]] that a character scours in search of wild herbs.
## Production
A Herb garden produces 6 doses of true vervain, 2 doses of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], 2 doses of [[Bladeroot]], 2 doses of [[Imperial Roseweald]], and 2 doses of [[Marrowort]].
## Downtime Options
It is possible to obtain a higher yield from a herb garden. You may spend 6 crowns to have the Herb garden produce an additional 3 true vervain, 1 cerulean mazzarine, 1 Imperial roseweald, 1 bladeroot and 1 marrowort in that season.
## Upgrades
A herb garden can be upgraded using [[Weirwood]] obtained from the Bourse. Each time a Herb garden is upgraded, the owner chooses a single herb from the list. The herb garden produces 2 additional doses of that herb from then on.
To upgrade a Herb garden requires Imperial wains of weirwood equal to the level the Herb garden is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 Herb garden Costs 2 Imperial wains of weirwood, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.

The table below shows a list of the rituals in [[Imperial lore]] which can affect the production of a herb garden.
