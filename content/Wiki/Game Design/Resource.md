## Personal [[Resource]]
* Every PC chooses one personal resource at character creation
* Your resource determines where your character nominally lives
* You can never have more than one personal resource
Every character chooses one type of personal resource and what [[Territory]] it is located in when their character is created. The territory becomes the character's home territory. Most personal resources automatically produce money or items for the characterâ€™s use every event that they attend.
Personal resources have broad generic names that imply a whole category of possible options. Like income, it is up to the player to interpret the precise nature of their personal resource in a way that is appropriate to [[The setting|the setting]] and their character.
* [[Business]] - produces 9 crowns.
* [[Congregation]] - produces five doses of [[Liao]] and provides 10 votes in the [[Imperial Synod]].
* [[Farm]] - produces 9 crowns.
* [[Fleet]] - can trade with foreigners to produce items or money, take part in adventures with specific rewards, or engage in privateering to produce random resources.
* [[Forest]] - produces twelve measures of one rare material that are used by an artisan to make [[Magic Items|magic items]].
* [[Herb garden]] - produces fourteen [[Herbs|herbs]] for use by a [[Physick|physick]] or [[Apothecary|apothecary]].
* [[Mana site]] - produces seven crystalized mana for use in [[Spellcasting]] and [[Rituals]].
* [[Military unit]] - can be used to enhance an [[Imperial army]], take part in adventures with specific rewards, or engage in paid work to produce random resources.
* [[Mine]] - produces twelve ingots of one rare metal that are used by an artisan to make [[Magic|magic]] items.
All personal resources can be upgraded to make them more productive or effective. Upgrading a personal resource requires building [[Materials|materials]] which are held in Imperial warehouses and can be acquired at [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. A personal resource may only receive one upgrade per [[Downtime|downtime]]. Though there are occasionally effects that reduce the [[Cost|cost]] of the upgrading a resource it always requires a minimum of one wain.
You can never operate more than one personal resource at once. Although a group might hold more than one personal resource, each character can only own and use one personal resource. This represents the time and effort required to manage the resource.
Although Orcs cannot purchase [[Religious skills|religious skills]], they can purchase a [[Congregation|congregation]]. They receive [[Liao|liao]] and votes in [[The Synod|the Synod]] accordingly.
Personal resources can be improved to make them more effective, those resources that produce money or items [[Will|will]] produce more when improved. 
## Campaign Resource
*Any character may be allocated control of a campaign resource
*You may control more than one campaign resource
*You may legally only hold one [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] or position
Campaign resources are similar to personal resources, but each one is unique and they can only be acquired in play. [[Characters]] do not own campaign resources, they are assigned them as a result of the actions of [[Characters|characters]] at the event. Some Imperial titles, such as [[General]] have a campaign resource associated with them. Although you may control any number of campaign resources at once, the [[Imperial Constitution|Imperial constitution]] forbids an individual from holding more than one [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] at once.
''E.g. The Imperial title of [[General]] of the 1st Marcher Army. The character with the position has control of the accompanying army and can determine its actions between [[Events|events]]. The [[Imperial Constitution|Imperial constitution]] forbids any Imperial citizen from holding two offices simultaneously, so a Marcher [[Senator|senator]] would have to resign their position to assume this position.''
''E.g. The Lord of the Four Winds, an [[Eternal]] from the [[Realm|realm]] of [[Autumn]] can choose to give control of the North Wind to a character. This campaign resource is not an Imperial title or position, so it does not affect your ability to control any other campaign resource.
Campaign resources are unique, they may produce money or items or they may present other options for your character between [[Events|events]].''
Examples of campaign resources include the [[Limitu Principality House of the Way]] and the [[Gloaming Road]]
## Changing Resources
*It costs 2 crowns for a character to exchange their resource for a new one
If your existing character wishes to change their resource for a new one, either a different resource or the same resource in a different territory, then you can do so [mailto:admin@profounddecisions.co.uk by email] between events. Your character [[Will|will]] be charged 2 crowns to represent the charges they incur in changing their resource. You can only request a new resource in one of the territories that forms part of your nation. If you wish to exchange or sell your resource to another character, this also costs a total of 2 crowns.
If you are playing a [[Brand|brand]] new character and realize you have made a genuine mistake, then we will not charge your character to change their resource. If you do not have the money in your character inventory, it is possible to change the resource by creating a debt for your character which will be automatically deducted from your character's income at following events.
If a character in your group or territory dies leaving an upgraded resource and you wish to take it over in place of your own, this can be requested in the same way with the additional information of the deceased character's CID. You cannot, however, take on the resource of your own deceased character. Disputes arising during time in from such transfers will be handled IC as a civil claim (See also Will).
## Changing Territories
* [[The Empire]] identifies where your character lives based on the location of their resource
*To change territory, you must obtain a new resource in a new territory
Imperial citizens (especially the [[Navarr]]) may move freely around [[The Empire|the Empire]] as they choose, however a resource ''cannot'' move. Because of this, [[The game|the game]] is not concerned where your character is at any given moment, instead, the location of your personal resource determines your "territory". Your territory can be important for [[Rituals]] and is critical for voting in senatorial elections in some nations. This means if you want to change the territory where your character lives then you ''must'' obtain a new resource in the new territory. This follows the standard rules for changing resources above.
The [[Cost|cost]] to change resource still applies if you own a [[Military unit]] or a [[Fleet]] and wish to change territory. Both these resources include the active service and involvement of a large number of Imperial citizens. These citizens have homes, families and roots in the territory they are based in - and they do not wish to change territory even though you do.
## Conquered Territories
For the sake of simplicity, we assume the most advantageous situation reasonable applies to a resource that is in a territory being fought over. So a resource is unaffected if the territory it is based in is partially controlled by [[Barbarians|barbarians]] - even if the barbarians control the majority of the regions in that territory such that it is not eligible to return a [[Senator|senator]] to the [[Imperial Senate]]. However, if a territory is completely conquered by barbarians with every region controlled by them, then all resources in that territory suffer a 50% production penalty.
For example, the majority of [[Holberg]] is controlled by the [[Druj]], but there is no effect on resources here, while the Empire controls one of the regions in the territory - in this case the portion of the fortified city of [[Holberg]] that remains under their control. We assume that player resources in Holberg are in the Imperial held region - or at least close enough to enjoy the benefits thereof. 
If the last region in Holberg falls to the barbarians then every resource in the territory would suffer a 50% production penalty, we assume that inventive players who are determined to hang on find some way to operate their resources and collect some portion of the wealth. How this is achieved is left to the player to decide for themselves as part of their personal story.
Resources are used by the [[Imperial Civil Service|Imperial civil service]] to calculate a citizen's votes in a number of cases, most notably in the [[Bourse]] and the [[Synod]]. In these cases, the number of votes received is similarly affected.
## Resources in other Nations
If a character finds themselves owning a personal resource in another nation than their own, that resource suffers a 33% production penalty while it is under their control. This penalty reflects the natural predisposition of inhabitants of [[The Nations|the nations]] of the Empire to favour trade and interaction with citizens of their nation. It affects all types of resource, including military units and fleets.
