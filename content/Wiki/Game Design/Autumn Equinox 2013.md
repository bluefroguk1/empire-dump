## Overview
This page currently lists all the details that are specific for our fourth Empire event - the [[Autumn Equinox 2013]]. There is an additional page with [[Event Information]] which lists arrival and departure times and similar details that are common for all Empire [[Events]].
## Battles
At the Autumn Equinox we will be running two large battles, one 11:00 Saturday morning and one 11:00 Sunday morning, along with a large number of smaller encounters. The large battles will follow the normal rules for Battles; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one.
### Volunteering
Players are welcome to volunteer to help PD crew the smaller encounters, but are not obliged to do so - anyone who volunteers to help by monstering an encounter will receive a token that enables you to collect a free drink from the bar as thanks.
## Site Map
The map shows the layout of the OOC camping fields and the IC area. The grey lines in the in-character field are roads that go through the camps. These roads will be laid out with fencing pins and nylon rope until the start of the event. You must not pitch your tent in the road, the red hats are under instructions to move any tents pitched in the IC roads.
No cars are allowed in the IC camping area at this event - they may only use the road indicated by the grey line that circles around the field. The road will be wide enough for you to pUll up and park so that you can unload your vehicle next to your camp. Please unload your camping equipment and then move your vehicle to the car park before putting up your tent to allow other players to unload.
If you have a trailer or a large vehicle such as a minibus then you may drive that on to the field to unload. To do that you must wait at the IC entrance to the field. A member of the PD security team will then escort you vehicle to your camp where you can unload your vehicle. Once you are ready to move your vehicle to the car park you must request a member of the PD team escort your vehicle off the field.
## OOC Camping
The OOC camping area will be laid out in lines with fencing pins and nylon rope. The system is designed to separate the tents from the cars so the rope has signs hanging from it which indicates that you should park you car adjacent to the rope and then pitch your tent ''[[On the other side]] of the rope''.
Do not pitch your tents in the wide lane between the guide ropes, this lane must be kept free for access.
