http://creative-commons.deviantart.com/ looks like a great place to start - it also gives you a workaround of how to search the whole of deviantart for CC works.
If you go to google images and to the Search Tools button there is a dropdown for usage rights. Click "Labeled for reuse" and it searches across a bunch of these sites we've mentioned and also some others e.g. public-domain-image.com, pixabay.com and geograph.org.uk
