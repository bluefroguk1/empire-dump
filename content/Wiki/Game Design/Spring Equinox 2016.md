## [[Battles]]
At the event we [[Will|will]] be running two large [[Battles|battles]], one Saturday morning and one Sunday morning. The large battles [[Will|will]] follow the normal rules for Battles; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one. The sides for the battles [[Will|will]] be chosen by the generals in the [[Muster]] of the [[Imperial Military Council]] on Friday [[Night|night]]. 
The fighting begins at 11:00 am - but if you are playing the battle then you [[Will|will]] need to [[Muster|muster]] up before this time and if you are [[Monstering|monstering]] then you need to make your way to the monster area for 10:00 am to give us time to get you into [[Costume|costume]], made-up and briefed.
## Quests
At our previous event we asked for player volunteers to give us a few hours to monster some of our larger quests. This let us run much more plot at the event so we're asking for more help again this time. 
To help us organize folk, we've set aside a slot for each nation to volunteer to monster, which are listed below.

17:00-18:30Wintermark17:00-18:30Urizen, [[League]] & [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]]
[[Monstering]] during this slot is purely voluntary - but it [[Will|will]] help us put on a much better event for everyone. We are tracking the numbers of players who volunteer from each nation on an ongoing basis and using that to create equivalent sized quest [[Opportunities|opportunities]] for those nations at the next event. In effect, we'll try and deliver more fights to [[The Nations|the nations]] that volunteer the most - on the assumption that those nations contain the players who want those opportunities the most.
## Site Map
The site map is opposite; the camp coordinators for each camp will have their own layout for their camp, showing where all the tents they know about are to be pitched. If you do not know where you are supposed to be camping, then please speak to them on arrival at your nation's camp.
## Mobility Camp
The area marked with a wheelchair on the out-of-character camp is intended for participants with mobility needs. If you have genuine mobility needs then you can park your car here in the out-of-character camp - but still come and go throughout the event provided you have parked the car near the road. Please discuss with the crew if you have a disability that means you will need to camp here.
There are two disabled toilets at the event, one is part of the showers next to the disabled camp - the other is in the in-character field near [[Varushka]] and the [[Imperial Orcs]]. In addition there are two more disabled toilets in the shower units 750m away in the quiet camping field, if you are choosing to camp there.
