## Description
These items often take the form of a simple weltsilver chain with an amulet in the shape of a key. The key itself is usually of delicately fine craftsmanship with an intriguing lustre - blackened but glistening in a captivating manner that draws the eye deeper.

Equipped with such a talisman, a warrior or trader may open the portal to and enter the Hall of Worlds (or indeed any portal), alongside their magician comrades even while encased in plate armour. The magic is only good for one trip per day, however, as its power is required for both the outward and return journey... provided there is a return journey. A famous example of this item is the ''key'' designed for [[Emperor Frederick]] - an [[Ilium#Creating_Artefacts|artefact]] constructed by the renowned artisan Catherine de Sarvos, which allowed the mundane Emperor to enter the Hall of Worlds and attend [[Conclave session|sessions]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]]. Some scholars suggest the artefact was usable more often than the common example, but the key itself was stolen shortly after Frederick's death and its current whereabouts unknown so this cannot be verified.

## Rules

* Effect: Twice each day with thirty seconds of appropriate roleplaying you may open a portal as if you had cast the [[operate portal]] spell. You may use this power if you are wearing armour.
* Materials: Crafting a Pauper's Key requires six ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]]; seven measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]]; and nine measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]; It takes 1 month to make one of these items.

"Ere, I can even opens that portal over there." the guttersnipe pointed towards the Sentinel Gate.

"Sir, you are a fool. I cannot fathom the trick you are trying to pull here, but there is not a chance that you are a mage." The militiamen was clearly becoming impatient.

"I'll show ya then" quipped the beragged one, and proceeded to march across the square towards the Gate.

"Not so fast, I haven't finished with you - I'm not about to let you escape through there!" he quickly stepped after the wastrel managing to grab a hold of him before he could step through, the neck of his tunic gaped and revealed a strangely glinting key-shaped amulet. Behind the location where he had been standing, a dark figure slinked away.

"I don't care if you are a magician, I still don't believe that you unbound that blade before selling it! Who is your accomplice!"
