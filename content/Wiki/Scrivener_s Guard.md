## Description
This leather cuirass is favoured by [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]] and [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] senators, diplomats, negotiators and merchants who go to dangerous places in the pursuit of their duties. It is also popular with [[Wintermark military concerns#Banner-bearers|banner-bearers]] and [[Wintermark culture and customs#Scop|scops]]. In these professions, many lack the boisterous spirit found among those who thrive on the battlefield, so they often seek out inspiring weapons to accompany the armour such as a [[Triumphant Blade]].

In [[Urizen]] each piece of leather has a strand of [[weltsilver]] thread running through in an attempt to achieve the greatest possible shine when exposed [[Urizen_hearth_magic#Light|light]], while an [[Imperial Orcs|Orcish]] smith might gather portions of leather from her hardiest comrades before combining them to produce a patchwork armour of great [[Worth]] drawing on the resilience of all the past owners. In [[Wintermark]] and most other lands, tiny runes are engraved into the leather, usually [[Evrom]], the rune of beginnings, to give the wearer a fresh start or occasionally [[Naeve]], the rune of hunger, to drive the wearer through hardship and on to greater things. 

The Freeborn Emperor Ahraz is known to have worn a set of Scrivener's Guard during most of his career, including his negotiations with the rebellious orc slaves. When queried about why he did not don a more powerful suit of armour he is said to have replied:
 "I am a diplomat, not a warrior. My armour is more to stop me being a burden on my bodyguards than to aid me in battle. If a fight breaks out, I will do my best but I am no soldier and no amount of armour will make me one. Better I save my money and spend it somewhere it will do good -  on weapons and armour for those to whom I entrust my life."
