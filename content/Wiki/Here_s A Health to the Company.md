Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine
Come lift up your voices, all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again

Chorus:
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again

Here's a health to the dear lass that I love so well
For her style and for her beauty, there's none can excel
There's a smile upon her countenance as she sits on my knee
There is none in this wide world as happy as me

Chorus

Our ship lies at anchor, she's ready to dock
I wish her safe landing without any shock
If ever I should meet you by land or by sea
I will always remember your kindness to me

Chorus x 2
