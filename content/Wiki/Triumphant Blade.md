## Description
A Triumphant Blade is a popular enchanted weapon, used throughout the Empire in various forms. A heroic individual may enhance their reservoir of inner strength directly, but with a little effort anyone can benefit from the fire the weapon kindles in their soul. In addition to allowing even the meekest senator to stand firm in the face of malign spiritual presences, it is sometimes coupled with other enchanted items such as [[Scrivener's Guard]] to serve as a mystical 'power source' for the second item.

A [[Dawn|Dawnish]] Triumphant Blade often bears the rune [[Tykonus]], while a [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]]-forged axe or sword is just as likely to bear [[Gralm]] or [[Ull]], the runes associated with fate and chance. In [[Varushka]], a ''Schlacta's Axe'' is a popular weapon bought by rich boyars for their favoured captains, while the [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] and officers of the [[Free Companies]] of the [[The League|League]] alike are known to favour beautifully crafted and decorated Triumphant Blades as marks of office.

## Rules
