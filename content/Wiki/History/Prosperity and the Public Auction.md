## Overview
For a long time it was traditional for private citizens who had supplies of [[Mithril]], [[White granite]], [[Weirwood]] and [[Ilium]] to send them to [[Anvil]] to be auctioned to the highest bidder by the civil service. In [[Summer]] 382YE, a Highborn protest against the open market approach to selling [[White granite|white granite]] led to conflict within [[The Empire|the Empire]], leading to [[The Synod|the Synod]] urging mass boycotts of the [[Public auction|public auction]].
## The Cinderpath Exchange
The incident began when an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] was identified for [[Highguard]] to create the Cinderpath Exchange. Frustration arising from the repeated failure of Highborn projects to get approval from the [[Imperial Senate]], led to [[Benefactors|benefactors]] arguing that Highborn citizens should look to create their own market for surplus [[White granite|white granite]]. Their plan was for local merchants to get a good price for their goods, while allowing the Highborn [[Assembly]] to appoint someone to purchase the [[White granite|white granite]] to put it to a virtuous use.
To rally support for the initiative and make it more effective, the [[Synod]] had the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to endorse mandates in support of the proposal. The major drawback with the scheme, apart from the costs of establishing the exchange, were that it would result in less [[White granite|white granite]] being available for auction in the [[Public auction|public auction]] at [[Anvil]].
## Opposition in [[The Senate|the Senate]]
The Exchange almost immediately ran into problems. A motion to [[Commission|commission]] the exchange was voted down by the [[Imperial Senate]], but the outcome was judged to have been materially affected by incorrect information provided by Magistrate Abraham on the floor of the [[Senate]]. Somewhat red-faced the civil service agreed to bring the motion back to the Senate as an [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]] - whereupon it was summarily defeated again.
At the same time the civil service were challenged over the constitutional advice offered initially that suggested that the title could be appointed by [[Judgement|judgement]] of the Highborn [[Assembly]]. After due consideration the civil service issued an amendment explaining that that the constitutional path for [[Appointment|appointment]] would be by [[Tally of the Votes]] - which in [[Highguard]] would mean a vote by owners of congregations. While the net outcome is relatively similar, this has very different legal and constitutional implications.
In response to popular support from [[General|general]] populace, the Highborn Senators tried again in 383YE [[Spring]], but the Senate still refused to pass the motion. Instead, it was announced by the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]], circumventing the need for Senate approval.
## Support in the Synod
Although the Senate initially declined to authorize the [[Commission|commission]] of the Cinderpath Exchange, Bartimaeus led the Highborn [[Assembly]] to endorse a [[Mandate|mandate]] urging citizens to support the exchange. With no exchange to support, that might have been the end of the matter, but in [[Autumn]] 382YE, at the subsequent summit, Edna of the Chantry led the [[Prosperity]] [[Assembly]] to pass a [[Statement of Principle]] supporting the construction of the Cinderpath Exchange which passed with a [[Greater majority|greater majority]].
This statement was communicated across [[The Empire|the Empire]] and led to widespread interest in the fate of the Cinderpath Exchange and the role of the [[Public auction|public auction]] and created [[Opportunities|opportunities]] for the Synod to become involved in the debate. There were a number of mandates the Synod could have passed, but in the end they chose three.
The Highborn [[Assembly]] endorsed a [[Mandate|mandate]] by Raziel of the Shattered Tower calling for Highborn citizens to boycott the [[Public auction|public auction]]. At the same time, the [[Prosperity]] Assembly endorsed a similar [[Mandate|mandate]] from Edna of the Chantry calling for all citizens to refuse to send their white granite to [[Anvil]] for sale at the [[Public auction|public auction]]. Meanwhile the [[General Assembly]] endorsed a [[Mandate|mandate]] by Bartimaeus urging the citizens of every land to look for ways that [[The Bourse|the bourse]] resources currently being sent to the Public Auction might be harnessed by their own people.
## Opportunities Elsewhere
By Spring 383YE, the supply of [[Bourse|bourse]] resources coming to [[Anvil]] for sale in the public auction had halved as a result of the Edna's [[Mandate|mandate]] in the [[Prosperity]] Assembly. With resources being stockpiled rather than sold, three nations put forward plans of their own, styled on the Cinderpath Exchange, to develop their own alternatives to the public auction in response to Bartimaeus mandate in the [[General]] Assembly urging them to do exactly that.
There were three proposals in all. The first was for the Invisible Cord Brokerage, a [[Ministry|ministry]] supporting the sale of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] in Seren. The second was the The Clever Magpie, which facilitate the sale of [[Ilium|ilium]] in Kalpaheim. The final proposal was to restore the Iron Roundtower to allow Varushkan merchants to support the sale of [[Mithril|mithril]] in [[Karov]]. All three of these proposals would allow the appointed title holder to purchase the relevant bourse [[Materials|materials]] - but would mean a direct reduction in such [[Materials|materials]] coming up for sale at the public auction in [[Anvil]].
Perhaps unsurprisingly these three proposals faced challenges in the [[Imperial Senate]]. Wintermarkers made no attempt to [[Commission|commission]] the Clever Magpie, and the [[Senate motion|Senate Motion]] by [[Miaren]] to [[Commission|commission]] the Invisible Cord failed to get a majority. It had to be resubmitted by [[Miaren]] in Summer 383YE before the Senate gave approval. The Varushkans opted not to raise a motion in the Senate at all and instead announced the construction of the Iron Roundtower using an Imperial Wayleave.
In Summer 383YE, the [[Freeborn]] had the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to refurbish the Dust Parador, creating their own equivalent of the Cinderpath Exchange in [[Kahraman]]. In Autumn 383YE, it was the turn of the Marchers, with a chance to construct the Blackfield Market, but again the proposal foundered in the [[Imperial Senate]].
Interest in strengthening the nation, and putting virtue ahead of money, was still high in Autumn 383YE but the civil service calculated that interest would likely fade by the start of the [[Winter]] Solstice. Thus there was a final [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for the national assemblies of [[Dawn]], the [[Imperial Orcs]], [[The League|the League]], [[Wintermark]] and [[Urizen]] to encourage their citizens to push for their own version of the Cinderpath Exchange by passing suitable an appropriate [[Statement of Principle|statement of principle]] with a greater majority. Only two nations submitted such a [[Judgement|judgement]], [[Dawn]] and [[Wintermark]], and only [[Wintermark]] managed to achieve the greater majority needed. The Dawnish [[Judgement|judgement]] passed, but with insufficient votes to convince citizens it was [[Worth|worth]] pursuing.
