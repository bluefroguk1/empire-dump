## Prelude to Invasion
The [[Summer Storm]], the [[Bloodcloaks]], and the [[Green Shield]] withdraw from [[Skallahn]], out of Iron Stand into [[Sermersuaq]]. Back in [[Wintermark]], they join up with four other [[Imperial armies]]... and barely missing a beat launch an overwhelming invasion of [[Tromsa]], believed to be the northernmost of the [[Jotun]] territories.
They're joined by the [[Strong Reeds]], the [[Tusks]], and the [[Bounders]], three armies of Marchers hunting the fugitive Mathilda Fisher, believed to have taken refuge with the Jarl of [[Tromsa]] after her comprehensive defeat in [[Bregasland]]. They're also joined by the [[Fire of the South]], the [[Freeborn]] army making a forced march across the length of [[The Empire|the Empire]] from [[Kahraman]].
Seven Imperial armies. Some thirty-five thousand soldiers from four nations, supported by more than twenty-five thousand warriors fighting as part of elite warbands, led by Imperial captains. They're ''also'' supported by ten thousand fey knights from [[The Fields of Glory|the Fields of Glory]], a splendid rainbow of armoured warriors that glow with inner light, called forth by Imperial magicians. 
[[Bloodcloaks]], my [[Rhyv]] rimmed [[Grimnir|grimnir]], my dauntless warlike champions, the [[Jotun]] look to us in [[Skallahn]] but we have greater work in the north. We [[Will|will]] be the mighty host to the Mark. The unyielding storm. Fear no engagement. Dare every [[Heroism|heroism]]. The greenshield out tireless triumphannt vanguard. We take Tromsa here. Now. Conversion requires common ground. Let's take some.
[[Heroes]] of the Greenshield, hail to thee! Captains go to the [[Bloodcloak]], her [[War|war]] host [[Will|will]] walk us to triumph. We go to the vanguard, blood-glistening spears to cut them a way. Triumphant charge across the border, be first amongst the foe. All of the West comes with you, join us and see, heralds of [[Janon]]. Arm in arm to hard won [[War|war]]-play come [[Summer|summer]] swords and elfin-shot. To Jarl Olgaf we taken this war time, shields will be sundered! That war [[Day|day]], that red day, now comes early to Tromsa.
Every army save the [[Fire of the South]] and the [[Strong Reeds]] [[Marches|marches]] with a contingent of the Summer heralds – and the Fire of the South have their own allies. Snow-white warriors in coal-black around, lips and eyes red as blood, armed with viciously hooked and serrated blades. Clanking and whispering with the chains that adorn or bind them, have been sent by the Bound King to aid the bold Freeborn. Apparently the Thrice-cursed King appreciated the [[Winter magic]] the army used in [[Kahraman]], and in return for allowing him to slake his hunger in [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]], he has sent his court to support the Freeborn just as he has the Dawnish and the [[Navarr]] in the past.
The [[Green Shield]] and [[Summer Storm]] have additional allies. One dark [[Night|night]] shortly before entering Tromsa, a double handful of lithe, crimson dancers emerge from the shadows to march alongside the Winterfolk, and another score or so with the [[Imperial Orcs]]. Barely armoured, scarlet skin covered with intricate golden tattoos, they are full of passionate intensity, inspiring their fellow warriors and urging them to embrace the things that rule their hearts. In battle they are relentless, full of unquenchable energy, leaping and spinning through the fray with their short spears. Emissaries of the Shadowed Fire, there at the behest of the generals. Their presence is not welcomed by the Summer Knights fighting with those armies, but for the most part they do their best to ignore [[Janon]]'s chosen. Unfortunately the unpredictable heralds of the ''Shadowed Flame'' seem to take that as a personal [[Challenge|challenge]], seeking [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to show elfin warriors up on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], or infuriate them when the fighting is over.
Shortly before the armies leave [[Sermersuaq]], one final group of peculiar creatures turn up to join them. A contingent of short metallic creatures that seem to be made of silvery-white metal. They present themselves to the commanders of the Imperial forces, and say that they have been paid by [[The Academy|the Academy]] of [[Heroes]] to “''[[Fight|fight]] the Jotun somewhere''.” They are beings of the [[Autumn]] [[Realm|realm]], three odd little mercenary companies named the ''Plate Metal Reeves''; the ''Tin Helms''; and the ''Mercury Blades''. The commanders are not entirely sure what to make of them but their intent seems sincere. They are not very strong – certainly not a match for any Imperial soldier - but they work very well together, perfectly drilled to [[Fight|fight]] alongside others and follow orders. They are also, patently, made of tin, which makes them very fragile. They are given roles as runners, although they insist on trying to fight alongside the much larger human and orc soldiers at every turn, in accordance with their contracts.
The armies gather in Stark, at the Fortress of Kalant. The presence of so many creatures of the [[Realms|realms]] alongside the Imperial forces conjures a peculiar atmosphere; there is something almost unreal at times about this campaign under the aching skies at the top of the world. Putting such feelings aside as best they can, once the gathering of forces is complete, Imperial troops cross the southern arm of the Lansipari, and drive west into Tromsa. The Green Shield lead [[The Way|the way]], charging heroically into the unknown, but each of the other armies strives to match them - only the Fire of the South lag behind a little, tired from their long march north.
Freeborn, we take our fire north, let our passion be at the fore front. Let our flame burn bright. One more season of fighting the Jotun. We will fight cleanly as freeborn should. Joined by the bound kings knights. We will not execute, we will not attack those retreating. We will not attack the healers. Follow our flame!
Warriors of the Summer Storm! We have [[Gone|gone]] into Skallahn and heard Sjofn Bittenblade, now lets go into Tromsa! Let me formally invite the heralds of Janon on our Overwhelming Assault on Tromsa. Together we shall free the thralls and take back their land! We are going into battle with our ancestors and we shall see what Sjofn has to say as we take all we can!
## Into Icewood
Tromsa is ruled over by Jarl Olgaf Anagarsson, an experienced warrior known for his wildness, who heeds only the words of Yrsa Jansdóttir, Queen of Kalsea, and the counsel of his respected rival Ustigar, the aging Jarl of Kierheim. Much like Skallahn, he leads six lesser Jarls, each of whom presides over a single region, representing one of the great extended clans of the western orcs. It seems they are not expecting seventy thousand Imperial soldiers. They have been caught flat-footed by the strategy of the [[Military Council]], focusing their attention to the south, in Skallahn. That is not to say that the [[Territory|territory]] is defenceless – the Jotun are well known for building forts and castles wherever they go. Yet no castle, not even the Castle of Thorns, not even the unscalable walls of [[Holberg]], can hold off seventy-thousand troops for long.
Not much is known about this cold northern territory; only what little was gleaned during the recent expedition to map the [[Sea of Snow]], and stories of old campaigns against the Jotun have surprisingly little to say about it. There is snow here, even in the height of Summer. The land is rugged and wild, broken by hills that rise to mountainous heights in places. There is a particularly impressive peak at the heart of Tromsa, which the thralls say is called Mount Majastind and claim is [[The Throne|the throne]] of the gods. The rest of the territory is peppered with unwelcoming forests, especially along the eastern borders. 
One such [[Forest|forest]] is ''Icewood'', the first region of Tromsa encountered by Imperials, a vast wild land that apparently runs the entire length of the eastern border. Its hills are covered in a cloak of ancient, black-barked trees – pine, fire, beggarwood, and spruce – and have few roads. This poses a [[Challenge|challenge]] in itself, as do the predatory dire beasts that lurk in the depths of the [[Forest|forest]]. They mostly flee before large [[Groups|groups]] of soldiers, but smaller parties of scouts sometimes find themselves in dreadful life-or-death struggles with dire wolves, a behemoth ice bear, or even stranger creatures. There's also the problem of the cold. Even though the Summer Solstice is barely past, the weather is bitter. The Fire of the South in particular, feel the bite of the chill winds blowing down out of Sydanjaa, but even the Winterfolk are a little unprepared for just how sharp the fangs of these lazy winds prove to be.
There are Jotun here, mostly thralls in scattered villages who hunt the beasts of the forest – including the immense darkhide dire elk - or gather [[Ambergelt]] and [[Dragonbone]] from among the trees. As with Skallahn, they mostly flee when they encounter Imperial soldiers. The overwhelming majority are orcs - there appear to be very few human thralls in the Icewood. They are subjects of Jarl Bjørnda Bearcrusher, a doughty Jotun who it is said once crushed an ice-bear's head with her bare hands, and her warriors are quick to respond to the Imperial invasion. [[Bands]] of Ulfur begin to probe [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s forces, avoiding direct conflict, reporting back to their mistress, and marking the progress of the Imperial forces. Cunning Bearcrusher abandons her hall, rallying her warriors and as many of her thralls as she can, and retreating westward, once the sheer size of the Imperial forces massed against them is clear.
Icewood is claimed by the Empire within a handful of weeks, although the depths of the forest remain just as unknown as they were before. There is one particularly notable encounter in the north. A band of bloodcloaks following a trail seemingly left by thralls fleeing a nearby settlement enter an area of the forest where the firs and pines are all marked with unfamiliar glyphs. These angular sigils are cut deep into the bark, and the trees are adorned with wood and bone tokens carved with the [[Runes|runes]] [[Hirmok]], [[Irremais]], and [[Wyr]]. 
They have not progressed far, when a quartet of massive humanoid beings seemingly built of animal bones bound together with leather thongs and surmounted with the horned skulls or immense aurochs, elk, and moose emerge suddenly from the shadows. Their eyes burn with a dull blue fire, and between them walks an orc woman wearing an eyeless bird-mask and a feathered mantle. She warns the Winterfolk that they are trespassing – not on the lands of the Jarl Bjørnda but into the demesne of ''Fiksuvaris, Raðljóst's [[Guide]]''. A domain where they are not welcome. An [[Icewalker]] with the scouts is able to determine that this area of forest belongs to, or has been claimed by, [[Wise Rangara]] – and that if the armies want to claim it they will need to fight the [[Eternal]] to do so. The scouts wisely withdraw, leaving the decision of what to do about this place to someone else.
The place appears to be one of those peculiar embassies the Jotun maintain to the magical realms – places Imperial spies have seen in [[Hordalant]], and whose existence inspired the creation of fanes in the Empire. At this time [[Wise Rangara]] seems disinclined to interfere in the conquest of the Icewood, so the decision is made to leave a small force of a hundred soldiers behind to keep an eye on the [[Rune|rune]]-marked woods, and to continue the invasion of Tromsa. It is a difficult decision though, especially given the dangers posted by [[Estavus]]' [[Fane|fane]] provided for Imperial forces in the recent campaign in Skallahn.
## Skyfall
From the Icewood, the Imperial forces divide, pressing westward. The Marcher armies and the Fire of the South emerge from the forest in the south, while the [[Imperial Orcs]] and the Winterfolk leave the woods to the north-west, emerging onto a storm-swept tundra. These are the ''Skyfall Wastes'', according to the thralls. No trees grow here, and if anything they are even more sparsely settled than the Icewood. 
At night the northern lights are clearly visible in the clear skies, and barely a month after the height of Summer it is normal to awaken to frost on the ground and flurries of snow. All the orcs encountered wear sigils, marked with the rune [[Diras]] which they grudgingly explain hide them from the attention of the twisting ribbons of ice, and from the wicked spirits that sometimes come down from the north with the howling winds. Travel far enough north across the Skyfall Wastes and one finds Tsirku, and the endless storm of Sydanjaa.
Jarl Hodne Hodnesson has a lightly fortified hall, built atop an artificial mound, in the southern part of the region. Considered something of a [[Mystic|mystic]] in Jotun terms, Bjarnesson's warriors are no match for the Empire, but fight desperately to try and stem the Imperial advance. They know the tundra well, and use that to their advantage, but they are massively overmatched, and Hodnesshal swiftly falls. Hodne echoes Jarl Bjørnda; he and his champions retreat west. Skyfall is conquered.
This area includes Lake Karnakadatha, a massive body of water similar to those found in Sermersuaq that lies on the border between the Skyfall Wastes and Tsirku. The waters here are significantly warmer than those in the rest of the region, and numerous small settlements dot its shores. The main industry here is fishing, but that is not the reason that Jarl Hodnesson maintains several watchtowers and a force of warriors here. The lake was apparently formed long ages past when the Northern Lights apparently caused a fragment of star to fall and destroy the castle of a prideful Jarl. Star metal is commonly pulled from the depths of the lake, or found in the bellies of fish. Some of those fish are apparently very odd indeed. Both strange fish and star metal are sent south, to be used by the Jotun smiths, and are apparently the main reason Skyfall is settled at all.
Reeds! Folk heroes of [[Bregasland]], we have shown the fire that burns in our hearts and run the Jotun and Fisher out of Bregasland. But do we stop there? Do we rest on our laurels? Of course not. We will take up the chase and march into their land, see how they fucking like it. March with me friends! [[Loyalty]] [[Calls|calls]] us to drag matilda fisher from her hole.
Jacks of the [[Tusks]]! We [[March On|march on]] Tromsa to take the war to Jotun homelands. Bring all your virtue to bear as we take away their means to wage war. They say fisher is hiding here, Leave no ground to go to.
Marchers, I march as your [[General|general]] one last time. Infused with the power of summer we take the war to the Jotun and hated Mathilda Fisher should she be found. Tonight we strike, [[There is thunder|there is thunder]] in the sky, together we fight; some of us will die, they'll always remember how we made a stand, and many will die by our hand!
## Rikskog and the Battle of Viheltavathorn
West of Icewood, south of Skyfall, lie the lands of Jarl Klarra Sembansscion. Heavily forested in the east, the region becomes flatter and more open as one travels westward. The first actual farms are encountered – if you can call them as such. The Marchers scoff at the hardscrabble life that amounts to agriculture here. The soil is hard and cold, and most of the thralls focus on raising herd animals rather than trying to grow crops.
There are also a large number of burial mounds here – noticeably more than the Imperial armies have encountered elsewhere in Skallahn or Tromsa. The thralls barely cooperate with the Imperial soldiers, but share a few stories of the long-ago [[Battles|battles]] between the Jarls of Skallahn and Tromsa. It seems these two territories have not always been so closely allied, although the stories strongly imply that these conflicts ended before the fall of Terunael.
These ancient [[Battles|battles]] may explain the presence of Viheltavathorn; the hall of the Jarl of Rikskog is a heavily fortified tower surrounded by a small town. The largest settlement the invaders have encountered so far, it is also the site of the first organised resistance against the Imperial armies.
Jarl Klarra Sembansscion leads the defence of Rikskog themselves. Warned by Jarl Bjørnda's Ulfur, they also have an unexpected ally. More than a thousand Yegarra, many with pike and pole-arm, are camped around Viheltavathorn. There had been stories that when they were driven out of Bregasland, the Fishers of Fisher's Rock did not return to their lands in [[Hordalant]], but fled north. Rumour suggests that the Jarl of Tromsa owed his life to Mathilda Fisher, and that the would-be [[Steward]] of the Bregas has fled back to his lands. The fact that Mathilda's presence has brought the angry Marcher armies down on Tromsa is not likely to be overlooked.
The first actual battle takes place on the plains before the town, Jotun and Yegarra clashing with Marcher and Freeborn. Additional reinforcements begin to arrive from further west, led by Jarl Olgaf Anagarsson himself. Several thousand Jotun, with a vanguard of massively heavy-armoured Skjaldir at their head. A siege is laid and for a very short time it looks as if the Empire's advance might end here. 
Unfortunately for the Jotun, two days after the first clash, the rest of the Imperial armies arrive from the north. News of the Jotun forces reaches the ears of the [[Kallavesi]] among the Winterfolk armies, and with Skyfall Waste secured, they crash against the flanks of the Jotun defenders.
The Viheltavathorn falls before the Imperial hammer. Jarls Olgaf and Klarra try to hold the gates of the tower themselves, buying time for their forces to retreat, and when the rubble of the shattered [[Fortification|fortification]] is searched their bodies are found, back to back, buried in the broken stone. At first there are wild rumours that Mathilda Fisher has perished alongside her ally. More than a dozen Marchers describe seeing her struck down by a blow from a bill that shattered ribs and spilled her bowels to the floor. It certainly sounds like a fatal blow - but there is no sign of her body among the fallen - nor can anyone identify who actually landed the fatal blow.
With or without Mathilda, the remaining Fishers retreat alongside their Jotun allies, and as soon as the last Jotun resistance is crushed the Empire's armies follow suit with the [[Bounders]] leading [[The Way|the way]]. The self-styled [[Steward]] of Bregasland will not escape Marcher justice again.
## Tromsdalen and the Battle of Oksenesfestsal
West of Rikskog lies Tromsdalen, and another Jotun [[Fortification|fortification]]. The region itself is rough and hilly, with perpetually snow-capped and cloud-wrapped mountains to the east. The region nestled between these high peaks, and the great Mount Majastind that lies in the centre of Tromsa.
The mountains of Tromsdalen are part of the same range as Eyrarfell, and on their eastern edge stands the ''Oksenesfestsal'', a commanding Fortification that also served as the seat of the Jarl of Tromsa himself before his death. The castle is massive – a match for the Castle of Thorns in [[Astolat]] – although there are signs that it has been expanded to its current size only within the last few years. More importantly, perhaps, there are signs that the structure is reinforced with [[Adamant]] – the same almost indestructible stone of the [[Summer Realm|Summer realm]] used in the construction of the [[Adamant]] [[Gate]] in [[Semmerholm]], or the Court of the White Fountain in [[Redoubt]]. Three high towers surmount a massive curtain wall; the highest fashioned after the horned head of a massive aurochs. Serpentine dragons coil around the other two towers, giving a strong indication that this fort has been constructed in part at least with the aid of the Stone King.
The Jotun make a stand here, in the shadow of the mountains. It seems that the castle is under the command of Igya Olgafsdottir, who has some experience of dealing with Imperial armies and is by all accounts well-beloved by both the ''King Under [[The Mountain|the Mountain]]'' and the ''Queen of Ice and Darkness''. The surviving Jarls of the conquered regions – or their heirs – gather here reinforcing the garrison of the ''Oksenesfestsal'', their banners hanging from the walls alongside those of Tromsa, and the bull-skull banners of Skjaldir, that popular faðir who epitomizes the tenacity of the Jotun people. Yet alongside the red and white banners of the Jotun hangs one single blue [[Banner|banner]] – the banner of the Fishers of Fisher's Rock. The Marchers prepare to assault the castle.
The walls of ''Oksenesfestal'' [[Repel|repel]] assault after assault, Jotun and Imperial troops alike falling left and right. As the Autumn Equinox approaches, it becomes more and more obvious that the Empire's momentum has faltered, absorbed by the adamant walls of the Jotun castle and its tenacious defenders. Yet there can be little doubt that momentum has carried Imperial soldiers further than any Jotun might have imagined in their [[Wildest dreams|wildest dreams]], and seen them camped before the walls of the Jarl of Tromsa's own [[Throne|throne]].
## [[Heroism]], Honour, and Cruelty
As always, the armies of [[Wintermark]] particularly fight heroically, seeking to defeat their opponents rather than slaughter them. This is obvious to all the Jotun they face... and it appears that this attitude is being reciprocated. During the battles of ''Viheltavathorn'' and '' Oksenesfestsal'', it is clear that the Jotun engaged with the people of Wintermark hold back from killing where they do not need to, honouring their Winterfolk opponents. Despite this, some fifteen hundred Imperial soldiers die in the invasion of Tromsa. The Jotun have suffered significantly more serious [[Casualties|casualties]]; the entire garrison of ''Viheltavathorn'', many of the warriors of Icewood, Skyfall Waste, and Rikskog, and a large number of soldiers defending the walls of ''Oksenesfestsal''.
Not everyone shows the honourable [[Restraint|restraint]] of the Jotun and the Winterfolk; the [[General|general]] of the Fire of the South has instructed the Freeborn soldiers that "''We will not execute, we will not attack those retreating. We will not attack the healers.''" This may be a reaction to the violence unleashed by the influence of the [[Winter]] [[Enchantment]] that influenced them in Kahraman. Unfortunately, perhaps, the warrior-knights of [[Tharim]] broadly ignore this instruction. They don't risk Imperial lives to do so, but they relish opportunities to cut down those attempting to flee, and will execute fallen opponents unless a Freeborn captain is present to ensure that they do not. They take great pleasure in singling out healers, too, striking them down with icy-cold blades and chain-bound maces.
Whatever else has happened, it has become clear that Tromsa is a peculiar territory. Perhaps it is due to its presence on the edge of Tsirku; perhaps it is something else. The [[Imperial Orcs]] speak of there being something in the air here; those who feel a connection to warlike ancestors apparently find the voices clearer during the campaign into Tromsa. Those who can hear Sjöfn of the Bittenblade in particular report that it is even easier for them to hear the distant voice of that Jotun ancestor, urging them to fight heroically, gloriously, and revel in the clash of steel on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. Perhaps this is due to some spiritual or magical quality of the territory, or perhaps it is merely a symptom of the way the Imperial Orcs are internalising the lessons of the Illarawm. Another mystery, one that must wait until the fighting is done.
For while the Empire has done well, the fighting is very far from over. Mathilda Fisher is unaccounted for. Three ''fyrds'' have formed, made up of the defenders of Icewood, Skyfall Waste, and Rikskog, rally to the west. The Jarl of Tromsa may have fallen along with Viheltavathorn, but his daughter stands ready to take his place, and she is much more familiar with the heroes and soldiers of the Empire than her father. And much angrier with those who slew him.
More pressingly, there is news of an immense force of Jotun, including ''all'' the armies of Kalsea, having reached Skallahn. They have recaptured all the territory claimed by the Empire last season, and they are ready to march north into Tromsa – or perhaps launch their own raid into Sermersuaq. Either way they might in theory cut off the Imperial retreat – the armies are a long way from the borders of Wintermark. If the Jotun force can take Rikskog, Imperial armies would need to fight their way back through them to reach Imperial territory.
For now, though, the world catches its breath, but any moment now the chaos of the fray will erupt once again, here in the north, beneath the cold charcoal sky.
## Game Information
The Empire does not have a map of Tromsa. Soldiers on the ground are able to cobble together a very rough approximation of where some of the things they have seen are in relation to one another, but nothing more. They are reasonably confident there are seven regions in total, of which they have seen four. The Empire has captured three of the (presumably) seven regions of Tromsa: Icewood (which has the forested quality and is the only region in the territory that borders Sermersuaq), Skyfall Waste (which apparently has the ''skyhaunted'' quality reflecting the proximity of the Northern Lights), and Rikskog. They are one tenth of the way toward capturing Tromsdalen (which has the hills quality). The latter two regions border Skallahn to the south, as does Icewood.
During the invasion of Tromsa, it is clear that the Jotun are engaging with the people of Wintermark differently to the soldiers of other nations. As with the Winterfolk themselves, they seek opportunities to fight rather than kill their enemies; extending quarter and acting honourably or heroically. As such, all [[Casualties|casualties]] taken by the Wintermark armies are reduced by a tenth. This effect continues as long as the Winterfolk continue to fight honourably.
In the process of capturing Rikskog, the Empire destroyed ''Viheltavathorn'' – a rank one fortification – and inflicted significant damage on ''Oksenesfestsal''- a rank three fortification with the ''unbreakable'' quality which means that like the Adamant Gate it cannot fall below 1,000 strength. It can be captured, but not destroyed by mortal means.
In Skyfall Waste, the Empire has captured an [[Ilium]] source. Lake Karnakadatha could be allocated by the [[Imperial Senate]]. It's not clear how ''much'' [[Ilium|ilium]] the lake provides each season, and actually claiming any of that production would rely on the Empire continuing to hold the region.
The Empire appears to have captured a [[Fane]] dedicated to Wise [[Rangara]] in northern Icewood. A small contingent of Imperial troops are watching over the fane but there is no sign that anything threatening is going on there – certainly no sign that Wise Rangara is minded to send out heralds to support the Jotun.
Fyrds
Each region in a Jotun territory generates a fyrd when it is conquered by the Empire. As the Jarl and their warriors are forced to retreat from their lands, they form up into a fyrd, a warband with a military strength of five hundred. A fyrd is unable to act independently of [[Fortifications|fortifications]] or armies in the territory; it will only act to support a Jotun army in the territory or a fortification if there are no armies present..
A region's fyrd may be dismantled by killing the jarl or through other opportunities.
## Participation: Military Units
Any character whose [[Military unit]] was assigned to fight alongside the Green Shield, or the Summer Storm this [[Downtime|downtime]] may choose to have been impacted by the experience of battling in close proximity to large numbers of heralds of [[Eleonaris]], and inspired by the emissaries of Janon. 
Any character whose [[Military unit|military unit]] supported one of these two armies may choose to gain a single temporary hero point even if they do not have the ''hero'' skill. Once spent, this additional point is permanently gone and will have faded entirely by the end of the Autumn Equinox regardless. If you choose to claim this benefit, however, you also experience a powerful [[Roleplaying effect|roleplaying effect]]: ''you feel driven to get take action, especially in pursuit or defence of the things you care for most. Whether a person or an ideal, it is easy for you to act without thinking when you feel that thing is in danger, or hen an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to support it presents itself.''
The roleplaying effect is particularly strong for anyone who already has the [[Changeling]] or [[Naga]] [[Lineage|lineage]].
## Falling (Battle [[Opportunity]])
Shortly before the Equinox, horns are sounded and a parley called by the defenders of Oksenesfestal, who wish to meet with the commanders of the Imperial armies in Tromsa. 
OOC NoteThe laws of drama demand that any battle in Tromsa this event include an opportunity to capture Mathilda Fisher. Unfortunately, the member of crew who portrays her is not able to attend our final event this year. Given the intense roleplaying that has taken place between Mathilda and the Marchers, we did not feel it was appropriate to even attempt to recast the part.
Therefore, we've constructed a narrative fiction for the battle which will give the Empire an opportunity to lay their hands on Mathilda Fisher, even though she is not at the event. If the players choose to take the battle - and they triumph - then Mathilda will be escourted to the Wintermark camp during the first event next year. While this delay is not what we would like, we've decided this is the best way to give the players a chance to pursue this goal in Tromsa.
A small group of Jotun and Yegarra meet representatives of the Empire atop a battle-scarred hill within bow-shot of both armies. Igya Olgafsdottir herself – now Jarl of Tromsa - leads the Jotun contingent along with the much older Jarl of Kierheim. Flanked by heavily armoured Skjaldir, she is accompanied by a single Yegarra in the blue livery of the Fishers. She addresses most of her comments to the Winterfolk, but acknowledges the others present.
What follows is a fascinating exercise in Jotun diplomacy. She refuses all demands to surrender the fortification to the Empire, seemingly unconcerned with the losses her people will suffer should the castle be stormed. She does not deny that her forces are utterly outmatched by the Imperial armies gathered against her, but she is at pains to point out that the Empire cannot take the castle before her allies in Skallahn come north to lift the siege of Oksenesfestal. 
The Jarl likewise refuses all demands to hand over Mathilda Fisher. She claims that the "Jarl of Bregasland" was a loyal and true ally of her father and that the ancestors would turn their faces from any Jotun who gave her up to her enemies. Worse, the Fisher Queen has been badly wounded and even now lies close to death. Mathilda wishes nothing more than to do her duty and take the field against the Empire with the other Jotun, but she lacks even the strength to draw herself upright in her bed.
To save Mathilda from the dishonour of not taking the field, the Jarl proposes that the champions of the Empire meet with the champions of the Jotun in an honour battle near the woods on Crows Field at the height of the Equinox. The Fishers will take the field carrying Mathilda's banner into battle, along with their Jotun allies. If the Empire can take it from them, then Mathilda will acknowledge her defeat on the battlefield and surrender to Imperial forces. If the Empire do not take the field - or they fail to capture her banner, then the Jarls will not permit her to surrender to the Empire. Igya claims ''"We will spirit her away to Fjorknae, far beyond the Empire's reach. Death will find her, but the carrion will not"''.
Jarl Igya has one final request. Not a demand she notes, but a request. She accepts that the Marchers will execute Mathilda if she surrenders to them. Nobody is under any illusions on that score. But she hands an ornate knife to the care of General Osric and asks that it be placed in Mathilda's hands before she is executed. She says the Fisher Jarl is too weak to fight, and their godhi do not believe she will recover her strength now or in the future. Even so, the woman's ancestors will look more kindly on her if she goes to her death armed for battle.
She is clear that it should be this knife and no other, and says that if General Osric values his honour, he will ensure she is buried with it. If the Empire do not claim the banner, then Osric may keep Mathilda's dagger as a worthy treasure for the heroic campaign he and the other Winterfolk and their allies have fought. At least until Mathilda's people have an opportunity to take it back... 
An opportunity to take the field against the Jotun champions at Crows Field in Tromsa has been identified on the Sunday of the Autumn Equinox. 
### Objective: Capture the Blue Eel Banner
* Capture the Blue Eel Banner of Mathilda Fisher
* If the Empire capture the banner, Jarl Igya's champions will escort Mathilda to [[Anvil]] in time for the Winter Solstice
* If the Empire do not capture the banner, Mathilda Fisher will be buried on Fjorknae with all the honour due to a Jotun champion
Mathilda Fisher was mortally wounded during the fall of Viheltavathorn, fighting alongside Jarl Olgaf. She was carried off the battlefield by her allies, but the traumatic wound is beyond the reach of [[Magic|magic]] or the art of the chrirurgeon to fix. The Jarl's physics have bound her wounds as best they can, buying her precious months at most, but she can barely stand let alone take the battlefield.
The Imperial armies have publicly proclaimed their intention to capture the Fisher Queen and bring her back to [[Anvil]] to face Imperial justice. Jotun honour demands that she face the Empire in spirit, even if she cannot face them in person, so Jarl Igya has agreed that her Blue Eel Banner will be present to represent her. If the Empire can capture the banner and take it from the field, then an honour guard of Jotun champions will convey Mathilda to the wintermark camp in Anvil to face justice in time for the Winter Solstice.
If the Empire are not able to capture the banner, then the Jotun jarls plan to inter her with the full honours they would give a fellow jarl, raising a cairn over her body surmounted by the symbols of her enemies. It should be impossible for her to become an ancestor, that defies everyone anyone knows about orcs and humans. None-the-less her victories over the Empire in Bregasland will serve as an inspiration to the Fishers and to some rebellious yegarra for years to come. The fact that she ultimately lost, will only add to that effect, Jotun heroes are ''supposed'' to die in battle against a worthy foe.
### Objective: Defeat Feather'd Rain
* Feather'd Rain, a bird-faced herald of the Pale Raven who gives advice and counsel to the Jarl of Tromsa will be observing the battlefield
* Attacking Feather'd Rain would be distinctly unhelpful, killing them will certainly anger Grandmother Winter
* If they can be defeated in a challenge of riddles, they will provide advice to Imperial forces in Tromsa for a year and a day rather than the Jarl
The Jarl of Tromsa has longed benefitted from good relations with Wise Rangara who the Jotun call the Pale Raven due to the presence of her face in the territory. Feather'd Rain, a wise herald who can sometimes be found at the fane comes and goes as they please in the Jarl's court. On occasion the jarls will go to the herald for advice, but Feather'd Rain is an honoured guest, permitted to go where they please and speak their mind to whomever they please. Even Kings and Queens fall silent when Feather'd Rain speaks.
The herald plans to take the battlefield, not to fight, but to observe proceedings. Based on what is known of them they are likely to wander the battlefield watching what people are doing and offering unlooked for advice. Attacking the herald would be a bad idea, but killing them would be disastrous. Grandmother Winter will be angry with the Empire, she will redouble the aid she gives the Jotun and is likely to cause trouble for Imperial citizens. While she is commonly viewed as a kindly grandmother by young [[Children|children]], she is also know as the Cruel Lady - though never to her face.
However Feather'd Rain is known to enjoy riddles, as do many of Wise Rangara's heralds. If her herald is challenged by Imperial citizens then she will offer up to three riddles. If the Empire answers them all correctly, first time, then Feather'd Rain will acknowledge their [[Wisdom|wisdom]]. If that happens then she will give her counsel and aid to any Imperial forces in Tromsa, rather than to the Jotun, for a year and a day.
### Objective: Defeat Sigurn Olgafsson
* Sigurn Olgafsson is a Summerborn champion of [[Cathan Canae]]
* Defeating Sigurn will allow the players to claim the Belt of the White Bear
* If Sigurn triumphs on the field of battle he will be able to form his own warband
Sigurn Olgafsson is Igya's younger brother, a skilled warrior and a summerborn champion of Queen of Ice and Darkness. He is one of Igya's most loyal supporters, publicly backing her for the seat of Tromsa on their father's death. In [[Recognition|recognition]] of his support in favour of pressing his own claim, she has promised him the [[Mithril|mithril]] he needs to equip his own warband if he is victorious on the battlefield against the Empire. He will be on the battlefield leading a group of Jotun champions looking to hold one of the flanks.
To help protect her beloved brother for the coming year, Igya has called on the aid of her patron, the ''Lady of the Frost'' to help her fashion a powerful magical belt for Sigurn. According to the rumours, the Belt of the White Bear grants the wearer extraordinary endurance, provided that they are a competent artisan. If the Empire can defeat Sigurn they could steal the belt or compel Sigurn to give it up in lieu of his life if they prefer not to rob his corpse.
If Sigurn survives the battle, he will use the [[Mithril|mithril]] that the Jarl has secured for him to equip his own small warband, allowing the Jotun to field another fast-moving independent military unit with a strength (initially at least) of 500. This will only happen if the Empire take the battle and Sigurn survives. He will have to wait for another chance to prove himself if he is denied battle at the Autumn Equinox.
## Despise the Pretender (Conjunction)
* A warband of Jotun are moving to travel through a pass to reinforce Oksenesfestsal
* The [[Sentinel Gate]] will open at 18:30 on Friday to Nordbotn, Tromsdalen, Tromsa
* This skirmish is a [[Combat|combat]] highly likely encounter
* The ''[[Champion of Pride]]'' is responsible for holding the palisade
The forward momentum of the Imperial armies has slowed in the face of Oksenesfestsal, but the Empire still camps beneath the walls of the Jarl of Tromsa's throne. Now the fyrds of the territory are on the move to support the Jotun's resistance against the Empire. Reinforcements for the garrison are travelling towards the Nordbotn pass; a narrow valley that leads from the north to Tromsdalen. ''Henry of Stoke'', a [[Beater|beater]] of the Bounders and a pilgrim of [[Pride]], has asked the [[Champion of Pride]] to make sure that the warband doesn't make it through the pass. If they manage that then the beaters of the Bounders will be able to move into position to prevent reinforcements from reaching the fortification. If the warband is not stopped then the reinforcements will be able to reach Oksenesfestsal resupplying the fortification by five hundred strength before the coming season.
The warband is made up of a combined force of Raoljost, Ulvenwar, and Skjaldir and will be arriving at the palisade a few minutes after [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] Gate opens. Given that this is a direct request to the Champion of [[Pride]], it is the responsibility of the incumbent, Kali Keen-Eye, to prevent the Jotun from travelling through the pass.
## Claim the Just Rewards (Conjunction)
* A warband of Jotun are defending a small fort in Rikskog
* The [[Sentinel]] Gate will open at 19:00 on Friday to Fniskard's Palisade, Rikskog, Tromsa
* This skirmish is a [[Combat|combat]] highly likely encounter
* The ''[[Champion of Prosperity]]'' is responsible for claiming the cache of supplies from the Jotun
Though the Empire has claimed Rikskog from the Jotun there are still Jotun in the region. One such warband has managed to gather resources intended for Viheltavathorn at a long abandoned small fort near the border to Skyfall Waste. Any advance by Imperial troops towards the are would see the warband scatter taking the cache of supplies with them, but a precise strike by Imperial heroes? Then the trove of artisans oil, [[Herbs|herbs]], and artisanal weapons and armour could be claimed for the Empire. ''Sharpeye Thrakka'', a [[Reaver|reaver]] with the Summer Storm, has asked the Champion of [[Prosperity]] to claim the resources from the Jotun and put them to use for the Empire.
The warband is made up of a combined force of Raoljost, Ulvenwar, and Skjaldir. Given that this is a direct request to the [[Champion of Prosperity]], to help claim the just rewards of the Empire's labours, it is the responsibility of the incumbent, Hugh Farrier, to oust the Jotun from the fort and claim the resources.
