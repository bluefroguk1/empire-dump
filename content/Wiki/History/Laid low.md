## While Old Marjoram Sleeps
Mathilda Fisher is still in [[Bregasland]]. Her [[Family|family]] still claims the [[Territory|territory]] is the “Free Bregas” and she's been profligate with her promises to the households who've remained in the conquered territory. There's talk of a council of stewards, to advise the woman who seems to be planning to rule as queen in all but name. She's sent out Fisher [[Storytellers|storytellers]] to spread twisted tales of [[Bregasland]]'s past, casting Tom Drake as a betrayer who betrayed the households to [[The Empire|the Empire]] during the Cousin's [[War]]. Their stories are pernicious, casting the Fisher's who quit their homes to hide out in the western marshes, who fled to [[Hordalant]], as valiant [[Heroes|heroes]] rather than defeated traitors. Some listen. Most don't. There are too many orcs in Bregasland for most Bregas to lend more than half an ear to tales of courageous Fishers here to liberate their kin from the Imperial yoke.
That said, [[The Empire|the Empire]] might have underestimated how much trouble Old Bushel Sykes would cause, in the long run. He's never been popular – a dour Bregas of infamously sour temperament – but his [[Family|family]] line goes far back into the distant past of the territory, and it is said the dark waters of the fenlands runs in his veins. 
Before Mathilda Fisher came to Bregasland, he never had a good word for anyone. That's changed, recently. Old Marjoram stayed asleep in her swamp, so he's succeeded in helping the [[Jotun]] expand the Otterway. It's been transformed from a driveway just about wide enough for a couple of wagons to a major causeway that can easily take twenty soldiers walking abreast. If that was the extent of his treachery, it'd be bad enough. But there's more to it than that.
Rise up! For months we have haunted the [[Jotun]]'s steps, attacked supply lines and gave them no rest. Our [[Courage|courage]] and [[Loyalty|loyalty]] is legendary and the Empire now turns its gaze to Bregasland. So rise up [[Strong Reeds|strong reeds]] and follow me. The fire of [[The Marches|the marches]] burns bright and [[Will|will]] burn their armies to ash and put an end to queen fisher with an overwhelming assault. Rise Up! Make them rue the [[Day|day]] they stepped on marcher land. Bregasland stands.
	We have rested and used our time wisely to build the craft to cross the Gullet at last. Now it’s the time we have waited for; onward to Bregasland, to the North Fens and remove Fisher from her seat at Fisher's Rock then join up with the [[Strong Reeds]] in Grey Fens before joining up with the other armies in the Rushes.
He's rounded up a force of beaters and dropped poisoned words into their ears encouraging them to share their fenlore with the Fishers and their orc allies. They're no match for House Greywater or the Strong Reeds, but in the wake of the [[Winter]] Solstice they're getting closer to rooting out some of the hidden places the good Marchers are using to lay low. 
Worse still, he's been going from household to household with stolen [[Liao|liao]], sowing the seeds of [[Loyalty]] wherever he finds someone who shares his views about the Empire. By all accounts Bushel is no great friend of the Fishers or the Jotun, but while he may not like ''them'' he absolutely ''despises'' the Empire. Folk who might not give Mathilda Fisher and her clan the time of day, are much more receptive to his argument that [[The Marches|the Marches]] made a mistake, and should have told the [[First Empress]] they'd have ''none of us'' at the start.
For all that he's good with venomous words and a sack of [[Liao|liao]], he's just one man. The real power in Bregasland remains the Jotun, there at the behest of Mathilda Fisher. They're busy extending the Otterway even more, in the weeks after the Winter Solstice, stretching the new construction down toward Graven Rock. Perhaps they think that by linking it to “proper solid ground” it'll make it more effective. More likely, with [[Liathaven]] under their control, it's about making it easier to transport [[White granite|white granite]] into the fenlands so they can start properly fortifying the territory.
Whatever the facts are, the one thing they don't do is invade [[Mitwold]]. Probably they expect the Empire to be waiting for them if they follow through on their telegraphed move immediately. [[Mitwold]] isn't going anywhere, though. They have time, surely?
The flaw in their strategy, if that is what they expect, is that the Empire ''doesn't'' wait for them to invade Mitwold. 
## How Do They Rise Up, Rise Up High?
Our siblings of [[Highguard]] say now is the time of miracles. I [[Challenge|challenge]] you, soldiers of the [[Fist of the Mountains]]. What inspiration have you gained from a season's rest and reflection among the Spints of Masi, in the sacred and consecrated spiritual home of the Winterfolk? Are you refreshed, renewed, inspired? Take this energy and use it now. We march against the Jotun puppet Yegarra, a Symbol of the Perversions of the tradition the Jotun inflict on those they have conquered and enthralled. Winterfolk, I say no more. No More Jotun lies, Jotun puppets, Jotun massacre of not only our bodies, but our souls, our traditions, our magics. We move to the North Fens, the to Grey fens to join the fire of the [[Marches|marches]], and if you have any left to give, the Rushes. Meet our Imperial Siblings, march with them, never let them forget who we are, or who THEY are.
[[Heroes]] of the Second Legion, [[Summer Storm]]. We have all fought hard and well, and I am only too proud that you have decided to keep me as your [[General|general]]! Now, the plan. We [[Will|will]] be assisting our Imperial Allies in the retaking of Bregasland. As our sister legion fights in the Battens against the [[Druj]] to free slaves, our focus shall be the Jotun, and helping the Marches retake their homeland. From [[Kallavesa]], we will move into Bregasland via Fisher's Rock and the North Fens, Rendezvousing with allies at the Rushes via the Grey Fens as well. From there, we will make a solid attempt to push the Jotun from Imperial territory. We may not be freeing slaves in this instance, but our Allies need help, and we will help them!	
[[Tusks]]. It is time to Jump the Proverbial [[Senate]] Wall. A steady conquest from Graven March begins and we will be the hand that guides the ploughshare churning through the Jotun, until we reach the Fire in the Fens. Bregasland Stands.
The Strong Reeds, working with the patriots of House Greywater, have been lying low in Bregasland. Taunting the Jotun, impeding the Fishers and their orc allies at every turn and making it impossible for the Jotun to secure the territory. Ensuring the Empire stays abreast of what the invaders have been up to. With the aid of those beaters who have ''not'' let Old Bushel Sykes fill their heads with empty promises and lies, they've been preparing to strike. That time has come.
At the [[General]]'s command, they rise up. All across Bregasland, they and their allies strike at key targets – garrisons, roads, stores, and the households of Mathilda's supporters. Among others they are aided by almost every independent captain currently active in the Marches, by beaters equipped with supplies from nearly every [[Farm|farm]] in the nation, by the soldiers of households still loyal to the Marches gathered by one Tom of Otterly (a Marcher rescued from the Fishers during the Winter Solstice by the young heroes of [[The Academy|the academy]]). There is also [[Magic|magic]] at work; warriors drawn from the [[Realm|realm]] of the Lady of the Pennants by Imperial magicians appear overnight once the Strong Reeds begin their attack, enthusiastically aiding the mortal Marchers in their assault. It makes for a strange contrast – glorious knights from [[The Fields of Glory|the Fields of Glory]] in shining plate alongside mud-stained Marcher soldiers and crafty beaters in vicious fights across the Dour Fens.
At the same time the Strong Reeds rise up, their allies cross the river from West Marsh, and lay siege to Mathilda's forces at Fishers Rock. Thanks to the disciplined scouts of the [[Tusks]] and the farsighted seers of the Fist of [[The Mountain|the Mountain]], the timing is nearly perfect. Just as the Fisher's realise the Strong Reeds have arisen, they have a much more pressing problem right on their doorstep. 
The Jotun forces are concentrated in the south – securing the borders with Mitwold. Some of the Mandowla's Roar are stationed in North Fens - “advisors” to the Fishers apparently – but the majority of their forces are focused on the project to expand the Otterway, around Ottery and Sallow.
The Fisher's try desperately to cling to Fisher's Rock, but it soon becomes clear it is fruitless. Even with the Jotun armies mobilising to provide their support, they have little chance of holding against eight [[Imperial armies]] – especially when two of those armies are the [[Drakes]] and the [[Summer Storm]]. Fisher's Rock falls.
After the initial [[Confusion|confusion]], the Jotun rally, their armies moving to support their human allies. Battle rages across the fens, and it quickly becomes clear that the defenders are outmatched by the Empire's sheer number, and by their commitment to the attack. 
==Blood, Mud, and Fire== 
When the Jotun first came, when they first conquered Bregasland for Mathilda Fisher, they threw their entire strength toward their goal and so it is with the Empire. This is an overwhelming assault – the [[Drakes]] and the Fist of [[The Mountain|the Mountain]] in the vanguard eager to face the yegarra and their Jotun allies. As always the Winterfolk [[Fight|fight]] heroically, matching the honour of the Jotun. Fewer orcs die, but they are more able to claim territory from the invaders. 
If [[Wintermark]] is carful to avoid needless slaughter, this is more than made up for by the [[Navarr]] of [[Isaella]]'s Dance. Their envenomed weapons may kill quickly and without undue suffering, but they still ''kill''. Even a nick from one of their spears can be enough to leave a Fisher or a Jotun weak or paralysed, or thin their blood so they die swiftly of their other wounds.
[[Freeborn]], we march. It is time for us to bring hope to the people of Bregasland. We will show them our loyalty as we meet these Jotun and oust Mathilda Fisher before she becomes comfortable putting down her roots. With our [[Ambition]] hunt out Stephen of Sarcombe and show what happens when [[Courage|courage]] fails him in fleeing [[Kahraman]].
The [[Summer]] Storm, the Tusks, and the Freeborn of the [[Fire of the South]] are more balanced in their strategies. While the [[Imperial Orcs]] are empowered with supernatural clarity that helps them head off their foes with a balanced attack, the other two armies adopt strategies that [[Make good use|make good use]] of the number of physicks, chirurgeons, and masters of healing [[Magic|magic]] that accompany them. A wise decision, given the risk of sickness and infection that fighting in the fens presents.
At the forefront of all this, though, are a new army. Brightly dressed warrior Freeborn, blazing with the flames of a [[Legacy|legacy]] reborn. The [[Burning Falcon]] seem to be everywhere at once seeking every [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to engage the descendants of the Jotun orcs who once destroyed their forebears in battle. The mud and dark water should make short work of their bright yellows, their brilliant oranges, and their crimson cloth but it seems almost as if the fens dare not sully their finery. A rumour quickly spreads that they can literally charge across open water, a story that while ridiculous makes the Fisher's loathe to face them. Not so the Jotun – they seem to relish the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to [[Fight|fight]] the [[Burning]] Falcon, and some clearly recognising the bird-of-prey banners, engaging them for preference wherever they have the opportunity. 
## The Fall is Not A Small One
North Fens is [[Liberated|liberated]] almost before the defenders know what is happening; the fight for Gray Fens is more drawn out but no less decisive. The Fishers are scattered, the Jotun driven back. They defend as best they can, but it is clear pretty quickly which way the battle here is going to go. The Jotun do not like fighting in the marshes, which sometimes gives the advantage to the Imperial soldiers with their solid [[Beater|beater]] support. Often enough, however, the orcs have the advice of their own beaters – both traitor Marcher and Fisher - and keen-eyed scouts who help them to find good defensible positions in the mire.
The Jotun and their Lasambrian Pets have fled before our assault. They know they cannot stand against us. We now turn our attention to Bregasland and the Jotun puppet Matilda Fisher. We strike at Grevensmarch at her seat of powers, Fisher's Rock. These traitors will fall before our poison thorns.
[[Kohan]]! After a century we rise again to smash the Jotun. The Marches have waited and we will show our loyalty to the Empire. Breathe deep, steel yourselves, gather your [[Pride|pride]] [[Pride]] and bring it directly to our enemies doorstep and beyond.
After Gray Fens, the Imperial advance slows a little. The Jotun are more comfortable fighting in the Rushes and Ottermire – there are more settlements here, more solid ground for them to plant their heavily armoured feet on, firmer soil for them to fix their banners in. The Fell Hammers and the Mandowla's Roar take the brunt of the Empire's attacks. General Jakkan of the Fell Hammers takes particular pains to engage the [[Imperial Orcs]] but where they are not present, they seem to relish the opportunity to match blades with the soldiers of the Marches. They take few pains to support the Fishers – by all accounts the Fell Hammers have been the most critical of the Jotun about the alliance with the humans, calling for the Jotun to conquer the Marches for themselves.
The other two armies – the ferocious champions of the Roaring Thunder and the more [[Mystic|mystic]] Ulvenwar and Raðljóst of the Howling [[Night]] – seem to have a little more respect for the humans that fight alongside them, supporting them whenever they can. For all the good it does.
As the [[Spring]] Equinox approaches, Mathilda Fisher's dreams of Free Bregas are in tatters. The Empire controls both Fens, the Rushes, and has occupied parts of Ottermire. The Jotun are regrouping near Graven Rock. Her warriors are scattered. Fisher's Rock is firmly in the hands of the Imperial armies. Many of those fair-weather households who were prepared to pay lip service to her conquest of the Bregas have welcomed the Marcher armies in particular with open arms.
An yet, despite all of that, she refuses to give up. The call goes out for all those who still support the dream of Free Bregas to gather beneath her blue eel banners in preparation for a retreat. There is no talk of surrender, no talk of abandoning her claim to be the rightful [[Steward|steward]] of Bregasland. Perhaps, given her stubbornness, she really is a Marcher at heart.
Her ambitions have come at a high price, again. On top of all those who have died since she first pressed her claim to Bregasland, an estimated four thousand fighters have fallen in battle. The final number may prove to be much higher. Most of the dead fell to the weapons of their foes, a few to the quagmires and deceptive waters, and the vicious wildlife of the fens. The lion's share of those deaths are on the Imperial side – the Jotun have fought to defend and to preserve their strength in face of the Empire's reckless, forceful assault. 
In many cases, the bodies of the dead are lost, claimed by the marshes. The fens embrace fallen humans and orcs, slain Imperials, Free Bregas, and Jotun, the courageous and the treacherous, with equal, uncaring, indifference. 
## Game Information
Bregasland is an Imperial territory once again. During the Spring Equinox it will be up to the [[Imperial Senate]] as to which nation to assign the Dour Fens.
Mathilda Fisher's hold on the territory has been broken, but with the help of traitors such as Old Bushel Sykes she has managed to cling to some of her support among some of the Bregasland households. If she is able to retreat out of Bregasland with her allies she will remain a potential threat during any future Jotun invasion of the Dour Fens.
Work on the Otterway was completed before the Imperial assault, so in theory the region of Oddmire is still under threat of invasion.
## Participation
The experience of fighting in close proximity with the [[Knights of Glory]] can be particularly inspirational, especially if one already has a trace of [[Summer magic]] in their blood. Any [[Changeling]] character whose [[Military unit]] supported the Strong Reeds may choose to begin the next event experiencing a [[Roleplaying effect|roleplaying effect]]: ''You are filled with confidence; nothing is beyond you if you put your mind to it. Now is the time to act, to pursue goals you have been neglecting. Anyone who questions your prowess must be taught a quick lesson about the foolishness of doubting you.'' Such [[Characters|characters]] may also use their experience of fighting alongside the knights of [[Glory|glory]] to permanently increase the strength of their [[Lineage]].
This effect is particularly pronounced for changelings of the Marches whose [[Military unit]] supported the Strong Reeds if they also have the hero skill. As long as they continue to roleplay appropriately, they will have an additional, temporary hero point that they can use during the Spring Equinox event. Once this hero point is spent, or once the event ends, the bonus hero point is [[Gone|gone]] (it is not an increase to the character's maximum hero points). 
Please bear in mind that these [[Opportunities|opportunities]] are ''only'' available to these specific [[Characters|characters]]. You are free to roleplay you were present, as always, but you do not qualify for the additional hero point unless your Military unit supported the Strong Reeds this season.
## Battle Opportunity
A major conjunction of the [[Sentinel Gate]] has been identified that will allow heroes of the Empire to reach Bregasland during the upcoming Spring Equinox. Details of the conjunction are being prepared by the civil service, but it is believed to involve a chance to end the ambitions of Mathilda Fisher once and for all.
## Through the moonlight (Conjunction)
* A band of Jotun have been spotted moving to raze the holdings of House Greywater
* If they are not stopped then the Greywater household will be ruined
* [[The Sentinel]] [[Gate]] will open at 19:00 on Friday to Greywater Estates in North Fens
* The ''General of the Strong Reeds'' has been asked to intercept and rout the Jotun
A band of Jotun are on the move and will arrive at the holdings of House Greywater shortly after the Spring Equinox. ''Henry Greywater'', a Beater who has been accompanying some of the Strong Reeds during their time in Bregasland, spotted the band leaving the estate of House Brawness and overheard their plans to raze Greywater's lands. With the majority of the Greywaters supporting the Strong Reeds and the other Marcher armies in pushing out the Fishers their holdings are left defenceless. Margary Greywater, [[Steward|steward]] of the household, has asked once again for the aid of the General of the Strong Reeds as without help the household will lose all their wealth.
House Brawness have previously kept as neutral as possible in the ongoing conflict in Bregasland but they have long had a feud with the Greywaters, apparently going back generations over an accusation of moving boundary stones. If Henry Greywater is right and House Brawness have allowed the Jotun to rest and recuperate on their estate then there may even be a case for treason.
The band is made up of a combined force of Raoljost, Ulvenwar, and Skjaldir. Given that Margary Greywater has specifically requested the aid of the General of the Strong Reeds it is the responsibility of the General, Amberlain P. Black, to rout the Jotun.
