### Reign: 380 YE - 383 YE
### Called: of Flowers, the Patron
### Early Life and Election
The eldest child of Elise Giacomi of [[Tassato]], and Gyorgy Yakovitch of [[Temeschwar]], the young Empress-to-be excelled at the study of [[Music|music]] and philosophy at the prestigious University of [[Tassato]]. After completing her studies, she was reluctantly drawn back into her [[Family|family]]’s long-established Temeschwari [[Business|business]], the Hearthfire [[Guild]] of Arms and Artisans, and six years ago set up a new branch in [[Holberg]] after succeeding her mother as Prince of that [[Guild|guild]].
Her rise in the political sphere has been remarkable. Shortly after arriving at her first [[Anvil]] Summit in the [[Winter]] of 378YE, she was appointed [[Conscience of the Senate]] by the then [[Cardinal of the Way]] Beodun Snowlock. She served her year’s term with distinction and immediately afterwards took on the role of [[Proxy|proxy]] to the [[Warmage]], carrying out the full responsibility of that role during the storm-wracked summit of Winter 379YE. She announced her [[Candidacy|candidacy]] for [[The Throne|the Throne]] shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice of 379YE and it took nearly a year of hard work to achieved the support of [[The Senate|the Senate]]. 
Finally, during the [[Spring]] Equinox 380YE, Lisabetta von [[Holberg]] was elected as [[The twentieth empress|the twentieth Empress]].
### Reign
At her coronation during the Summer Solstice 380YE, Lisabetta was crowned with a coronet of summer flowers woven by the young [[Heroes|heroes]] of [[The Academy|the Academy]], rather than with the Imperial Crown. During the Spring Equinox 381YE, Lisabetta became the first [[Throne]] since [[Empress Brannan]] to be crowned monarch of [[Dawn]].
One of her first actions after taking [[The Throne|the Throne]] was to establish the Imperial Offices, an [[Imperial Sodality]] dedicated to supporting the Throne in the performance of their duties and the furtherance of the Imperial agenda.
At the [[Autumn]] Equinox of 382, following an announcement earlier in the year of her intention to marry, [[Empress Lisabetta]] married Juha the Cave Spider of [[Varushka]] in a private ceremony held in the [[Senate]] building during the [[Anvil]] summit.
### Death and [[Legacy]]
At the Summer Solstice 383YE, Lisabetta Giacomi von Holberg disappeared. The one thing that is known for certain is that the [[Egregores|egregores]] of [[The League|the League]] confirmed that they could no longer sense her.  After careful deliberation, the Constitutional Court has confirmed the Throne must be legally considered to either be dead or to have resigned her position. 
More details can be found in the Autumn 383YE [[Winds of Fortune]].
