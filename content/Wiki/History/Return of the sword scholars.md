## Overview
The sword scholars and their founder [[Sulemaine]] i Taziel have been a controversial part of [[Urizen History|Urizen history]] since their foundation in pre-Imperial times. Their commitment to challenging outside influences on [[Urizen]] society, especially outside spiritual influences, eventually saw them suppressed and driven underground in the reign of [[Emperor Giovanni]]. In recent years, however, their philosophies have been re-examined, and their movement has been thrust into the spotlight of Imperial affairs - with mixed results.
## Early [[History]]
:[[Sword scholar]]
The Disciples of the [[Tempest jade|Tempest Jade]] Maiden wish a [[Judgement|judgement]] on their Virtue. In order that as many members of the national [[Assembly|assembly]] as possible may [[Witness|witness]] their statements about their philosophy and in doing so we gain true knowledge rather than hearsay, we summon senior brothers “Marcus” and “Atticus” to [[Inquisition|inquisition]] in the Endsmeet Tent on Friday of the [[Autumn]] Equinox 381 YE at 8pm.
We the [[Urizen]] [[National Assembly]] recognise that the teachings of the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden encourage Virtuous action. Consequently we believe that they and other [[Groups|groups]] of sword scholars are following teachings that promote virtue. This follows the [[Inquisition|inquisition]] on the Saturday of this summit.
## Temple of the Four Winds
In [[Summer]] 381YE, Edmundo of Urizen worked with the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden to arrange an Inquisition of two sword scholars, with the stated intention of gaining "true knowledge rather than hearsay" about the modern movement. The inquisition took place during the Autumn Equinox, and culminated in vindication of the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden. 
Next year, in [[Spring]] 382YE, Edmundo presented a [[Statement of Principle]] to the Urizen [[Assembly]], calling for the sword scholars to unite under the [[Banner|banner]] of the Tempest Jade Maiden. The sword scholars responded cautiously but positively to these overtures, and [[Opportunities|opportunities]] were presented during Summer that year to reconcile the sword scholars with the nation and [[The Empire|the Empire]]. 
Both the [[Wisdom]] assembly [[Mandate]] and the Urizen assembly [[Mandate|mandate]] were enacted, and [[The Senate|the Senate]] commissioned the reconstruction of the Temple of the Winds in [[Morrow]] to serve as a central temple for the movement. While some people may have been skeptical of the reconciliation, the Severein encyclical muffled any dissent.
Preparations to rebuild the ancient temple were interrupted by the [[Druj]] invasion of [[Morrow]]. When the [[Barbarian|barbarian]] orcs attacked the construction site, nearly two-thirds of the sword scholars were slaughtered. It took almost a year for [[The Empire|the Empire]] to free the area from [[Druj]] control and complete the work to restore the temple.
## The Wise Test
Meanwhile the progression of the Grey Pilgrims across the Empire had caused concern in almost all the Imperial nations. During the Summer Solstice, the Urizen Assembly encouraged the sword scholars to engage in spirited debate with the Grey Pilgrims who had begun questioning spiritual attitudes in the Imperial nations. This led, in Summer, to a mandate declaring the study of [[Sulemaine]] to be acceptable which the [[General|general]] assembly upheld despite some dissent.
With construction of the Temple finally completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 383YE, the sword scholars had a focal point around which to rebuild their philosophy. The Urizen Assembly appointed the first [[Envoy to the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden]], whose responsibilities included liaising with the surviving [[Sword scholar|sword scholar]] sects, and presenting their philosophy at [[Anvil]] and to the [[Urizen People|Urizen people]] as a whole. 
Once the work on the Temple was complete, the mandate that the [[Wisdom]] assembly had previously passed came into effect, though their full force would not be felt until the Autumn Equinox. This mandate encouraged ''all'' the virtuous to take inspiration from Sulemaine and the sword scholars. In particular, they were urged to actively [[Challenge|challenge]] anyone who wishes to spread the imperatives of [[The Synod|the Synod]] to justify their actions with reason and logic, effectively opposing the mandates of the [[Imperial Synod]] at every turn. As a result, it became much more difficult for the [[Synod]] to enact its [[Will|will]]. At the same time, the Urizen Assembly [[Judgement|judgement]] calling on the sword scholars to organise at home meant that, even in the absence of the Wisdom Assembly mandate, Urizen would still be resistant to Synod mandates.
During the Autumn Equinox 383YE, there was spirited debate about the role of the sword scholars. The Urizen Assembly continued to support the sword scholars unequivocally, enacting a mandate to declare that "''the [[Paragon]] of Blades is the perfect epitome of the Urizeni spirit - pure calculating reason unhindered by emotion or pity.' The mandate caused a surge of support for the sword scholars, creating an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to build fortified temples in Morrow (and the other [[Urizen Territories|Urizen territories]] should they be recaptured). It also meant that the power of the Synod over Urizeni citizens was further attenuated. Only in [[Redoubt]] was there any real resistance to the rise of the sword scholars; the presence of so many sentinels there made the idea of large gatherings of Sulemaine's scions unpalatable.
The Virtuous apply what they have learned: the Sword Scholars undermine this with their ruthless and indiscriminate opposition to the expressed [[Will|will]] of the Synod. Their founder, Sulemaine i Taziel, taught them to browbeat, silence, and murder any who raised a dissenting voice. They would rather strike down a soul seeking the right question than face an unwelcome truth. We should stand against such narrow minded and dogmatic behaviour. Those of scholarly inclination should look to the Exemplars [[Kala]] Windward and [[Avigliana di Sarvos]], not to Sulemaine i Taziel. Above all, we should not let the will of the Synod be stymied by followers of a lawless [[Sect|sect]] whose philosophy promotes silence, shame, and inaction.
Debate is necessary and laudable, but obstructing the Synod's capacity to act and [[Guide|guide]] our citizens on [[The Way|the Way]] is not. If the sword scholars truly wish to improve and influence the quality of Imperial thinking let them do so by participating in the [[Business|business]] and processes of the [[Imperial Synod]], not by obstructing its ability to act.
## Chastise [[Folly]]
Unsurprisingly the Synod has not welcomed this [[Challenge|challenge]] to its power. Autumn 383YE saw two significant statements of principle raised and upheld with greater majorities that rebuked the sword scholars for their beliefs and practices. The [[General Assembly]] agreed with Rafael Barossa di [[Tassato]], who described the sword scholars in incendiary terms as "''followers of a lawless sect whose philosophy promotes silence, shame, and inaction''" and said Sulemaine i Taziel "''taught them to browbeat, silence, and murder any who raised a dissenting voice. They would rather strike down a soul seeking the right question than face an unwelcome truth''". He called for the virtuous to "''stand against such narrow minded and dogmatic behaviour''"
Clarice Novarion (the [[Cardinal of Courage]]) led the [[Assembly of the Nine]] who agreed that "''debate is necessary and laudable''" but made clear that "''obstructing the Synod's capacity to act and guide our citizens on [[The Way|the Way]] is not''." They - and the unanimous Assembly of the Nine - said that "''if the sword scholars truly wish to improve and influence the quality of Imperial thinking let them do so by participating in the business and processes of the Imperial Synod, not by obstructing its ability to act''."
At the same time several statements were upheld by the Urizen National Assembly. Clytemnestra of the House of [[The Wanderer|the Wanderer]] encouraged "''all sword scholars to act within [[Imperial Law|Imperial law]] in the prosecution of their virtuous challenges''" and said that "''with our increased responsibilities comes increased obligation to virtue''." A further statement by Cato Hypation which said that "''the title "Paragon of Blades" is exactly that, a title. The Synod does not currently recognise Sulemaine i Taziel as a paragon of virtue. The Urizen assembly do not contest this''" was upheld, but did not receive a [[Greater majority]] - while the mandate declaring the Paragon of Blades to be the epitome of the Urizen spirit absolutely did.
After the Autumn Equinox, several mandates that might otherwise have been enacted, failed. This failure was categorically due to the opposition of the sword scholars in Urizen, and the dedicated of Wisdom all over the Empire who now looked to them as an inspiration.
At the [[Winter]] Solstice, several mandates were proposed that would allow the [[General]] Assembly, the Wisdom Assembly, and the Urizen Assembly opportunities to further explore the situation with mandates, and the relationship between Wisdom, sword scholars, and the Imperial Synod.
