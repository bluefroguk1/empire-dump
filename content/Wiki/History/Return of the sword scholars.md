## Overview
The [[Sword scholar|sword scholars]] and their founder [[Sulemaine|Sulemaine i Taziel]] have been a controversial part of [[Urizen]] history since their foundation in pre-Imperial times. Their commitment to challenging outside influences on Urizen society, especially outside spiritual influences, eventually saw them suppressed and driven underground in the reign of [[Emperor Giovanni]]. In recent years, however, their philosophies have been re-examined, and their movement has been thrust into the spotlight of Imperial affairs - with mixed results.
## Early History
:Sword scholar
The Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden wish a judgement on their Virtue. In order that as many members of the national assembly as possible may witness their statements about their philosophy and in doing so we gain true knowledge rather than hearsay, we summon senior brothers “Marcus” and “Atticus” to inquisition in the Endsmeet Tent on Friday of the Autumn Equinox 381 YE at 8pm.
We the Urizen National Assembly recognise that the teachings of the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden encourage Virtuous action. Consequently we believe that they and other groups of sword scholars are following teachings that promote virtue. This follows the inquisition on the Saturday of this summit.
## Temple of the Four Winds
In Summer 381YE, Edmundo of Urizen worked with the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden to arrange an [[Inquisition]] of [[381YE Summer Solstice Synod judgements#Judgement 75|two sword scholars]], with the stated intention of gaining "true knowledge rather than hearsay" about the modern movement. The inquisition [[381YE Autumn Equinox Synod judgements#Judgement 70|took place]] during the Autumn Equinox, and culminated in [[Sanction#Vindication|vindication]] of the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden. 
Next year, in Spring 382YE, Edmundo presented a [[Statement of Principle]] to the Urizen Assembly, calling for the sword scholars to [[382YE Spring Equinox Synod judgements#Judgement 11|unite under the banner of the Tempest Jade Maiden]]. The sword scholars responded cautiously but positively to these overtures, and [[Opportunity|opportunities]] were presented [[An ideal for living|during Summer that year]] to [[An ideal for living#Despise Folly|reconcile the sword scholars]] with the nation and the Empire. 
Both the [[Wisdom]] [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|assembly]] [[Mandate]] and the Urizen [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|assembly]] mandate were enacted, and the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] [[Commission|commissioned]] the [[Construct Temple of the Winds|reconstruction]] of the [[Envoy to the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden#Temple of the Four Winds|Temple of the Winds]] in [[Morrow]] to serve as a central [[Spire#Temple|temple]] for the movement. While some people may have been skeptical of the reconciliation, the [[Benevolence, inspiration, and legacy|Severein encyclical]] [[An ideal for living#All Knowledge is Incomplete|muffled any dissent]].
Preparations to rebuild the ancient temple were interrupted by the [[Druj]] [[382YE Autumn Equinox winds of war#Lost in the Echo .28Morrow.29|invasion of Morrow]]. When the barbarian orcs attacked the construction site, nearly two-thirds of the sword scholars were slaughtered. It took almost a year for the Empire to free the area from Druj control and complete the work to restore the temple.
## The Wise Test
Meanwhile the progression of the [[Grey Pilgrim|Grey Pilgrims]] across the Empire had [[The long march#Heresy and Idolatry|caused concern in almost all the Imperial nations]]. During the Summer Solstice, the Urizen Assembly encouraged the sword scholars to [[383YE Spring Equinox Synod judgements#Judgement 84|engage in spirited debate]] with the Grey Pilgrims who had begun questioning spiritual attitudes in the Imperial nations. This led, in Summer, to a mandate [[Walk on#Urizen|declaring the study of Sulemaine to be acceptable]] which the [[383YE Summer Solstice Synod judgements#Judgement 73|general assembly upheld]] despite some dissent.
With construction of the Temple finally completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 383YE, the sword scholars had a focal point around which to rebuild their philosophy. The Urizen Assembly appointed the first [[Envoy to the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden]], whose responsibilities included liaising with the surviving sword scholar sects, and presenting their philosophy at Anvil and to the Urizen people as a whole. 
Once the work on the Temple was complete, the mandate that the Wisdom assembly had previously passed came into effect, though their full force would not be felt until the Autumn Equinox. This mandate encouraged ''all'' the virtuous to take inspiration from [[Sulemaine]] and the sword scholars. In particular, they were urged to actively challenge anyone who wishes to spread the imperatives of the Synod to justify their actions with reason and logic, effectively opposing the mandates of the Imperial Synod at every turn. As a result, it became much more difficult for the Synod to enact its will. At the same time, the Urizen Assembly judgement calling on the sword scholars to organise at home meant that, even in the absence of the Wisdom Assembly mandate, Urizen would still be resistant to Synod mandates.
During the Autumn Equinox 383YE, there was [[Mercy is weakness|spirited debate]] about the role of the sword scholars. The Urizen Assembly continued to support the sword scholars unequivocally, [[Mercy is weakness#The Soul Is A Blade|enacting a mandate]] to declare that "''the Paragon of Blades is the perfect epitome of the Urizeni spirit - pure calculating reason unhindered by emotion or pity.' The mandate caused a surge of support for the sword scholars, creating an opportunity to build fortified temples in Morrow (and the other Urizen territories should they be recaptured). It also meant that the power of the Synod over Urizeni citizens was further attenuated. Only in Redoubt was there any real resistance to the rise of the sword scholars; the presence of so many [[Sentinel|sentinels]] there made the idea of large gatherings of [[Sulemaine]]'s scions unpalatable.
The Virtuous apply what they have learned: the Sword Scholars undermine this with their ruthless and indiscriminate opposition to the expressed will of the Synod. Their founder, [[Sulemaine]] i Taziel, taught them to browbeat, silence, and murder any who raised a dissenting voice. They would rather strike down a soul seeking the right question than face an unwelcome truth. We should stand against such narrow minded and dogmatic behaviour. Those of scholarly inclination should look to the Exemplars Kala Windward and Avigliana di Sarvos, not to Sulemaine i Taziel. Above all, we should not let the will of the Synod be stymied by followers of a lawless sect whose philosophy promotes silence, shame, and inaction.
Debate is necessary and laudable, but obstructing the Synod's capacity to act and guide our citizens on the Way is not. If the sword scholars truly wish to improve and influence the quality of Imperial thinking let them do so by participating in the business and processes of the Imperial Synod, not by obstructing its ability to act.
## Chastise Folly
Unsurprisingly the Synod has not welcomed this challenge to its power. Autumn 383YE saw two significant statements of principle raised and upheld with greater majorities that rebuked the sword scholars for their beliefs and practices. The General Assembly [[383YE Autumn Equinox Synod judgements#Judgement 4|agreed with Rafael Barossa di Tassato]], who described the sword scholars in incendiary terms as "''followers of a lawless sect whose philosophy promotes silence, shame, and inaction''" and said Sulemaine i Taziel "''taught them to browbeat, silence, and murder any who raised a dissenting voice. They would rather strike down a soul seeking the right question than face an unwelcome truth''". He called for the virtuous to "''stand against such narrow minded and dogmatic behaviour''"
Clarice Novarion (the [[Cardinal of Courage]]) led the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]] who agreed that "''debate is necessary and laudable''" but made clear that "''obstructing the Synod's capacity to act and guide our citizens on the Way is not''." They - and the unanimous Assembly of the Nine - said that "''if the sword scholars truly wish to improve and influence the quality of Imperial thinking let them do so by participating in the business and processes of the Imperial Synod, not by obstructing its ability to act''."
At the same time several statements were upheld by the Urizen National Assembly. Clytemnestra of the House of the Wanderer [[383YE Autumn Equinox Synod judgements#Judgement 57|encouraged]] "''all sword scholars to act within Imperial law in the prosecution of their virtuous challenges''" and said that "''with our increased responsibilities comes increased obligation to virtue''." A further statement by Cato Hypation which said that "''the title "Paragon of Blades" is exactly that, a title. The Synod does not currently recognise Sulemaine i Taziel as a paragon of virtue. The Urizen assembly do not contest this''" was upheld, but did not receive a [[Greater majority]] - while the mandate [[383YE Autumn Equinox Synod judgements#Judgement 100|declaring the Paragon of Blades to be the epitome of the Urizen spirit]] absolutely did.
After the Autumn Equinox, [[383YE Winter Solstice winds of fortune#Mandates|several mandates that might otherwise have been enacted, failed]]. This failure was categorically due to the opposition of the sword scholars in Urizen, and the dedicated of Wisdom all over the Empire who now looked to them as an inspiration.
At the Winter Solstice, [[The price of wisdom|several mandates were proposed]] that would allow the General Assembly, the Wisdom Assembly, and the Urizen Assembly opportunities to further explore the situation with mandates, and the relationship between Wisdom, sword scholars, and the Imperial Synod.
