### Reign: 103 YE - 120 YE
### Called: The Builder
### Early Life and Election
Born and raised in [[Highguard]], the girl who would become [[Empress Aenea]] was a student of architecture, who helped build and design everything from mausoleums to castles.
### Reign
Aenea's attention was heavily focussed on the systems and apparatus of [[The Empire|the Empire]], with modifications to the roads, the infrastructure of the Civil Service, the organisation of [[The Bourse|the Bourse]], and the [[Imperial Senate]] and [[Imperial Law]] in search of refinement. She largely ignored the [[Imperial Synod]], which continued to exercise its political powers in pursuit of the spiritual well-being of [[The Empire|the Empire]] - only when the priests interfered with Aenea's projects for expanding and consolidating the infrastructure did she pay much attention to them. 
She was also responsible for building the Lyceum in the [[Bay of Catazar]] east of Siroc, and establishing the position of the [[Dean of the Lyceum]] to help the [[Imperial Conclave]] perform magical research in the service of [[The Empire|the Empire]], free of political control. When asked why she did not have the Lyceum built in [[Urizen]], she is reported to have simply shrugged and said "''The [[Urizen]] sometimes need to be reminded that while they may consider themselves foremost among the magicians of [[The Empire|the Empire]], their peers elsewhere do not think that considering something is the same as proving it.''" She refused to answer other questions, but was very careful to underline that while the Lyceum had been built in the sea near [[Freeborn]] territories it was to be overseen by the [[Imperial Conclave]] and not the [[Senator]] of [[Madruga]]. 
Historians point to this (among other incidents) as a foremost example of her abrasive personality; according to her contemporaries she lacked many social graces. Her brilliance lay in her ability to identify problems and find practical resolutions to them. She saw it as her role to build, reinforce and strengthen [[The Empire|the Empire]] with the same direct and pragmatic approach she might take to building, reinforcing and strengthening a castle wall.
One of Aenea's failings was that she left foreign affairs, including military matters, entirely to [[The Senate|the Senate]] and the [[Military Council]] without oversight; she was interested only in the Empire itself.
The Senators and the Generals took this as an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to expand the borders of the Empire, and their perceived aggression disquieted nearby [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]]. Several border wars occurred during Aenea's [[Tenure|tenure]] on [[The Throne|the Throne]], and at various points the Empire was at [[War|war]] with [[Faraden]], the [[Iron Confederacy]], [[Axos]] and [[Skoura]].
In 118 YE, the [[Sumaah Republic]] officially broke with the [[Imperial Synod]] and technically excommunicated not only [[The Empress|the Empress]] but all the priests of the Empire. Historians to this [[Day|day]] disagree as to whether the Empress might have been able to head-off this international incident had she been more interested in foreign policy; several scholars point to key points at which the intervention of the Empress might have defused the increasingly tense situation.
The Empire was technically at [[War|war]] with the [[Sumaah Republic]] for the next two hundred years, but the vast distances involved meant that military conflict was all but impossible, All trade between the Republic and the Empire ceased, however, and it was not until 326 YE that the trade-routes were re-opened.
### Death and [[Legacy]]
Aenea died. She was interred in a beautiful [[White granite|white granite]] mausoleum near the centre of the modern [[Necropolis]]. Built to her own specifications, it stands at the centre of a large marble plaza. As befits a woman whose primary interests were in stone and construction, the plaza is scattered with statues relating to the virtues, and various memorials. Its central location means that it commonly serves today as a popular meeting place for visitors to the [[Necropolis]].
Parallels are occasionally drawn with the later [[Emperor Nicovar]], but as the historian [[Senator]] Luca de [[Tassato]] said "''A ruthless attention to detail is not the same as being obsessed with details.''"
After her death [[The Throne|the Throne]] remained empty until the ascension of [[Empress Varkula]] in 125YE. During this time, the [[Senate]] became increasingly fractious and factionalised, creating the environment that allowed the ruthless Varushkan to seize power.
"By enabling free education in the magical arts, access to the title of [[Conclave]] [[Mage]] has also become free. Being free it has lost value, and it is important to the wellbeing of this Empire that [[The Conclave|the Conclave]] be comprised of mages who know the value of the work they do."
