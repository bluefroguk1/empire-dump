This page is about historical Imperial favours. For the power of the Throne, see [[The Throne#Imperial Favour|here]].
## Overview
The [[The Throne#Imperial Favour|Imperial Favour]] is a potent power of [[The Throne]], allowing them to temporarily grant some of their power to representatives. There are numerous restrictions on how the favour can be wielded, but in theory any [[The Throne#Powers|power of the Throne]] with the exception of the ability to create an [[Imperial Favour]], can be granted to a favoured lieutenant. As the Throne is one of the handful of [[Imperial Title|Imperial titles]] unable to appoint a [[Proxy]], this useful capability allows their power to be wielded in their absence.
One interesting twist on an [[Imperial Favour]] is they do not automatically expire. Favours granted by previous Thrones as far back as the foundation of the Empire still have legal weight - as was demonstrated only a handful of years ago when the [[Imperial Orcs]] used the favour of [[Empress Britta]] that granted the power of [[The Throne#Ratification|ratification]] during the transfer of [[Skarsind]] from [[Wintermark]] to its new residents.
Scholarship
Much of the information presented here was put together by the [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] scribe Madrigal i Temelan i [[Erigo]], who engaged in extensive study of the history of the [[Imperial Favour|Imperial favour]] for one of the Freeborn Senators (he declined to specify which senator) during the Autumn of 376YE. He submitted his short essay to the Green Library in [[Madruga#Siroc|Siroc]], although a revised copy was found among his personal papers after his tragic death three years later - apparently at the hands of agents of the [[Whisper Gallery]]. This version included some additional notes for what might have been intended to be an updated list of favours; these extra notes have been made public after their citations checked by the Imperial Archivist
Madrigal himself made some wild claims of a “conspiracy” to conceal information about Imperial favours created by earlier Thrones, but provided no actual evidence beyond what he described as “suspiciously missing volumes.”
An additional source available to Imperial scholars is a piece of [[Historical research]] commissioned during the Winter of 378YE by then-[[Minister of Historical Research|Minister]] Ioseph of Phoenix Reach, which provides some insight into Britta's use of the Favour.
## [[Empress Britta]]
As Throne, [[Empress Britta]] of course made use of the Imperial Favour. Having seen the mistakes of the previous three incumbents ([[Emperor Walter|Walter]], [[Empress Giselle|Giselle]], and [[Emperor Hugh|Hugh]]), [[Empress Britta]] vowed openly not to repeat them. She had the courage to speak her mind, but she tempered this with the wisdom to select competent advisors, and give those advisors the freedom to act on behalf of the Empire. While her primary focus for much of her reign was on the defence of the Empire's borders, and on liberating those territories lost to the barbarian, her representatives focused on bringing the [[Imperial Synod|Synod]], [[Imperial Senate|Senate]], and [[Imperial Conclave|Conclave]] back to the service of the Empire.
The most common use of her favour during this time was to give one of her staunch supporters Maxwell Heshel di Temeschwar the [[The Throne#Power of Veto|power of Veto]]. He employed this favour on three occasions in 374YE and 375YE to block attempts by Senators of the “old guard” from enacting self-serving or unpopular policies while the Throne was busy elsewhere. She also made careful use of favour in the military council - granting the [[The Throne#Defender of the Empire|Defender of the Empire]] to an ally, she could ensure that a disruptive or recalcitrant [[General]] could be replaced before they could cause any damage to the ongoing campaign without having to take the generalship herself.
Britta's final officially recorded favour was used at the Autumn Equinox when Maxwell di Temeschwar [[The Throne#Exclusion from the Senate|excluded]] the [[Senator]] for [[Zenith]] for the duration of a vote regarding the emergency resupply of the [[Varushka military concerns#The Army of the Golden Axe|Golden Axe]]. The charismatic senator had repeatedly derailed discussions of resupply to demand a review of spending on the armies given projected costs in mithril and weirwood of continued “total warfare.”
On the evening before the fateful conjunction that ushered in the State of Emergency of 377YE, the Empress summoned Magistrate Stanislav Karkovich to a private meeting where it was widely believed that [[Empress Britta]] created a final Imperial Favour, possibly as insurance against the disaster that all too tragically came to pass. The only person in attendance apart from the Empress and the Magistrate was the Navarr messenger Garrack White-Walker who unfortunately died during the disastrous conjunction the next day while delivering the general order to retreat back through the Sentinel Gate. 
Magistrate Karkovich refused to discuss what happened during that meeting, merely confirming that he was summoned in his “professional capacity.” The general consensus was that he was there to witness and record the creation of an Imperial Favour so that when it was finally used its provenance would be clear.
The favour remained a mystery until Autumn 379YE when it was used to ratify the motion to [[Relinquish Skarsind]] - this was before the Senate power of [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Relinquishment|relinquishment]] had been [[Create Senate power of relinquishment II|created]] of course. The precise details surrounding the discovery of the favour are unclear, although several scholars believe that the [[Egregores|egregore]] of the Imperial Orcs may have had it all along. Regardless. the [[Imperial Orcs]] claimed their new homeland, and it appears that the last of Empress Britta's favours has been resolved.
## [[Emperor Walter]]
[[Emperor Walter]] made extensive use of the Imperial Favour to empower his agents to operate in the Senate - in particular his brother Edward would regularly employ the [[The Throne#The Hand of the Chancellor|Hand of the Chancellor]] on behalf of the notoriously Senate-averse throne. He barely used the favour for anything else. It was generally assumed that his final favour (used to acquire money from the treasury for use in [[Imperial Bourse]] bids as usual) represented the last such effort - after all, he was not expecting to die and presumably had made no plans for his posterity.
Despite this, however, rumours have surfaced from time to time that Walter did in fact prepare a secret Imperial Favour - either just before his death or perhaps even earlier but dated to be usable only after a certain point - which he used as surety on a loan. The civil service will neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a favour of course.
## [[Emperor Hugh]]
There is a rumour that [[Emperor Hugh]] issued a favour in secret on the morning before his death, but it is generally held that doing so would have been out of character for an Emperor so invested in his personal charisma. That said, the common view is that Hugh knew he was going to his death so it is not impossible he made some preparations in that regard. The general consensus is that the favour would most likely have been the [[The Throne#Defender of the Empire|Defender of the Empire]]. The chief magistrate during Hugh's reign is deceased, but the civil service undoubtedly have records of any favour that remains outstanding.
## [[Empress Giselle]]
[[Empress Giselle|Giselle]] was one of the more profligate users of the Imperial Favour, granting it freely to her allies to act not only on her behalf but in pursuit of their own ambitions. There are extensive records of favours offered and spent throughout her reign, sometimes more than one during the course of a single Anvil summit. Often. Such favours involved the [[The Throne#Powers of State|Powers of State]] - especially the [[The Throne#Power of Veto|Veto]] and power of [[The Throne#Power of Exclusion|Exclusion]] – and they were invariably given to her supporters in [[The League]]. 
There are civil service records of a final unspent favour bestowed on Edward Cavaliero de Tassato, a [[Naga]] [[The League lineage and species attitudes#Reckoners|Reckoner]]. By all accounts, it did not remain in his hands long and was extensively traded back and forth within the League for several years after [[Empress Giselle]]'s death. Its precise nature is unclear, although there is a widespread belief that it allowed the bearer to raise a [[Senate motion|motion in the Senate]]. This is of course impossible – the ability to raise a motion is not a power of the Throne - and further investigation has traced the notion back to a little-known intrigue-romance story called ''The Empress and the Serpent'' published by an anonymous writer in [[Tassato]] in 362YE. The lurid story is quite clearly a work of fiction.
## [[Emperor Ahraz]]
There is some tenuous evidence that [[Emperor Ahraz]] prepared an Imperial Favour on his death-bed, and gave it to one of the older [[Imperial Orcs]], as sign of his good intent. The scholar Madrigal i Temelan i [[Erigo]], who uncovered the limited details of this favour, believed it granted the ability to take control of an Imperial army, with the intention that it be used to help the orcs conquer a territory of their own.
## [[Empress Deanne]]
As befits a Throne who prided herself on leading with a gentle touch, [[Empress Deanne]] is not known to have made much use of the Imperial Favour. She primarily bestowed those favours that allowed an individual to observe or participate in a house of power - [[The Throne#Member of the Senate|Member of the Senate]], [[The Throne#Member of the Military Council|Member of the Military Council]], and very rarely [[The Throne#Order of The Throne|Order of the Throne]]. There are no records of a favour persisting after her death, but if such a thing did exist it is likely to be along the same lines.
## [[Emperor James]]
Likewise, [[Emperor James]] is recorded as specifically issuing a favour to someone giving them the power to replace a general – though reports as to who and why are virtually nonexistent. There is some circumstantial evidence that this favour was actually used during the [[Imperial history#.28281 YE - 300 YE.29 The Second Interregnum|Second Interregnum]], shortly before [[Empress Deanne]] came to the Throne, to provide additional defence for the [[Highguard|Highborn]] territory of [[Necropolis]] against [[Grendel]] raiders. Sadly, records from the [[Imperial Military Council|Military Council]] can be patchy at best and it is difficult for a scholar to confirm this one way or another.
## [[Empress Brannan]]
According to historical records [[Empress Brannan]] issued an Imperial favour shortly before she lost the Throne. The favour was written and given to her advisor Helvennan Stormcrow of [[Wintermark]] – but there is no record of him ever using it. He disappeared during a particularly fierce blizzard in the Winter of 263YE while travelling between far-flung halls in [[Sermersuaq]]. While the location of the favour is unknown, its power is well documented - it granted the power to [[The Throne#Master of Magic|dissolve the Conclave]].
The prominent Highborn legal scholar, Arimeus of the Black Tower, argued passionately after the Empress' death that her favour ought to be regarded as defunct. He claimed it was legally invalidated by the same revocation that removed the Empress from the Throne. The arguments were never settled by the magistrates since the favour was never produced, but the abiding opinion was that the scholar's arguments were unlikely to sway the Constitutional Court.
## [[Emperor Guntherm]]
Historians record that [[Emperor Guntherm]] made use of the Imperial Favour in a familiar pattern; using lieutenants to influence matters in the Senate, Conclave, and Synod when he was elsewhere. In the years since the loss of [[Sermersuaq#Silver Peaks|Silver Peaks]] to the [[Thule]] there has been a persistent rumour that somewhere there is a final favour, created by Guntherm, that allows the bearer to [[The Throne#Declaration of War|Declare War]], intended to be used in the event that the Senate became too cowardly to act against obvious enemies of the Empire. It is likely, however, that this is merely wishful thinking among members of the anti-Thule faction in Wintermark.
## [[Empress Mariika]]
The cunning [[Empress Mariika]] made only limited use of the Imperial Favour by all accounts. She certainly left a final favour behind; a favour of Ratification that is recorded as having been used in the Senate during the second interregnum.
## [[Emperor Nicovar]]
As his obsession with managing every detail of the Empire increased, so too did [[Emperor Nicovar]]'s use of the Imperial Favour. His agents were prominently involved in the Senate, Synod, and Conclave, and regularly used his Favour to ensure the outcome the Emperor desired. He obviously did not prepare a final Imperial Favour as a legacy, but there are stories that the last favour he issued - granting one of his allies in the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Vigilance Assembly]] the power to act as a [[The Throne#Member of the Assembly of Nine|Member of the Assembly of Nine]] was not used, and may still be in existence. Confirming such a thing is next to impossible however - historical records of Nicovar's reign were not spared the fire any more than any others were.
## [[Emperor Barabbas]]
The oldest favour for which reliable records exist is that of [[Emperor Barabbas]], the Mariner. He gave his last Imperial Favour to Warin i Kumal i [[Riqueza]] of [[Madruga]], apparently with the intent of allowing the Freeborn shipbuilder to [[The Throne#The Hand of the Chancellor|claim the money]] needed to construct a small fleet of war ships. 
Most historians agree that Warin perished along with his Emperor when the [[Emperor Barabbas#The Invasion of Attar|Barabbine Fleet]] was lost. Before his death, however, Warin gave the favour to his nephew who survived the maritime disaster. There are unverified accounts that both [[Empress Mariika]] and the [[Shuttered Lantern]] [[Conclave order]] – along with several private individuals – were very interested indeed in tracking the favour down to either destroy it or use it to become rich.
## Older Favours
Records from pre-Imperial times are scant at best. It is not even entirely clear when the power to create an Imperial Favour was first created - it is possible that [[Emperor Giovanni]] or [[Empress Richilde]] may not even have had such a power. There is speculation, of course, but nothing that can be confirmed.
The sole exception comes from the generally-reliable journal of Hero of Reumah's Redoubt, writing during the reign of [[Empress Varkula]], who records that the [[Varushka|Varushkan]] Throne's predecessor, [[Empress Aenea]], created an Imperial favour in the last days of her reign allowing for the use of one of the [[The Throne#Powers of State|Powers of State]], most likely the Imperial veto. It seems unlikely the favour is still in existence after 250 years, but it is impossible to say for certain one way or another.
Beyond that minor note, nothing else reliable can be found.
