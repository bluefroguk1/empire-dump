## Overview
On the approach to the [[Spring]] Equinox, Imperial prognosticators have identified two potential [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to use a major conjunction to send large numbers of Imperial [[Heroes|heroes]] to [[Kahraman]] and [[Bregasland]]. Both [[Conjunctions|conjunctions]] take place on Saturday morning; the [[Imperial Military Council]] [[Will|will]] choose between then, and which nations [[Will|will]] be involved, during the [[Muster]] on Friday evening.
## Braydon's Jasse (Battle)
The squat crenelated towers, and sweeping walls of Fort Braydon have guarded the region since before the founding of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Its [[White granite|white granite]] edifice has long supported a garrison that quelled the raids of the [[Kahraman]] Hills orcs that dwelt in the northern hills. Whilst built to protect the miners of the rugged hills to the west, it also served as a defiant edifice that solidified the [[Freeborn]]'s claim on these lands. A proclamation from before the founding of [[The Empire|the Empire]] that humans sought to oust the Lasambrian orcs from the [[Territory|territory]]. The [[Jotun]] armies, the warbands of their [[Heroes|heroes]], and their human yegarra allies have dealt a hammer blow to the hearts of the defenders of [[Kahraman]]. The fortress, once a centre of bustling trade and garrison to passionate defenders, now belongs to the [[Jotun]], their banners adorning the walls.
The [[Jotun]] victory in [[Kahraman]] this season owes as much to the presence of the elite warbands of their [[Heroes|heroes]] as it does to their armies. These highly mobile units are able to operate like [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s military units, moving to support their armies on campaign wherever they are most needed. The [[Jotun]] have only a small number of them, around half a dozen as far as [[The Empire|the Empire]] can tell, but each is vastly bigger than the Imperial equivalent, ten or twenty times the size at least. Just like [[The Empire|the Empire]], these elite units can do more than just support an army, they are capable of carrying out daring raids when the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] presents itself. 
Three of these [[Bands|bands]] have sent their [[War|war]]-banners, escorted by a contingent of their warriors, to the valley of Morogvejo near the border of [[Kahraman]]. There's nothing special about this area that anyone can identify. The only item of note is the old ruined watchtower on top of Morogvejo hill. Centuries ago guards would keep watch over neighbouring [[Mournwold]], [[Tassato]], or [[Madruga]], to warn of any impending attack, but the tower is nothing but rubble these days.
The only [[Jotun]] of note who is actually here in person is Alok Surefoot, along with a large number of his fellow ghodi. But something is happening, the Jotun guard their [[War|war]] banners very carefully - they wouldn't have sent them here without reason. According to a captured yegarra, the ghodi are planning to cast their [[Runes|runes]] just before the height of the sun of the equinox. Once they have consulted the omens the warbands [[Will|will]] be given their orders for the coming season. 
The prognosticator's report of a major conjunction to the ''Morogvejo valley'' on the Saturday of the Equinox.
### Objective: Discover the reason for the Jotun's meeting
* Intercept one or more of the orders the ghodi have handed over to the [[Banner|banner]]-bearers
* The orders [[Will|will]] provide vital intelligence on what these warbands plan to do next
* Seize the ''Walrus Banner'', ''Standard of the Howling Bear'', and ''The [[Burning]] Oak'' banners
* The Jotun [[Will|will]] attempt to recover them in the future
By the time of the conjunction, the Jotun ghodi will have distributed three sets of orders, one to each of the three warbands. Eisa Winterborn, Yanya Uranduln, and Stephen of Sarcombe are not at Morgovejo, so the orders will be in the possession of the banner-bearers, as they are the most honoured member of each warband present. Imperial forces should look for Eisa's ''Walrus Banner'', Yanya's ''Howling Bear Banner'', and Stephen's ''[[Burning]] Oak Standard''. The Empire will have a short window to attack the forces gathered in the valley and attempt to intercept the orders before the warbands withdraw.
The Empire can also capture these standards from their bearers at the same time. Whilst the loss of the banners would have little impact on the Jotun's plans, they are important symbols of [[Worth|worth]] to the Jotun. If there were carried into battle by the Empire in future, then it is expected that the Jotun - or eat least their leaders - would make efforts to recover them; possibly going out of their way to do so, abandoning objectives or altering their own goals during an engagement to do so.
### Objective: Slay the Favoured of [[Hayaak]]
* Kill the ghodi, Alok Surefoot and capture the Spear of Bounty
* Stop the Jotun sending heralds to inflict damage on [[Imperial armies]] in the territory
* The Spear could be used to negotiate with the eternals of the [[Summer]] [[Realm]]
Alok Surefoot's legend has grown over the last year following a quest he undertook to recover the ''Spear of Bounty'', a relic of [[Hayaak]]. Since then, he was victorious at the battle at Jaelwif's Mound and called on a powerful boon of the Gryphon-King. That [[Ritual|ritual]] led to a hunt of vengeful heralds stalking the tundra of [[Sermersuaq]], and slaughtering many of the [[Thule]] Dragon's prized warlocks. The ghodi is currently protected by a band of fierce heralds of the [[Summer Realm]], hunters of the ''Prince-In-Exile'', and a sign of [[Hayaak]]'s favour. 
The Spear of Bounty is understood to have long held a place of [[Worth|worth]] within the ghodi who court the lieges of the Summer [[Realm]]. After he claimed the relic, Alok gained the Summer [[Eternal|eternal]]'s favour, which he used to strike against the [[Thule]] warlocks in [[Sermersuaq]]. Prognosticators believe that the ghodi plans to call on the power of the ''Hawk Lord'' again - only this time his target will be the Imperial armies in Kahraman. 
If this [[Opportunity|opportunity]] is not taken, or the Spear is not seized from Alok, then [[Hayaak]] will dispatch his heralds to hunt any Imperial forces present in Kahraman. Like all the Jotun, Alok hates the [[Navarr]] with a passion, considering them no better than human [[Druj]], so they will be his first target. Over the next year Imperial forces will suffer two hundred and fifty [[Casualties|casualties]] each season split between any [[Navarr]] armies present or any other Imperial armies present if there are no [[Navarr]] forces here. Obviously, if there are no Imperial armies of any nation present, then the heralds will not have anyone to hunt.
In addition, the Unicorn Prince has sent word that should the Empire be able to recover the Spear of Bounty, most of of the eternals of the Summer [[Realm]] would be eager to acquire it. The Dawnish enchanters, for example, could offer the Spear to any of the major Summer courts, [[Rhianos]], [[Meraud]], [[Adamant]], [[Cathan Canae]], [[Eleonaris]] or [[Jaheris]], in return for their patronage of the [[Eastern Sky]]. All of them have a reason to want to have a hold over the Gryphon-King.
## Graven's Rock (Battle)
Imperial forces have driven back the Jotun forces in [[Bregasland]], liberating the Grey and North Fens, The Rushes, and making gains into Ottermire. The [[Barbarians|barbarians]] are nothing if not resolute, they retreat steadily and in good order pulling back and regrouping close to the massive monolithic form of Graven Rock. The dank marshes have claimed Mathilda Fisher's dreams of Free Bregas. The households that had acknowledged her rule have thrown their doors open and welcomed the Empire as liberators.
But despite everything, the would be Queen of [[Bregasland]] refuses to surrender. With defeat inevitable, she is sending messages to everyone who will answer the call to gather at Graven Rock. It appears she intends to March west, just as the Marchers once marched out of [[Dawn]]. The difference, as she makes clear to her followers, is that she intends to be return.
Mathilda and her forces are gathering at Graven Rock. They are now they are beaten, but she is determined to make an orderly retreat. The [[Steward]] of [[Bregasland]] has hunkered down in the woods below Graven Rock, in ''Rock Foot Wood''; once home to a popular sheep cheese maker. Under [[The Oak|the oak]] and alder Mathilda is holding court, marshalling her most loyal followers to her, and along with her remaining Jotun allies, plotting their escape from [[Bregasland]]. They intended to retreat to [[Hordalant]] beaten but not broken. Some of the followers of Mathilda - the levies from the fens of [[Hordalant]], and those Bregas households who threw in their lot with the Fishers - were beginning to panic with disarray setting in among the bill blocks and [[Beater|beater]] troops. Fortunately Mathilda has some powerful [[Assistance|assistance]] in the form of Bushel Sykes who is there to bolster morale. 
The prognosticators report a conjunction that will allow the Empire to reach ''Rock Fort Wood'' in Graven Rock on the Saturday. The conjunction offers a small chance to defeat her, before she flees back to [[Hordalant]]. Her closest and staunchest fighters - mostly Fishers themselves - will remain in the woods, with the orcs and rebellious Marchers taking up the defence in the field.
### Objective: Execute Mathilda Fisher
* Mathilda Fisher will be on the field close to her Blue Eel Banner
* Execution by a Marcher will avoid Mathilda becoming a martyr
* An obvious show trial, and her public execution by a Marcher, will avoid Mathilda becoming a martyr
* As Mathilda Fisher is not an Imperial citizen this must happen on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]
* Dreams of a Free Bregas will die with Mathilda's execution
The Cousin's [[War]] was a tumultuous time in Marcher [[History|history]], and Mathilda has spun honey-dripped lies about how the wrong side won. To properly put this matter to rest, not only does she need to die, but it must be done good and proper. The kind of defeat that would convince any wayward Bregas that the Marchers really meant [[Business|business]]. 
If Mathilda escapes the field, or the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] is not taken then the Fishers will retreat to [[Hordalant]]. The Jotun armies are likely make a fighting withdrawl, giving ground in the face of any Imperial advance, but the Fishers and their allies will be long [[Gone|gone]]. They won't stay gone though, they'll resurface at some point in the future, like weevils in bad grain. It might take seasons, it might take years, but the Empire won't be rid of Mathilda Fisher until she's dead.
If she's killed but not executed - if she's cut down on the field, then her influence will live on. Those who believed in the idea of Free Bregas will start to paint her death as a heroic final stand against whatever nations the Empire sends to confront her. That won't have any immediate effect, but the Empire knows from the recent experiences in [[Mournwold]] how dangerous it can be when resentment and rebellion take root in [[The Marches|the Marches]]. Support for Free Bregas could become a rallying cry in the marshes any time something happens to upset those who live her. 
The Marcher [[Egregore|egregore]] has indicated that the best way to avoid the [[Steward|steward]] becoming seen as a heroic martyr for the rebel's cause, is to ensure that Mathilda has her head staved in by a true Marcher. It'll need to be a proper execution, she needs to be denounced for her crimes and then sentenced to death, so everyone can see her fate. Provided some Loyal Marcher takes responsibility for making that happen then it'll crush the uprising as dead as a rat under a millstone. There'll be no more talk of Free Bregas after that.
Mathilda Fisher will be on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] close to her Blue Eel banner. The banner has flown at the front of Mathilda's armies since her troops first entered the fens from [[Hordalant]] over a year ago. If the Empire can defeat Mathilda and capture the banner, it will make a fine trophy in the [[Military Council]] tent or perhaps decorating some Marcher encampment.
### Objective: Deal with Bushel Sykes
SOP|statement= Reckless violence and lack of [[Vigilance]] have led to disaster in Whittle and [[Mournwold]] before, lending credence to the poisonous words that Mathilda Fisher sows in Bregasland. Let us turn to the Vigilant path, and root out Fisher's falsehoods as we prove her wrong through our virtuous action to free Bregasland.|by=Edmund of Barrowby|vote=[[Greater majority|Greater Majority]] 121-0|when=[[Winter]] Solstice 384YE
* Bushel Sykes is a poacher Dedicated to [[Loyalty]] who is supporting Mathilda Fisher
* It is difficult to root out the traitors in Bregasland while Bushel Sykes remains active
* Excommunicating or executing the traitor on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] would allow the Marcher [[Assembly]] to root out any traitors from the Dour Fens
Bushel Sykes, a cantankerous personality from Ottermire, flew his true colours last season declaring for Mathilda and the Free Bregas clause. Wise in the ways of the dank fens he assisted the Jotun in widening the Odd Way, threatening the defences of Oddmire. Since then, along with his band of beaters, Old 'Shel has been [[Spreading the word|spreading the word]] of rebellion among the people of Bregas, seeding [[Loyalty|loyalty]] to the fens over the distant Empire. As the Jotun were pushed back over the campaign season, Bushel took to [[Anointing|anointing]] any who would listen, strengthening the weakening morale among the rebels and their Fisher allies with [[Auras of Loyalty|auras of Loyalty]]. If he hadn't taken this course of action, then the Fisher's strength could well have collapsed like a ill-pegged tent in a storm.
Under sight of Graven Rock, Sykes has formed a makeshift base from where he spreads news of Bregasland, and the whole Marchers, free from the rule of the Empire. In this consecrated area he has instilled a solid following to his cause, bolstering the morale of all around to the beat of a drum. When soldiers come to him he is asking them "What have you done for Free Bregas?". Reaching Sykes before he can exhaust his supply of [[Liao]] and strengthen the minds of the Free Bregas troops will aid in the battle, weakening enemy forces. As a priest of [[Loyalty]], Old 'Shel's survival is a threat to the liberation of Bregasland and the suppression of the Fisher's uprising. If he is left running around the fens, then there is still a chance he could create auras to cause trouble or keep the insurrection bubbling along, much like an Imperial priest enacting a [[Mandate|mandate]] might. Currently his presence is enough to stymie the Marcher [[Assembly|assembly]]'s attempts to root out Fisher's allies in the territory.
Excommunicating Sykes will put an end to his ability to use [[Liao|liao]] to rally support for Mathilda Fisher. It might mean he rots outside the Labyrinth, or that he comes back as a rat, but surely that's what the treacherous poaching bastard deserves, even if a [[Judgement|judgement]] hasn't been formally issued through [[The Synod|the Synod]]. Of course the Empire could just execute him, it won't send the same message, but it will also stop him opposing the Marcher [[Assembly]]. In either case then it will lead to a [[Mandate|mandate]] for the Marcher [[National Assembly]] next season to root out those who believed in the cause of Mathilda Fisher.
