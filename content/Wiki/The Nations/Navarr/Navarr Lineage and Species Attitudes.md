The [[Striding]] of the Clouded Eye exclusively travels the [[Trods]] of [[Therunin]] and boasts a purity of [[Merrow]] blood rarely found elsewhere.
## Overview
The [[Navarr]] are generally accepting of those with [[Lineage|lineage]]. Most communities have at least one or two individuals with the trace of [[Lineage|lineage]]. Because of the common bond that humans with the same lineage often feel and [[The Way|the way]] individuals move between Stridings and [[Steadings]], it is not uncommon for them to end up composed largely or solely of [[Navarr]] with a single lineage. There are rarely hard and fast rules however; such things are anathema to the adaptable Navarr.
## Briars
However, one lineage is distasteful to the Navarr. They mostly shun the briars, whom they canâ€™t help but see as an outward manifestation of the overabundant growth of [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] and as a reminder of what was lost. The prejudice may also be informed by the undeniable fact that briars make particularly dangerous husks when exposed to [[Vallorn|vallorn]] miasma. While intellectually many Navarr understand that a [[Briar|briar]] has their place in the Dance like everyone else, few are entirely comfortable in the presence of such a being, and they are rarely welcome among the Navarr. As a consequence, Navarr briars often make efforts to conceal their lineage as much as possible - which serves in its own way to reinforce the suspicion of their fellows.
