## Overview
War is not a game, it is a life-and-death conflict. Most [[Navarr]] warriors have little interest in forming battle lines and engaging their enemies in honourable battle. They are pragmatic, and favour war through ambush, skirmish and guile. They disdain heroic charges and single combat with enemy leaders - better to fade back and draw the enemy into a trap than face them in one-on-one combat.
The warriors of the [[Navarr]] have two primary areas of interest. They are concerned with the defence of the Steadings and Stridings against bandits and barbarians. They also take responsibility for fighting the forces of the [[Vallorn]]. The [[Vallorn]] represents a hostile environment, replete with dangerous plants and monstrous insects. These creatures make infrequent incursions into Imperial territory, and the [[Navarr]] are at the forefront of driving them back. They also prepare for the day when they will be able to assault their enemy directly, both by scouting the areas of [[Vallorn]] influence, and by locating areas that might serve as bases of operation, or recruiting allies to help in the inevitable challenge of defeating the [[Vallorn]]'s progeny. 
Donning warpaint – often embellished with a stylised [[Thorn|thorn]] motif – is an important pre-battle ritual and warrior bands work together to paint each other. By donning warpaint, the Navarr warriors display their commitment to the coming fight. Members of a [[Steading]] or [[Striding]] will often use similar themes, colours or designs to give themselves a clear battlefield identity as a unit, in the same way that other nations use livery or heraldry.
“You can’t betray your enemies.”
Leather and chain mail are favoured along with the ubiquitous barbed spear, which honours the original spears wielded by the Navarr forebears. Shields, when used, are narrow and fluted, barely wider than the wielder and often heavily decorated with the [[Thorn|thorn]] motif. 
## Thorns
Those Navarr who devote themselves specifically to war are called [[Thorn|Thorns]], who form a professional warrior caste of the Navarr. Like [[Brand|brands]], Thorns make an active decision to commit themselves to their chosen course; they literally swear to be ready at all times to fight in the defence of their community. They mark their oath, usually with a tattoo but many also choose to don warpaint each day. This ritual ensures that they remain focussed regardless of where they are. By marking themselves out in this way they make their identity and pledge clear and remind others that they are ready to fight. 
## Imperial Armies
The Navarr field three [[Imperial armies]]; the ''Black Thorns'', the ''Quiet Step'', and ''Isaella's Dance''.
### The Black Thorns
This [[Imperial army#Enlargement|large]] army is especially [[Army qualities#Fast|fast]] moving, able to cross great distances very quickly. They are especially adept at using the trods to move large numbers quickly, and have excellent logistical support as well as several covens of [[Navarr Magical Traditions#Vates|vates]] and apothecaries who help restore troops after forced marches. They have a knack, historically, of turning up just in time to help tip the outcome of a campaign.
The first Navarr General leads the [[Black Thorns]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer solstice each year.
### The Quiet Step
The army of the Quiet Step is loosely organised, allowing individual components a certain amount of leeway to operate as they see fit but benefiting from a central logistical core. They were once known for their experienced scouts capable of quickly gathering information about the enemy armies they encounter. They are equally adept at facing barbarian orcs, vallornspawn and [[Varushka|Varushkan]] monsters. Since the Winter Solstice 381YE, however, they refocused their purpose toward more aggressive tactics, employing [[Army qualities#Cunning|cunning]] strategies to confound and slaughter their foes. This shift in emphasis was effected with the assistance of the [[Eternal]] known as the [[Arhallogen|Spider King]] - heralds and creatures loyal to Arhallogen sometimes accompany or support the army.

### Isaella's Dance
The army of Isaella's Dance finished mustering just before the Summer Solstice 384YE. The army is able to use their mastery of Spring magic and their expertise with herbs to create powerful blade venoms to apply to their weapons. These poisons are designed to kill quickly and without suffering, ensuring that the enemy do not linger in pain. The [[Army qualities#Thornbound|thornbound]] army was founded following an [[Comes a time#Without Fear or Favour|opportunity]] presented by critics of the Spider King.

## Army Orders
The Navarr armies are the only ones who can benefit from the hidden [[Liathaven#The Paths of Lan Th.C3.BAven|Paths of Lan Thúven]] in [[Liathaven]] -  a magically shrouded route that passes through the heart of the [[Vallorn]] and allows them to treat the [[Territory#region|regions]] of [[Liathaven#West Ranging|West Ranging]] and [[Liathaven#Western Scout|Western Scout]] are adjacent to one another.
