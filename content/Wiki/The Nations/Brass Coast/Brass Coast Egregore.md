## Dust, Flame and Glass
The [[Egregore|egregore]] of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] was the first to be created and carries three names, Dust, Glass, or Flame - the three elements that the [[Freeborn]] believe shape their people. Which one it answers to at any given time depends on the mood of the host, the whims of the egregore, or the needs of the nation. A host may favour one of the three forms or change between them as mood and need arises. They can often be identified by the colour of their tagelmust.
* Dust dresses comfortably and luxuriantly and talks about the importance of [[Family|family]] and plain honest speaking, often presenting the aspect of.a [[Dhomiro]] or [[Corsair]]. Favours a sandy yellow tagelmust.
* Glass is a quiet philosopher, dressing practically, and likes to talk about the soul and what it means to be Freeborn. Glass occasionally takes on the mantle of the [[Kohan]] and favours a rich red tagelmust.
* Flame prefers the exuberant styling of a [[Sutannir]], encouraging parties and celebrations, and to inspire those going to [[War|war]]. Favours a blue or green tagelmust..
On bonding with the egregore spirit, a Freeborn citizen invariably puts aside their [[Family|family]] name, representing the fact that the entire nation is now their [[Family|family]]. Regardless of their names, the egregore is always fond of dancing, of sharing tales, and encouraging their people to live life to the full. 
## Current Hosts
### Mattias i [[Guerra]]
Mattias grew up in the region of [[Kahraman]], his [[Family|family]] specialising in paradors and wood working. He led a relatively sheltered life in comfortable wealth, until he visited [[Anvil]] and fell in love with the [[Adventure|adventure]] and heroics. He finds his natural [[Changeling]] temperament lends him well into [[Sutannir]] affairs, loving to organise a party, dance, provide hospitality and to listen to peopleâ€™s struggles with Virtue. Most often presenting as Flame, he embodies all that is passionate and tempestuous about the Coast, enjoying a fiery debate as much as a song. He is also known to commonly appear in his Dust form as a [[Scrivener]], taking great delight in weaving words into contracts.
