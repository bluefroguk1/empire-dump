[[The Brass Coast]] is wealthy in vineyards and orchards that produce fortified wines and flowers from which they make rich dyes. The people enjoy strong trade links with [[Foreign Nations]], allowing them to bring luxuries and commodities to all the people of [[The Empire]] (for a price of course!). Textiles, wines and ales from far-off places are prized treasures, but wood is a thing of beauty to the natives of the Coast. Theirs are lands of rolling plains, and fertile lowlands with lush vineyards. Although there are orchards of exotic fruit trees the land is devoid of large areas of Forest. Early in the history of the Coast they cut down most of their hardwood to build ships and settlements, and the fruit trees that remain are more suited for [[Burning]] than building. Since fine quality wood is a valuable commodity, dwellings tend to be piled high with rugs, cushions and furs.
The towns of the Coast are sprawling, disorganised affairs almost inevitably built around a bustling bazaar. Everything from steel to spices changes hands in these trading hubs and they are festooned with brightly coloured fabrics, gaudily [[Painted]] signs and exotic Wares. Contracts of trade, seals of [[Endorsement]], and bonds of marque are proudly displayed by vendors who hawk their goods to the people who fill the plazas and streets at all hours. In and around these cosmopolitan bazaars, the wealthiest families maintain sprawling estates. Often plain from the outside, Freeborn structures are alive with ostentation within and lined with ornate tapestries and finery. The most influential Freeborn thread their homes with running water and glittering fountains, sculptures and artefacts crafted from precious [[Materials]], beautiful rugs, carpets and hangings, the scents of incense and the sound of [[Music]]. It is important that a home be beautiful, as well as secure. “Your home,” as one ancient poet put it, “should be a comfort to your body, and a balm to your soul.”
