Following the liberation of [[Segura]] by Imperial troops in [[Spring]] 378YE, these resources were presented to the [[Military Council|Military council]] for assignment as [[Spoils of War]] during the [[Summer]] Solstice, 378YE following the assignenment of [[Segura]] to an Imperial nation.
### House of the Two Moons
[[Congregation]] / Rank 3
This great hall offers both spiritual instruction and banking services to the citizens of  Cerevado. It is named for the great silver disc that hangs at the eastern end of the hall called the ''Second Moon''. [[Folklore]] claims that it was cast from thousands of pre-Imperial silver coins (the [[Freeborn]] ''silver moon'') melted down when the new [[Currency]] was established in the reign of [[Emperor Giovanni]]. It is often aligned with the [[Assembly]] of [[Prosperity]], but also encourages the [[Ambition]] of both gamblers and ship captains who dare the dangerous rapids in pursuit of their goals. From time to time the [[Congregation|congregation]] has been forced to root out the cults of hope that spring up like weeds in the gamblers' paradise.
===The Golden Terraces=== 
[[Farm]] / Rank 5 
The Golden Terraces of Anozeseri are perhaps the oldest orange orchards in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. The farmers surrendered to the Naguerro army rather than see their orchards burnt to the ground; by doing so they were able to exploit the orcs unexpected taste for their fruit and preserve not only their lives but also centuries of careful cultivation. Oranges and other citrus fruit have been grown here for centuries - there have been humans here since the time of Terunael. The orchards are carefully tended, and there are several hybrid fruit grown here that are unique to the Golden Terraces.
### Ghita's Veils
[[Mana site|Mana Site]] / Rank 35
Ghita's Veils is described in more detail here.
### The Morning Swords
[[Military unit|Military Unit]] / Rank 3
When the orcs invaded from the Lasambrian hills, displaced farmers from Anozeseri took to the westernmost hills of Morajasse, and fought a guerilla [[War|war]] against the [[Barbarians|barbarians]]. They scavenged the old battlefields in southern Anozeseri for usable weapons and armour left over from the last [[Iron Confederacy]] invasion. When Anozeseri was [[Liberated|liberated]], these freedom fighters joined the triumphant [[Imperial armies]] in sweeping the Lasambrians out of their home. Many farmers returned to their homes, but some - having had a taste of the warrior-lifestyle - did not lay down their swords and sought a suitable captain to lead them against the enemies of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
===Kabalai Palace=== 
[[Business]] / Rank 5 (Diversified)
In the hills above Anduz is a beautiful white-granite palace, built in a complex fusion of [[Faraden]] and Freeborn styles and surrounded by extensive gardens. Its grounds contain many flowers and incense-bearing trees imported from the western hills, scattered with brightly coloured pavillions and gentle streams. Standing at one end of a trade route through the Lasambrian hills, this famous parador it is both the first Imperial structure seen by [[Traders|traders]] travelling from [[Faraden]], and the last seen by those leaving [[The Empire|the Empire]] for the windswept western hills.
Production: The Kubalai Palace is a rank five business that has been diversified once - it produces 12 crowns, 12 rings and two ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]] each season. Following the Summer solstice 381YE, Esteban i Ezmara i [[Erigo]] oversaw a significant expansion of the palace to take advantage of the influx of [[Faraden]] merchants involved with the [[Gloaming Road]].
### The Red Fields
[[Herb garden|Herb Garden]] / Rank 3
The Iron Plains have been a battlefield since before the Freeborn came to these lands; there is a saying that the fields are watered with blood more often than with rain. Established over three low barrow mounds from pre-Imperial times, the red fields are a series of [[Will|will]]-irrigated gardens surrounded by a [[Weirwood|weirwood]] palisade. The gardens produce quantities of especially fine [[Marrowort]], and the herbalists who tend them are often called on to tend wounds sustained during the exploration of old battlefields.
Production: The Red Fields produce 6 doses each of [[True Vervain|true vervain]] and [[Marrowort|marrowort]], and two each of [[Bladeroot|bladeroot]], [[Imperial Roseweald|imperial roseweald]] and [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]].
### Turunca Distillery
Business / Rank 2
[[Segura]] is known for its farmlands, most especially its vineyards and orchards. The Turunca distilliery has been taking oranges and grapes from across the [[Territory|territory]] and turning them into fine brandies and liqueurs for nearly three hundred years. It closed its doors in 366YE, but with the liberation of Anozel its extensive cellars and distillation halls have been re-opened. The distillers of Turunca are notoriously dismissive of the practice of turning grapes into wine - "''fancy fruit juice''" is a common term used in Sorbal for even the finest vintages.
===[[The Garden]] of Sighs=== 
[[Mana site|Mana Site]] / Rank 2
In south-eastern Anduzjasse, on top of a low hill, stands a garden surrounded by a low wall and littered with beautiful marble statues. The broad branches of the trees are hung with [[Mithril|mithril]] chimes. The wind that whispers through [[The Garden|the garden]] and sets the chimes dancing is said by some poets to be the breath of Hermana Suspirie, one of [[The Three Sisters|the three sisters]] - although the [[Hakima]] who traditionally gather the bounty of crystal mana from among the trees never agree as to which of the three mothers of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] Suspirie represents.
===Sunsong Ranch=== 
[[Farm]] / Rank 4
The Sunsong Ranch is a sprawling concern that covers many square miles of eastern Burnish between the tributaries of the Scorrero. Raided repeatedly by Lasambrians, the Freeborn stubbornly refused to give up their land or their herds of cattle, leading to numerous [[Battles|battles]] between orcish raiders and Freeborn defenders. The cattle breeders have carefully cultivated bloodlines of sheep, dodo, oxen and goats that can be traced back to the founding of [[Highguard]] and beyond. The ranch is famous for the succulence of its meat, fine cheeses and excellent wool and leather - and for the stubbornness of the people who work there.
