## Jack-of-the-Marches
Stories of Jack have been told since before the Marchers seceded from [[Dawn]]. Jack was said to appear when words or actions were needed to help common folk with the daily Challenges of a life born of hardship and graft. Jack was the [[Farm]] hand that appeared to help with a difficult harvest, the beater that arrived to assist with local disputes, the [[Landskeeper]] that came to lend their [[Wisdom]], or the Musician who lightened a burden with shared song.  A solitary but friendly figure who kept tender watch, revelled in games and lent their voice to a chorus.
With [[The Brass Coast]]  ritual 300 years back, Jack stepped out of [[Folklore]].

### Former Hosts
### Kit the Mummer
For a time Jack walked as Kit the Mummer. Kit traveled place to place, bringing news and gossip, plays (invariably Magical in nature) and songs and always plenty of tunes to tap your foot to!  There was nothing more important to her than keeping the customs and traditions of [[The Marches]] alive. This Jack was most at home in the thick of a crowd, whether in taverns, round the maypole on the village green or a town square.
Whether at a rowdy game of foot-the-ball, a jolly [[Wassail]] parade or a grim acknowledgement of the shortest days of Winter, she was there. The more people involved in the spectacle, the better. She had a particular fondness for maintaining Marcher Magical traditions, including its [[Hearth magic]], and was a friend and supporter of the landskeepers. 
### Robert of Ramsbruck
Jack as he walked until Autumn 379 was Robert of Ramsbruck. He claimed to have performed his duties for several generations, 75 years by his last count, although he's unsure when that started.  Seldom drawn on his life before he took up the mantle, he appeared as a Beater and performed the role of one. Convinced that “Nothing gets done sat down” he was fiercely stubborn once his mind was made up, but he never made a decision before drawing counsel from those he believed knowledgeable. Once his shoulders were set to a task no-one could tell him no. This Jack had little time for the politics of the senate or the guiding of the synod, but often sought the advice of Senators and priests, believing a quiet conversation by a fire side or bar table achieved just as much, and in considerably less time.
