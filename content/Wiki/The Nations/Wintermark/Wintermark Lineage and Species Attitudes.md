## Overview
The Winterfolk tend to judge people as individuals so they rarely discriminate against a particular Lineage, though they are unforgiving of people's failures. For Winterfolk to say that an individual “''cannot help themselves, it’s in their blood''” is meant as a final condemnation not as a mitigating justification.
## Specific Lineages
A spontaneous [[Changeling]] birth is regarded as a sign of good luck, and having “''sharp ears''” is a common compliment for anyone who shows alertness or initiative.
There are a number of groups of [[Kallavesi]] that are heavily dominated by those with the [[Naga]] lineage. Some of these naga-dominated halls disdain [[Magic]], preferring to focus on the arts of [[War]] and take a rapturous joy in battle which can disquiet even the militant [[Steinr]].
The bold, direct and uncompromising nature of the [[Briar]] lineage makes them welcome among many Winterfolk, especially those of the Steinr tradition. The bark-like material that covers their wounds is treated like any other scar and a briar with strong lineage is often given additional respect as a result.
## Orcs
In [[Wintermark]] most orcs are regarded as Worthy opponents, an enemy suitable to give or receive a good death from. They were also quick to accept the [[Imperial Orcs]] once they proved their [[Loyalty]]. Quietly some even comment that the Imperial Orcs have recently proved a more reliable and effective ally than some nations of [[The Empire]].
