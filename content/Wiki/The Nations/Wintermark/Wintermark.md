“The storm can never break us.”
Here is [[Wintermark]], where the frozen wind howls down from the [[Eternal]] storm of Sydanjaa to face a people stood shoulder to shoulder, holding steadfast against the cold. Revelling in battle, the indomitable Winterfolk stare down every threat with their heads unbowed, for they know that death is only the long sleep before the [[Dawn]]. Always Courageous, they commit themselves to every Challenge, matching wits and weapons against Worthy foes, forging victory from adversity on the [[Anvil]] of the north.
The Winterfolk are three great peoples - the wise [[Kallavesi]], the bold [[Steinr]] and the clever [[Suaq]] - wrought into a single mighty nation. Their banner flies the three rings joined together - three peoples bound with one breath, three voices raised together against the storm. Strength, [[Wisdom]], cunning, entwined together to form an unbreakable cord.
Wise [[Shamans]] untangle the skeins to peer into the future. The Thanes appoint banner bearers to lead the Warriors to battle. The Grimnirs, forbidden from battle by sacred oath, minister to the wounded. All the while, the stormcrows watch, keeping the people's [[Courage]] in place and ensuring that no oath goes unheard or unkept. At the end, the scops gather up the dead, raising them up in song and poem, so that their deeds will echo through the halls of the dead.
This can be a harsh land, but it does not breed harsh people. They hone their minds with riddles and mysteries and their souls sing with poetry. They craft beauty for the dreadful arts of [[War]], weaving [[Runes]] into every axe, shield and helmet. Their wise traditions of weregild and moot laid the foundations of [[The Empire]]'s law and governance. They are the beating heart of the Empire, and they know that if only the other nations followed their example, the Empire would rule the world.
