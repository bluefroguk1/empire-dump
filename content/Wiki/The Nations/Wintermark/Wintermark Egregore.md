### Sulkavaris
Sulkavaris, Knower of Names is the [[Egregore]] of [[Wintermark]]. It appears as a figure, male or female in form, dressed in the traditional garb of the Winterfolk either as [[Suaq]], Kallavasi or [[Steinr]] as suits its role. Sulkavaris particularly enjoys being told riddles or shown other examples of [[Wintermark]] art and [[Children|children]] are encouraged to create riddles of their own to tell.
In midwinter, Sulkavaris gives blessings to the virtuous but is sometimes accompanied by a malevolent figure known as the Krampus. The Krampus is a strange being that dispenses curses, but only upon those who ask for them. Individuals who feel the need to atone for something, perhaps an infidelity or a moment of cowardice in battle, [[Will|will]] approach the Krampus and whisper their crime in its ear. The Krampus curses them, but the [[Curse|curse]] lasts only until the next [[Winter|winter]] and those who survive the [[Curse|curse]] are absolved of any wrongdoing. An image of the Krampus is often worn as a symbol by the Frayed, although it has no particular affection for them.
### Current Hosts
In recent years it has taken four hosts - although each follows one of the traditions, their activities are not restricted to the Winterfolk who follow that tradition by any means.
