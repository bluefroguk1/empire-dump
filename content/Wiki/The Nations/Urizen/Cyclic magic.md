This page represents the now-defunct army quality of the [[Citadel Guard]], which has since been superseded by [[Highest discipline]] 
## Overview
This was the improved quality the [[Urizen]] [[Citadel Guard]] developed as a consequence of the [[Unmade trove]]. It cycled through five options over the course of five [[Events|events]], then came back to the start. Once set in motion, the cycle couldn't be interrupted and continued to run forever (in theory). The cycle was begun during the [[Winter]] Solstice 379YE, appropriately enough with the technique of the Bond of Tears.
The power originally cycled through all six [[Realms|realms]], but during the [[Autumn]] Equinox 382YE the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Sadogua]] "ate" the [[Night]] stage of the sequence as part of a boon offered to [[General]] Nicassia, permanently removing it from the sequence.
This quality incorporated all the benefits of the [[Magic|magic]] quality.
## Cyclic Resonance
The [[Ilium]]-infused [[Mage|mage]] armour and [[Mage|mage]] weapons empowered the [[Citadel Guard]] with additional [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to bring their [[Magic|magic]] to bear during a military campaign. This was an [[Enchantment|enchantment]] of their existing capabilities, and did not alter the ability to use the [[General]] as conduit for delivering [[Magic|magic]], nor their ability to gather crystal mana when undertaking arcane consolidation.
The energies tapped by the equipment from the [[Unmade trove|unmade trove]] shifted and changed in a predicable cycle, one familiar to any [[Mage|mage]] who has studied the [[Night magic|night magic]] [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Align the Celestial Net]]. Through this cycle, [[Day]] leads to Winter, Winter leads to [[Spring]], Spring leads to Night, Night leads to [[Summer]], Summer leads to Autumn, and Autumn leads to Day again returning the cycle to its starting point. There seemed to be nothing that can be done to impede, speed up, slow down, or interrupt the cycle once it had been set in motion, meaning that the [[General]] was required to think carefully about how best to employ the techniques the quality offered. 
In each case, the [[General]] used the power of the appropriate [[Realm|realm]] by issuing appropriate orders. Each technique allowed a unique attacking order to be employed. There was no requirement that one of these orders be used; the army could still use arcane consolidation or any of the basic [[Army orders|army orders]].
In some cases, these techniques exceeded what was achievable with ritual [[Magic|magic]] alone. This was primarily due to the skill and experience of the [[Combat|combat]] magicians and ritualists who accompanied the army. They did not represent a single incidence of [[Magic|magic]] use but rather the careful and synchronised use of many magical effects over an entire season.
A word of caution – no other army in the world possessed mastery of cyclic resonance. Unexpected interactions between the five techniques and the power of enchantments, curses, or even the actions of other armies, were a constant consideration.
## Benefits
The magicians and artisans of the [[Citadel Guard]] provided a constant benefit to the force, allowing it to help with the targetting of [[Rituals|rituals]] and to take the arcane consolidation order. In addition, the powerful benefits of [[Cyclic magic|cyclic magic]] meant that one additional technique was available to them each event. These techniques followed each other in strict rotation; each technique allowed the army the option of issuing a unique order that season.
### Magic
* [[Rituals]] that target a [[Territory]] may be performed using the [[General|general]] of the Citadal Guard as a focus
* Can use the ''Arcane Consolidation'' order when defending
The [[Citadel Guard]] contains many magicians, and soldiers trained to [[Fight|fight]] alongside magicians and help with the targeting of powerful [[Rituals|rituals]]. If they are defending a territory then they can provide a bounty of crystal mana to their general for use in creating helpful enchantments.
Arcane Consolidation
* The Citadel Guard generates mana crystals based on the number of victory points generated.
* Does not change army strength, [[Casualties|casualties]] inflicted or [[Casualties|casualties]] suffered.
The army concentrates on making magical preparations, shoring up their reserves of mana crystals and seeking out nearby sources of magic. A portion of this bounty in the form of mana crystals was passed to the army general so that they can make the most appropriate use of it.
Ritual targeting
The Citadel Guard contains many specialized magicians and magical experts. The general of the army can serve as a focus for any ritual that targets a territory, replacing the requirement for that ritual to be performed at a [[Regio]] in the target territory. This only works for [[Rituals|rituals]] targeting the territory where the army was currently on campaign. The general must be present throughout the ritual. Examples of [[Rituals|rituals]] that can be empowered in this way might include [[Frozen Citadel of Cathan Canae]] (although the target territory must still contain a suitable region), or a [[Curse]] such as [[Rivers Run Red]] or [[Naeve]]'s Twisting Blight.
### Technique of the Celestial Key
* Resonance of the [[Day Realm]]
* Preceded by: Autumn; Succeeded by: Winter
* Allows use of the Enlightened Scrying attacking order
Day resonates strongly with the symbols of divination and revelation. Even the merest apprentice beginning their journey to magical masters learns first how to divine the nature of magic before ever they touch it. There are few secrets hidden to the great masters of the Day [[Realm|realm]]. With this technique, binding the resonance of day to support the art of gathering and sorting information, the mages of the army can accumulate an awe-inspiring amount of intelligence in a short time.
Enlightened Scrying
*The army generates a map of the territory they are in.
*Casualties inflicted by this army are decreased by two fifths.
*The ability of this army to capture territory was decreased by a fifth.
This attacking order uses divination magic to discover extensive details about the territory within which the army was campaigning. In addition to the map of the territory, it provides details similar to those acquired by a [[Spy network|spy network]] including the location and size of [[Fortifications|fortifications]], details of regions, and the presence of any actively operated [[Bourse|bourse]] [[Resource|resource]]. 
### Technique of the Bond of Tears
* Resonance of the [[Winter Realm]]
* Preceded by: Day; Succeeded by: Spring
* Allows use of the Winter's Mantle attacking order.
Winter resonates with symbols of cruelty and survival. It preserves, but for all great powers of the [[Winter magic|winter magic]] there was a [[Cost|cost]] to be paid. At the same time that magic averts harm to the Citadel guard and allows them to press forward, their suffering falls on the allies of the army who take the injuries that might otherwise have crippled [[Urizen]] magicians. The technique was of limited value unless there was another allied army present to take any losses the Citadel Guard might otherwise suffer.
Winter's Mantle
* The ability of this army to conquer territory was increased by a fifth.
* If the army was fighting alongside any allied army, then all casualties received by this army are divided up between the other allied armies
Winter preserves, but not without a [[Cost|cost]]. With powerful enchantments, crippling injuries are averted – but must be suffered somewhere. The army can afford to press forward to victory, secure in the knowledge that for a short time at least any losses [[Will|will]] fall on their allies rather than themselves.
### Technique of the Transcendent Claw
* Resonance of the [[Spring Realm]]
* Preceded by: Winter; Succeeded by: Autumn
* Allows use of the Onrushing Storm attacking order.
Spring resonates with symbols of destructive energy unleashed, with both storms and natural erosion by plants and weather. By channelling this resonance, the walls of a [[Fortification|fortification]] can be overwhelmed either by a slow green tide or with devastating weather phenomenon.
Onrushing Storm
*The army must be attacking a region - that was in a territory that contains a named [[Fortification|fortification]] - or else the order defaults to cautious advance. The [[Fortification|fortification]] need not be in the region being attacked, and this order [[Will|will]] not cause it to be involved directly in the campaign.
*All casualties inflicted by this army are directed at the named [[Fortification|fortification]].
This order damages and potentially destroys a [[Fortification|fortification]]; it was especially powerful in that it can be used from a distance – the Citadel Guard do not need to engage the fortification and can indeed be involved in a campaign in an entirely different part of the territory.
### Technique of the Shadowed Threshold
This technique was removed by the [[Eternal]] [[Sadogua]] during the Autumn Equinox 382YE at the request of General Nicassia.
Walk Hidden Paths
* During this season, the army can move through one territory, regardless of whether it was in Imperial control, without stopping.
* If the army uses this ability to pass through a territory containing an enemy force then the ability of this army to capture territory was increased by one-fifth.
Any effect that would harm or impede travel through the chosen territory was greatly reduced in effect and may be nullified. This attacking order allows the army to move through a named territory as part of their normal movement while avoiding dangers such as enemy armies.-->
### Technique of the Mountainous Ascent
* Resonance of the [[Summer Realm]]
* Preceded by: Spring; Succeeded by: Autumn
* Allows the use of the Irresistible Spear attacking order.
Summer resonates with symbols of prowess and triumph. This technique allows the army to identify key strategic objectives, and helps to secure those objectives, allowing the army to quickly establish safe camps. At the same time, [[Summer magic|summer magic]] was used to infuse temporary fortifications to grant them extra strength, providing tactically significant locations which can serve as centres from which the army to expand outwards.
Irresistible Spear
* The army suffers no penalty to victory points generated to capture a region which was not adjacent to a controlled region in the same territory.
[[Summer magic]] strengthens and supports the army allowing it to swiftly establish a [[Beachhead|beachhead]] in a new territory, or to make an unexpected strike deep into enemy controlled areas.
### Technique of the Coiling Chain
* Resonance of the [[Autumn Realm]]
* Preceded by: Summer; Succeeded by: Day
* Allows use of the raise the glass labyrinth attacking order
Autumn resonates with symbols of travel, communication, and binding. Channelled and focused, magicians warp synchronicity and serendipity to interfere with the command structure of opposing armies, impeding their ability to coordinate. The lingering effects of the magic warp the ability of enemy soldiers to move away.
Raise the Glass Labyrinth
* Opposing armies or navies may only move one territory in the season following the one in which this order was taken.
This attacking order weaves [[Autumn magic|autumn magic]] around opposing armies, entangling them with a barrage of curses that interfere with [[The Chain|the chain]] of command in subtle ways. It also creates a cumulative warping of chance that makes it difficult for them to withdraw or advance.
