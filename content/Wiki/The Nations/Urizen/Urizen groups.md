## Overview
There are many [[Spires|spires]] in [[Urizen]], but only a comparative handful are involved in the affairs of [[The Empire|the Empire]] (that is, attend the seasonal summits at [[Anvil]]). The influence of a [[Spire|spire]] can wax and wane, and involvement in Imperial affairs is not always a reflection of their influence within the nation itself. This page presents in-character information about the spires that attend, or have attended, [[Anvil]] — the kind of thing that someone who asked about the [[Spire|spire]] might uncover from talking to their peers. In each case, the information is provided by the players and edited before being put on [[The wiki|the wiki]].
The majority of spires listed here represent player-character [[Groups|groups]]. You should not create a character who is part of a [[Spire|spire]], or has personal [[History|history]] with one, without first clearing it with the appropriate players. You should also check before including other players' spires in your [[Background|background]]. The [[Background|background]] team are unlikely to approve a background that significantly impacts or involves another player character [[Spire|spire]] without their permission. There are also a handful of prominent NPC spires included for completeness, but they are not intended for use by player [[Characters|characters]].
## Spires of [[Morrow]]
The spires of [[Morrow]] are some of the oldest in [[Urizen]].
### Temple of the Red Scroll Bearers
*Purpose: [[Sword scholar|Sword Scholar]] Temple
*Region: Peregro
*Apothegm: ''Interrogate the world with your blade and with your mind.''
*Master: Aspar
The exact details regarding the founding of the temple have long since been lost, burnt away by centuries of persecution by the sentinels of [[Urizen]], but the Temple and its adherents remain.
A [[Sect|sect]] of sword scholars often seen as decadent and libertine to those outside of the temple, the Red Scroll Bearers consider the experience of all sensations to be important in understanding the world - including those of pleasure and pain.
They believe that it is important to be knowledgeable about the myriad ways in which humanity can exist and how human experiences affect the nature of [[Wisdom]]. The Red Scroll Bearers walk this path of varied outlook, and through means of [[Magic|magic]], [[Anointing|anointing]] and alchemy they strive to gain a thorough understanding of the world through direct experience. Simply learning about something is not enough, you must test what you learn. 
Above all, the Red Scroll Bearers revere [[Sulemaine]] and her teachings, and strive to hone their martial and mental arête through duels and debates. They despise untruths and conjecture and believe that all things must be questioned. This of course leads to heated discussions, varied outlooks and fierce rivalries within the temple itself.
### Skylark [[Spire]]
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Operus
*Apothegm: ''Knowledge speaks, but [[Wisdom|wisdom]] listens.''
A very old spire dating from the origins of the [[Urizen]] nation, Skylark is an arcane spire that was created to place great emphasis on [[Day|day]] and [[Night magic|night magic]], thus creating a significant number of Seers, stargazers and Torchbearers throughout the ages. Due to the emphasis on divination [[Magic|magic]], its martial prowess is seen a lacklustre, requiring aid from nearby citadels throughout the years. However, due to the constant [[Cost|cost]] of repairs of the ancient structure of the spire, there has been an increasing appearance of Architects among the populace in recent years to help raise funds for the community.
There has been a significant tradition of this Spire accepting [[Merrow]] born Brass Coast orphans throughout the years, believing that more minds [[Will|will]] benefit the spire (and in turn [[Urizen]] as a whole) in the future.
This spire is known for the various eagles that inhabit the surrounding [[Landscape|landscape]] and its beautiful waterfall that has been constructed to fall through the different levels of the spire out into a small lake that the [[Merrow]] inhabitants use to meditate. 
### Temple of [[The Wanderer|the Wanderer]]
*Purpose: [[Sword scholar|Sword Scholar]] Temple
*Region: Caeli
*Apothegm: ''Greater knowledge equals greater precision. Find more locus points, gather more strings of influence and perfect your net of prediction.''
*[[Arbiter]]: Cato Hypation 
A secret temple dedicated to [[The Wanderer]] and to understanding the inexorable powers of Fate. The few privileged enough to be invited tell tales of a central chamber, home to a never-ending great tapestry which is carefully added to and edited daily.  
Rather than telling history the Scholars claim it is physical representation of the [[Net of the Heavens|net of the Heavens]] as the temple understand it.  
Though years of persecution are not easily forgotten, some adherents have chosen to come to [[Anvil]]. They are the inheritors of a vanishingly rare doctrine, and bring with them the question: how much of your life is truly governed by chaos and how much do you dare admit?  
## Spires of [[Redoubt]]
[[Redoubt]] is still a little wild; the spires here have a strong martial tradition.
### The Citadel of Stillwaters
*Purpose: Citadel
*Region: Siluri
*Apothegm: ''Stillwater leaves no ripples''
*[[Arbiter]]: Narses Stillwater
Originally coming from different spires all over Urizen, after the battle of Solen’s Doubt a group of veterans sought refuge in a small [[Ruin|ruin]] near the towering mountains in the Siluri hills. The natural [[Spring|spring]] from the lake aiding their meditation, the herons that hunt there inspiring their training and the gardens a source of comfort from the horrors they had witnessed. And so in rebuilding their new home, they rebuilt themselves. 
They began a program of cascade training in order to provide Urizen with constant supply of effective sentinels that embody all of the benefits of the old and new, comprising modern fundamentals with a unified philosophy, using this they contributed to current Urizeni theatres that they themselves could not attend due to their convalescence.
Due to the nature of the formation of the citadel, it’s members are more aware than most of the threats to their home, this shows itself in a more easy going nature to which some Urizeni are not accustomed. This nature only comes from knowing intimately that each breath could be their last and that they should live it fully.
With the citadel’s original reason for returning to [[Anvil]] (reconquering [[Zenith]]) resulting in a swift victory, they have now set their gaze on further conquerable shores on which to test their [[Ambition|ambition]].
### The Crystal Skies
*Purpose: Former Arcane Spire - now a Citadel
*Region: Tomari
*Apothegm: ''The ends do not justify the means.''
*[[Arbiter]]: Lanius of the Crystal Skies
The once arcane spire of [[Spiral]], now military encampment in [[Redoubt]], sits at the foot of [[The Mountain|the mountain]] that is the home to Netherwatch Spire. With most of the spire being sentinels, trained up from a young age, not by choice, but as a necessity, many of the sentinels that are experienced tend to be on the younger side. Even with all that has happened to their home in [[Spiral]], they always believe and push for a way to win, without sacrifice. Whether this is due to naivete or [[Courage|courage]], a nation built upon trying to be perfect, surely can find a way to win without compromise.
Even though most of the original spire still remains, most of its current members are refugees from other spires from [[Zenith]] and [[Spiral]]. As an encampment, the spire finds it easy to let people move in and stay till we can organise proper places for them in nearby spires. Many members of the group seen today are those that chose to stay in the encampment to help others that require it, and assist with the reclamation of fallen [[Territory|territory]], whether it be [[Zenith]], [[Spiral]], or another nation's home.
### Embers Wake
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Optarion
*Apothegm: ''Through travel, we gain Knowledge. Through knowledge, we gain [[Wisdom]]. Through [[Wisdom]], we enlighten the World.''
*[[Arbiter]]: Alexios of Ember’s Wake 
Carved into the towering walls of a narrow-mouthed bay amidst the mighty cliffs of Optarion, the heavily fortified Port-Spire of Ember’s Wake is a populous, outward looking spire with a focus on trade and the gathering of knowledge on a global scale. There are several tales which tell its founding, but the only certainty is that the core of the spire was built long before its current inhabitants arrived. Regular raids on the spire and its ships by the [[Grendel]] and various other pirates and vagabonds, as well as the beasts that prowl Optarion, has meant that every member of the spire has some modicum of martial training, even if this is not the focus of their [[Arete|arete]].
As an outward focussed spire seeking to expand and share knowledge within [[The Empire|the Empire]] and beyond, Ember’s Wake is notable for its eclectic mixture of aretes, its many torch bearers and a larger than average population of briars.
Though formally led by an [[Arbiter|arbiter]], the running of the spire falls to the Spire Council, a body of 7 individuals, which includes the arbiter, who oversee all aspects of the spire’s day-to-day operations.
In spite of its outward looking nature, members of the spire have only begun to attend [[Anvil]] since [[Winter]] 382YE, and live up to the spire’s reputation for an eclectic array of foci.
### The Lighthouse at Nikephoros
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Naris
*Apothegm: ''I [[Will|will]] be better.''
*Arbiter: Telemachus
The foundations of the Lighthouse at Nikephoros were laid before Urizen joined [[The Empire|the Empire]]. It was founded as a citadel from which Urizen mariners patrolled the coasts, pirating [[Barbarian|barbarian]] shipping and repulsing orc raids on the shipyards at Elos.
After joining [[The Empire|the Empire]] - and with its naval importance diminished following the creation of the first [[Imperial navy|imperial navy]] - centuries of slow decline began. The discovery of a potent Winter [[Regio|regio]] in a deep tidal cave beneath the spire changed the focus of the Lighthouse, and over generations it transitioned from a decaying citadel into a decaying spire. But within the stagnant heart of the spire the influence of the Winter ritualists grew, and the Circle of the Drowned was formed.
At a recent [[Coven|coven]] [[Symposium|symposium]] the Circle of the Drowned enacted a political coup, seizing leadership from the passive old guard in favour of the new.
Now dedicated overwhelmingly to [[Ambition]] the spire is ascendant. They embody the principles of the Wasteland strongly, holding close to their oaths and using any and all tools to achieve their ambitions. The Circle and the spire care more about [[Magic|magic]] as a tool to achieve their goals than as an end in itself, practising both [[Astronomancy|astronomancy]] and [[Blood magic|blood magic]]. When they gather at anvil they do so with a singular purpose, pushing for the reunification of Urizen and the defeat of its myriad foes. The [[Banner|banner]] Urizen, Whole was founded by the Lighthouse with a simple oath - ''"by my deeds, Urizen [[Will|will]] be restored"''.
### Netherwatch Spire
*Purpose: Spire
*Region: Delving
*Apothegm: ''Where this is darkness, Let us bring light.''
*Arbiters: Thalia and Galene
Melded into the mountains of [[Redoubt]] it overlooks, Netherwatch Spire was originally an arcane spire involved with mining and craftsmanship; like their neighbours in Delving. Supposedly the spire was built with the aid of the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Adamant]] though the true history of has long since been forgotten and the covens focus moved to Day and Spring over [[Summer]].
Now the spire boasts the twin pronged aretes of [[Wisdom]] and [[Prosperity]] with the co-arbiters Thalia, Convenor of the National Fund, and Galene, the [[Imperial Inquisitor]] and Convenor of the National [[Assembly]]. A large contingent of the Anvil Militia [[Calls|calls]] the spire their home, promoting their commitment to truth and Wisdom.
### Serpents Rest
*Purpose: Spire
*Region: Limus
*Apothegm: ''We bring the peaceful light, To the chaos of the dark ocean''
*Arbiter: Captain Marinus
The spire formed as a result of a dramatic rescue from sea for the lone survivor; Captain Neptune. When rescued he couldn’t tell anyone what had happened or how he survived, all he could say was that seen a “Great Serpent”. He and other captains decided to set up the Serpents Rest, named after the mysterious creature he saw, as a [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]] for those feeling lost or seeking safety. It wasn’t long before Serpents Rest became a spire dedicated to fleets and the sea. The spire itself was originally a docking area and warehouse in Cargo and in time some of the space was converted into private lodgings or expanded to accommodate guests.
Although the magically inclined members of Serpents Rest have no specific focus, they typically prefer the [[Realms|realms]] of Spring, [[Autumn]], and Day due to the [[Rituals|rituals]] in [[Imperial lore]] that can support fleets. 
### Temple of the Prismatic Eye
*Purpose: Temple
*Region: Ventosi
*Apothegm: ''To be the Eye that Seeks, ever Vigilant, scouring the darkness.''
The Temple of the Prismatic Eye sits in one of the deepest parts of the Ventosi Valley, away from the more lofty spires and surrounded by trees. Initially, the Temple was a waystation for ancient travellers but new roads and methods of transport have left the paths nearby unused, the perfect site for a hidden [[Sword scholar|sword scholar]] retreat. The Temple exists both to extol the beliefs of [[Sulemaine]] and to defend Urizen from threats within and without.
The primary goal is in keeping watch, with many of the members making expeditions to periodically cull the dangerous beasts and orcs that populate the lowlands and to watch for signs of heresy and sin amongst the people. They believe that it is through individual reflection, study and training that true believers achieve the greatest heights. They liken their individuality to light [[Streaming|streaming]] through a prism. Pure light is made from individual colours coming together in balance, a spectrum of experiences which let the individual excel among their peers.
Currently, the Temple’s goals remain set on returning Urizen’s lost territories and setting the people back onto a logical and individualistic path. They are also outspoken critics of the sentinels, who have failed in the defence of Urizen and turned their backs on its people, and of the [[Citadel Guard]], who they see to have been mismanaged, underutilised in aid of Urizeni interests.
## Spires of [[Spiral]]
Those spires still in Spiral must contend with both the presence of the [[Grendel]] and the malign force that squats at the centre of the territory.
### Academy of the Southern Shore
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Apulus
*Arbiter: Letho Southshore.
[[The Academy]] of the Southern Shore is a prominent teaching institution aimed towards young magicians of Urizen. Its students range in ages from the youngest [[Children|children]] to young imperial citizens, who spend time at [[The Academy|the Academy]] in order to refine their [[Arete|arete]]. The spire itself is built on the slopes overlooking Apulus. The spire has been known to take in refugees, sometimes those of other nations who arrive from the seas.
[[The Academy]] specialises in the [[Magic|magic]] of the [[Night]] [[Realm|realm]], though all [[Ritual|ritual]] arts are studied there. Teachers encourage students to pursue religious and martial [[Skills|skills]] if desired. [[The Academy|The academy]] is well known for an unusual pedagogy which emphases the use of the ritual Cast Off [[The Chain|the Chain]] of Memory. Through the use of this ritual the students and the teachers of [[The Academy|the Academy]] seek to remove “distracting” experiences that cause them to suffer a loss of poise or divert attention from their [[Arete]]. 
The spire has also become well-known, particularly within Anvil for its unconventional approach to the tradition of astromancy, notably calling on the [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Oak]] as The Palm. For this reason a Palm Tree has become a more identifiable symbol of the Spire (especially in Anvil) than the official Sigil. 
The Spire closed its public doors following the awakening of the [[Black Plateau]] and lost many of its students. In the wake of this tragedy members of the Spire first travelled to Anvil, since this fateful step the Academy has slowly been returning to strength.
### The Great Library of Ankarien
*Purpose: Arcane spire
*Region: Ankra
*Apothegm: ''The light of a single flame may [[Illuminate|illuminate]] a thousand steps along [[The Way|the way]]''
*Arbiter:  Maximillian Ankarien
Ankarien is one of the largest and most venerable spires in Spiral, with the date of its founding lost in pre-[[Imperial history]]. It is traditionally organised around its Great Library, which was once one of the most significant centres of learning and education in Urizen. It has long been politically active, sending delegates to the Grand Conclaves for as long as they have existed and eventually giving rise to [[Emperor Nicovar]] Ankarien. Unfortunately, Ankarien was one of Nicovar’s most prominent targets and suffered terrible destruction at his hands, its collections of books decimated.
After Nicovar’s fall, [[The Library|the Library]] dedicated itself to rebuilding, restoring some of its former [[Glory|glory]], but when the [[Grendel]] invasion of Spiral came, Ankarien found itself unprepared and the inhabitants fled with what volumes they could carry to Endsmeet while the sentinels bought time with their lives. Since then, Ankarien has been a prominent voice for the exiled spires of Spiral, pushing for the reclamation of the lost territory. After a brief spell leading the resettlement of the territory, they now find themselves in exile once again.
Ankarien is mostly focused on politics and learning, with a strong tradition of both magi and stargazers. It has a slightly unusual leadership structure, with the arbiter responsible for the internal affairs of the spire and a maester responsible for wider leadership. It sees itself as leading the reclamation of Spiral and this underpins its entire philosophy, along with a strong sense of its own history and tradition.
### Temple of the White Stork
*Purpose: Temple
*Region: Apulus
*Apothegm: ''There is no greater teacher than experience, no greater experience than the duel.''
*Arbiter: Calgacus Apulian
Originally a school of swordplay, the White Stork is defined by its members' odd ideals, viewing single [[Combat|combat]] as the ultimate expression of, and metaphor for, every aspect of a soul's Way. To engage another in such a manner is to both see and show the essence of those involved without guile or shame. This clear lens held appeal for some, though the Temple's brutal regime, disdain for convention, and anything it considered frivolous - as well as socially manipulative methods - made many more Urizeni wary. A small and elitist group nestled in the mountains of Apulus, just north of the ruins of Apulian, they suffered over this past decade, losing their holdings and retreating over some years to [[Morrow]]. Constant [[Battles|battles]] in defence of refugee caravans in their slow retreat filled their numbers with a curious and grateful mix of souls from across the nation as their laity, and the few surviving scholars continue to pass to them their ideal of a purely logical, perfectly poised [[Paragon|paragon]] of skill.
When this eclectic band of itinerants gathers at Anvil, they seem to focus on providing tuition and guidance to individuals from other nations, functioning as instructors, advisors and confidantes to many influential persons. Some say this allows them to influence others positively towards Urizen as well as identify those who threaten it. [[The Stork]] watches, and chooses when to strike.
### Sunshaper Citadel
*Purpose: Citadel
*Region: Ossuary
*Apothegm: ''The light of day still shines throughout the darkest nights.''
*Arbiter: Eridion Sunshaper
Built high upon the hills of the Ossuary region, Sunshaper Citadel stood as a point of safety for scholars seeking extended expeditions to the many buried bones of unknown origin in the region. With many smiths complementing the high [[Sentinel|sentinel]] populace befitting of a citadel, it held many amicable trade alliances with other nations, notably [[The League|the League]] in [[Sarvos]], trading arms for coin in the name of [[Prosperity]].
After the site of the Citadel was desolated by the [[Druj]], the inhabitants of Sunshaper Citadel have evacuated out of Spiral. Their objective is to gather support from across [[The Empire|the Empire]] for the reclamation of Spiral and rebuilding of the Urizeni infrastructure there. They seek to carry the message of [[Vigilance]] across the Empire, bolstering the resolve of others that have lost their way and hope to find a path back home. They endeavour to resolve disputes and miscommunications between those in Anvil, to provide a unified Imperial view towards objectives and quell infighting wherever possible. Thanks to Sunshaper's sundering, its members are currently found as advisors and martial aides to those across the nation, with intent to rally those they surround themselves with towards the citadel’s motives.
## Spires of [[Zenith]]
### Hope's Cultivar
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Proceris
*Apothegm: What we sow today shall be reaped tomorrow as a brighter future
*Arbiter: Valantinian Hope-Tender
The spire was founded in 384YE immediately after the expulsion of the [[Druj]] from [[Zenith]]. Hope's Cultivar is built from the ruins of a small citadel constructed right at the peak of a mountain in northern Proceris. Chosen for its high location and reservoir fed by fresh snow melt to try avoid the very worst of the region's poisons and curses.
The Spire attracts architects, herbalists and those whose [[Arete|arete]] lies in agriculture. Their goal is to play a part in the restoration of Zenith and apply the pillar of reason to the growing of plants. Five towers rise into the sky, each intended to try to maintain a different climate. Within the towers trials are run in an attempt to try to understand agriculture better.
### Lapis Heights
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Occursion
*Apothegm: Question what is known completely, to stop searching is to never know what was missed
*Arbiter: Juno of Lapis Heights
Nestled among the hills of Occursion, the Lapis Heights spire guards a humble yet proud history. Originally named for the mana crystal deposits at its base that drew in settlers with their rich blue colouring, it later became known for its production of high quality parchment. The lotus trees that thrive in the area create a durable, delicate paper which is much sought after. The art of papermaking survives, and it is traditional for members of the spire to give gifts and letters in the form of folded paper flowers and animals. 
Lapis Heights overlooks the lakes of Bountiful Autumn and benefits from its [[Magic|magic]] through its small collection of Autumn mages. This combined with its history of cultivating mana crystal and artisanship has steeped the spire in the [[Business|business]] of production and trade. Despite this display of [[Prosperity]], Lapis Heights does not lean heavily towards any one virtue, having been founded by philosophers of [[The Way|the Way]] among others. 
During the [[Druj]] invasion Lapis Heights suffered devastating losses and was considered lost or disbanded for a time. A group of survivors have begun the effort to return to and rebuild the spire, and are taking the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to reinvent its values. Calling back to their philosopher ancestors, the new Lapis Heights strives to discover new ways of experiencing Virtue and [[Hearth magic|hearth magic]], and support the exploration of experimental magics.
### Pioneer's Peak
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Proceris
*Apothegm: Together, we find everything we need.
*Arbiter: Isaac of Pioneer's Peak
Pioneer's Peak was founded during the Winter of 384YE, after the Imperial reclamation of Zenith from the [[Druj]], in an effort to build on the [[Legacy|legacy]] of the Arch of the Sky, after its loss.
This arcane spire is now home to those who pursue the understanding of magic and [[Astronomancy|astronomancy]] as the highest form of [[Arete|arete]]. They endeavour to study and use magic - primarily, but not exclusively, [[Autumn magic]] - to accomplish ideals of mutual aid, aiming for magic to be used for the improvement of the lives of all.
Those who study at Pioneer's Peak are mostly stargazers - with some mages or seers - who hold a mutual belief in the power of the collective. A pioneer stands on the shoulders of giants - likewise, the path to improvement (be it arete, virtue, or truth) is never walked alone, with the magic they study reflecting this. They are less interested in individual power or singular great acts, than they are in small actions, amplified and replicated by scope and time.
### Starsong
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Proceris
*Apothegm: To the songs that [[Guide|guide]] us, and the stars that light [[The Way|the way]]
*Arbiter: Serenus Starsong
Starsong is known for its stargazers, bards and artists, all of whom share a passion for the [[Constellations|constellations]] and [[Astronomancy|astronomancy]], using the essence of the stars to achieve their goals.
The spire was formed to focus arete in the creative arts and combine the knowledge of the stars as a muse for their creative works; whether that’s in a painting, a song, a performance, a poem or even just thinking outside of the box.
Starsong had a small spire hidden away amongst the collection of spires in the Arch of the Sky until the [[Druj]] came and razed it to the ground. The few members that managed to survive are now active in Anvil, and work on rebuilding the spire to its former [[Glory|glory]].
### Tropaion Citadel
*Purpose: Citadel
*Region: Proceris
*Apothegm: Utopia, no matter the [[Cost|cost]]
*Arbiter: Hector
Tropaion Citadel sits in Proceris, astride the Twilight [[Gate]], peering into Spiral. Built at the earliest [[Opportunity|opportunity]] following the scourging of Druj from Zenith, its two imposing towers sit on each side of the pass. Connected by thin wooden bridges, the residents of each tower use these areas to practice against each other, resulting in a jocular internal rivalry.
At Anvil, the Tropaion mission is clear. To espouse and extol the arete of [[The Sentinel|the sentinel]] in all of its forms. To advance the holy utopic mission of Urizen. To assist their magic using counterparts to the best of their ability. To eradicate [[Weakness|weakness]] and vulnerability from their nation, lest it ever fall to [[Barbarian|barbarian]] hands again.
### Zenith Ascendant
*Purpose: Arcane Spire
*Region: Occursion
*Apothegm: To build beyond the highest point
*Arbiter: Cadeus
The Spire formed in 383YE from a number of Highborn citizens from [[Reikos]] moving to Urizen, inviting people to temporary holdings in [[Redoubt]] whilst the Druj were expelled from Zenith. At the end of that campaign the Spire formally moved to the mountains near the shores of Bountiful Autumn in Occursion and began construction of their new spire.
The Spire is formed around a significant number of Autumn magicians, and although individuals follow their own virtues the Spire as a whole is a [[Prosperity]] sect, with those who join swearing an oath to work hard and bring [[Prosperity|prosperity]] to Zenith after the devastation wrought by the Druj. The Spire values it's architects highly; artifice and construction held in as much esteem as magic by many members. Indeed, all the efforts of the Spire focus around the restoration and improvement of Zenith, to once more see it ascendant in the Empire.
## Contributing
Any Urizen arcane spire, citadel or temple can submit an entry for this page. The entry should come from the out-of-character group leader and be emailed to [mailto:plot@profounddecisions.co.uk plot@profounddecisions.co.uk]. It should contain the following information:
* Name of the spire
* The kind of spire (arcane spire, citadel, temple)
* Your spire's ''apothegm'' assuming it is public knowledge
* Territory and region where the spire is physically located. If you are a spire in exile that has fled Zenith or Spiral you can mention that here
* If the spire has a sigil a description of that sigil or an image if one is available
* The name of your Arbiter if you have one
You should also include up to 250 words of description, detailing the kind of things that other [[Characters|characters]] might know about your spire. Have a look at the description for an arcane spire, citadel, or temple for ideas on the kind of information that is useful. For example, if you are from an an arcane spire, then what kind of magic are you known for? You must also include a few sentences of history, especially around the reasons for the spire's formation.
Some other questions to consider include:
* Does your spire have an interesting geographical feature associated with it? 
* Are there one or more particular [[Archetypes|archetypes]] it is associated with? 
* Does your spire have a particular philosophy or goal which helps unify your members?
Things to avoid include:
* Too much [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding worldbuilding] detail — this represents information other characters may know about your spire. It's not a place to define elements of [[The game|the game]] world
* Lists of character names — this isn't a place for getting your name on [[The wiki|the wiki]] 
* Too much emphasis on the past — while it's useful to have a few lines of history, what matters in Empire is what your spire does on the field at [[Events|events]]
It's possible to update the information on this page over time (for example if your arbiter changes) with an e-mail to [mailto:plot@profounddecisions.co.uk plot@profounddecisions.co.uk].
