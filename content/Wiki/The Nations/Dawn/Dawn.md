“Great deeds are [[Eternal|eternal]].”
Few lands espouse the heroic ideal in quite the same way the Dawnish do. When people think of the [[Dawn]] they imagine her favoured [[Children|children]], the nobility arrayed in armour, weapons drawn, eagerly seeking battle. Before them stand the [[Troubadours|troubadours]], singing or reciting the epic lays of past [[Heroes|heroes]]. Behind them, the [[War|war]] wizards, giving their strength to the battle.
[[Knights-errant]] travel the land, seeking an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to prove themselves and achieve [[Glory]]. Their nobility give battle in the tourney to judge who is fit to rule. The people turn their eyes on the enemies of [[The Empire|the Empire]], seeking victory and renown.
Her proud boasts are not hollow. Alone amongst [[The Nations|the nations]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]], the [[Dawn]] has never given up land to the [[Barbarians|barbarians]]. But the aspiration to achieve great things is not just found on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. Every Dawnish feels that same urge; this is a nation that eats and drinks [[Glory|glory]].
Enemies deride the nation for its stifling and outmoded system, where might makes right and the needs of ordinary people take second place to the quest for [[Glory|glory]]. And yet, they have forgotten the truth at its core - that great deeds are [[Eternal|eternal]].
## Five things about [[Dawn]]
*Nobility is an achievement, not a birthright. Nobility is vaunted in [[Dawn]], but it is a nobility of spirit they admire, not a title that you inherit.
*A great life leaves a legend. The only thing that remains when you depart this life is the memory of how you lived it. Death is nothing compared to great deeds.
*Glorious in victory, proud in defeat. The Dawnish relish a [[Challenge|challenge]]. Those more skilled present an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for [[Glory|glory]] by defeating them, those less skilled offer you an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to demonstrate your prowess.
*You cannot armour the soul. The Dawnish do not hide the great passions of the soul; they wear their hearts on their sleeve.
*Courtship, romance and tragedy. The rules of the heart are complex in [[Dawn]]; sometimes love is the greatest [[Challenge|challenge]].
## What the Dawnish are not
*Chivalrous. Dawnish nobility are always intensely competitive; they don't open doors for anybody, male or female. Dawnish women are independent and as obsessed with [[Glory|glory]] as their male counterparts.
*Required to be honourable. The Dawnish obsession is with triumph and renown; it does not demand a generous spirit.
