## Overview
The Rose Towers are a singular marvel, marrying functional [[Fortification|fortification]] with beauty and inspiration to create a place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] testifying to [[Pride]] in [[Dawn]]’s contributions to the [[Glory|glory]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. They were designed by Lord Caradoc of House Arien once held a reputation as one of [[Dawn]]'s finest architects before he retired to live out his days at Semmer's Rose. The construction that made him famous was designed and built as his test of mettle, a [[Commission|commission]] from the [[Earl]] of House Arien to create a beautiful palace in which every room would contain at least one window that faced the south garden. Although over eighty now, the Lord has worked tirelessly to create a design for a new tower to be constructed at Lacuve, building on the minor [[Fortifications|fortifications]] constructed near the town of Lacre.
The project was commissioned by Sandro Visconti di [[Sarvos]] as the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]], and funded wholly by Imperatrix Lisabetta, as the Queen of [[Dawn]]. Construction of the Towers was completed shortly before the 382YE [[Summer]] Solstice. 
The [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] of the Queen’s Rose has custodianship of this place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]].

## The Rose Towers
The Rose Towers stand in the region of Lacuve in [[Semmerholm]], in the rugged terrain abovethe town of Lacre leading down towards the border with Semmer’s Rose in Causse. 
These were originally constructed as watchtowers in the rugged [[Landscape|landscape]] between the Dawnish towns of Lacre and Semmer’s Rose, to guard against the presence of foes such as orc raiders from [[The Barrens|the Barrens]] and monsters out of the deep woods, and have also served as secure bases of operation for Questing Knights hunting the interlopers. 
Each tower [[Will|will]] contain countervailing stairs laid out so that it is possible to ascend by one stair well and then descend by the other. The walls [[Will|will]] then decorated with a set of tapestries, each depicting scenes of Dawnish triumph from the recent [[Semmerholm]] campaign. In this way, a hearty individual strong enough to climb and descend each tower in turn might revisit the story of the entire campaign in the course of their journey. 
In each central tower cavity, an ingenious [[Holberg]]-designed rising platform has been installed to ensure that any citizen, regardless of physical capability, may make [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to this important structure. Doughty yeofolk are employed at the Towers to haul on the ropes; further assist citizens who might face challenges with the many stairs; and to tell of the [[History|history]] of each of the richly coloured tapestries hung upon the Towers’ interior walls. 
Each upward journey depicts Dawnish contributions to [[The Empire|the Empire]], both cultural and martial, in a variety of styles sourced from the other nations of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. One tableau shows [[Children|children]] taking the Imperial citizenship test created by the Dawnish. Others show King Rodric’s abdication of his [[Throne|throne]] to pass his Test of Ardour; Dawnish [[Troubadours|troubadours]] founding [[The Three Refrains|the Three Refrains]] sodality of bards; [[Heroes|heroes]] of the [[Hounds of Glory]] fighting alongside [[Freeborn]] in the Liberation of [[Segura]] in 377YE; the recapture of [[Karsk]] by Dawnish and [[Wintermark]] forces; the [[Courage|courage]] of ‘Nightripper’s Bane’ Ser Isobel of [[Astolat]]; Dawnish [[War|war]] witches of the [[Eastern Sky]] aiding [[Unconquered]] and [[Navarr]] scouts to recover the recipe for [[Firewine]]; and Dawnish hosts who [[Fight|fight]] to liberate [[The Empress|the Empress]]’s own city of [[Holberg]]. 
The downward journeys depict more recent martial activities by Dawn, rendered in traditional Dawnish style, and show each scene of Dawnish triumph from the recent [[Semmerholm]] campaign.
At the foot of the central tower a brass plaque commemorates the successful collaboration between the Wayleave Holder Sandro Visconti di [[Sarvos]] and the [[Architect|architect]]. Nearby, a prominent tapestry shows a scene from [[Empress Lisabetta]]’s [[Past life vision|past life vision]]: [[Earl]] Nimue de Gauvain is girded in front of a long mirror, before she leads the [[Golden Sun]] to [[Fight|fight]] in [[Miaren]] alongside armies from [[The Marches|the Marches]] and [[The League|the League]]. 
At the very top of the highest arch of the central tower, a great circular stained glass window catches the light from the rising sun each morning. At its centre, the ‘Rose Window’ depicts Lady Jocelyn Cordraco, the [[Senator]] for [[Semmerholm]] who was murdered in mysterious circumstances at the [[Winter]] Solstice of 381YE. The motto underneath her portrait in this great window reads ‘Find Another Way’.
