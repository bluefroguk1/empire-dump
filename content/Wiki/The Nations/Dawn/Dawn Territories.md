[[Dawn]] is relatively flat, dotted with expanses of largely untamed forest and rocky crags. The forests are maintained by the noble houses of [[Dawn]] as part hunting preserve and part training ground. They are home to wild animals, bandits, monsters and ruins, and occasionally these inhabitants cause trouble for nearby villages.
