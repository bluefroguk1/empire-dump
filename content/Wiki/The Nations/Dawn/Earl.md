## Overview
An [[Earl|earl]] is the leader of a Dawnish [[Noble House]]. The title is used for people of any gender. Each [[Noble House|noble house]] appoints an [[Earl|earl]], to lead the house. Being the earl is an inherently political position; the character is not expected to undertake the kind of glorious actions appropriate for a Dawnish noble - instead their time and energies should be devoted to ensuring that the other members of their house have every possible help to act. In this way the [[Glory|glory]] of the house is ensured and it is this [[Glory|glory]] that reflects in turn upon the earl themselves.
## Setting Tests
One of the most important jobs of the earl is to setting Tests of Mettle, Ardour and Resolve. We have created a game design page especially to provide guidance on [[Setting a test]].
## Enchanters
An earl who possesses magical powers may style themselves an [[Enchanter|enchanter]] or enchantress. With the resources of an entire noble house to back them up, Enchanters can exert a great deal of influence over the nation. Sometimes an earl becomes an enchanter later in life, studying [[Magic|magic]] as a means to expand their personal power.
Most enchanters possess at least a basic mastery of [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magic|magic]], focusing on the magic of the [[Summer]] [[Realm]] (which grants strength to them and their troops) and the [[Autumn Realm]] (which deals with [[Prosperity|prosperity]] and influence). The primary [[Weakness|weakness]] of ritual magic from the point of view of an enchanter is that it is most powerful when supported by a group of ritual magicians, and Dawnish [[Noble Houses|noble houses]] tend to shy away from this practice in favour of the more glorious battlefield incantations.
Perhaps most importantly, an enchanter is in a good position to deal with the eternals on a more-or-less equal footing. Enchanters often pursue relationships with Summer eternals, who respect the personal power of a mighty individual more than they do the more diffuse power of a ritual group or lesser [[Magician|magician]].
