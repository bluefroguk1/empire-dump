A [[Troubadour|troubadour]] is a Dawnish priest who uses poetry, storytelling and song to recount the deeds of glorious [[Heroes|heroes]], both living and dead.
There exists an informal relationship between [[Troubadours|troubadours]] and the people, and generally fairly little ceremony between them. The tales recounted by troubadours often include reference to their hero or heroine's mistakes, follies, and even defeats before they reach the conclusion. A good [[Troubadour|troubadour]] wants their audience to identify with the subject of the verse and if they romanticize the tales a little, the goal is to make their subject seem glorious, not perfect.
Troubadours in the largest [[Dawn]] houses tend to study the [[History|history]] of their house's own [[Heroes|heroes]] alongside the tales and legends of the paragons. The best are adept at creating recitals that leave the listener in no doubt about the divine provenance of the house's [[Heroes|heroes]]. Some in the [[Imperial Synod]] consider this mix of personal history with official canon to be nothing short of blasphemous, but the Dawnish vigorously defend their traditions and their troubadours are careful to avoid ever explicitly claiming [[Paragon|paragon]] status for a hero without the [[Sanction|sanction]] of [[The Synod|the Synod]].
