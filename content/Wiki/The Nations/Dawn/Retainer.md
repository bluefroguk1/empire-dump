A [[Retainer|retainer]] is either a Dawnish noble's personal attendant or else an attendant to an entire [[Noble House]]. Retainers are always yeomen, although some harbour a desire to prove themselves and earn an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to pass a Test of Mettle.
The basic role of an attendant is to act as a skilled personal servant, ensuring that their noble, or the noble members of their house are able to enjoy the privileges of nobility. They are likely to help a noble dress themselves and prepare for battle, they fetch and serve drinks and so forth. However retainers are much more than simple servants, their roles often include handling a noble's money, arranging their personal finances and they often [[Fight|fight]] alongside the nobles.
In effect the social role of the [[Retainer|retainer]] is somewhere between a servant and a sidekick. Like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Elric and Moonglum, Batman and Alfred, Jeeves and Wooster, or Henry V and Falstaff - a good [[Retainer|retainer]] is a trusted accomplice. They may be the noble's best friend; there is often much rivalry and little friendship between nobles. They may even be lovers, although such a tryst is scandalous. In high society a [[Retainer|retainer]] must do everything to ensure that the noble or nobles they serve receive the respect they are due - a role that begins by being respectful themselves. In less serious circumstances both parties may relax and assume a more informal relationship.
## Creating a [[Retainer|retainer]]
There can be a huge amount of fun in playing a low-status character, but it is important to be certain that it is something that you want to do. There is no need for any noble or [[Noble House|noble house]] to be accompanied by a retainer, many are not, so the only reason to play one is if you think the role [[Will|will]] be fun. A retainer is never likely to be the focus of the action at plots, the character is inherently more likely to assume a [[Background|background]] role. What a good retainer character should be is busy, there should always be things to do; waiting on the nobility and arranging their [[Business|business]] for them.
