## Overview
Questing knights are romantic figures in [[Dawn]], knights-errant who continue to pursue an adventurous lifestyle after passing their Test of Mettle, seeking greater [[Glory]] for themselves and their houses. They travel far and wide across Dawn - a quest isn't just a monster to kill or a people to free from Barbarian tyranny, after all, but a long and arduous journey to get there first.
Questing knights strive to embody the high ideals not just of Dawn, but of the quest. If they come to a place where there is a wicked magistrate abusing their power, or a monster snatching children away, or an innocent young fellow about to be forced into a marriage he doesn't want, then it is their right and duty to right the wrong. Questing knights who ignore evil or danger that they meet along [[The Way]] are no better than mercenaries paid coin for their work. Most questing knights prefer to travel in the company of a [[Troubadour]], who can document their triumphs.
Some questing knights form groups called Knightly orders. A [[Knightly order]] may create and display their own heraldry. Noble membership of most knightly orders is by invitation only, and orders often require solemn oaths, as they have a glorious reputation of their own to protect.
## Creating a [[Questing knight]]
If you want to play a noble character who focuses on achieving glory and avoids the politics of playing in a [[Noble House]] then you should consider playing a questing knight. You should decide what noble house your character is part of - questing knights have already passed their Test of Mettle. If you know a group who are playing an existing noble house then you can ask them but you can play a knight who is part of an obscure minor house that is simply part of your own background.
Although the word knight is usually used to describe a Warrior, a questing knight can be any noble character - you might be a warrior but you could just as easily be a witch, a troubadour or a craftsman.
If you intend to play a questing knight, it is important to appreciate the large scale of the PD Empire [[Events]]. You will have epic opportunities for battles as part of a great army Fighting the orcs, but you won't be going off on a lone quest to slay a monster. It isn't possible to create that kind of experience for characters at an event where hundreds of players are attending.
## Creating a knightly order
A Knightly order is an order of questing knights, nobles who have completed their Test of Mettle but elected to continue questing together. A knightly order is similar to a noble house, but is less political and more focused on achieving glory.
