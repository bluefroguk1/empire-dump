## Overview
Questing knights are romantic figures in [[Dawn]], [[Knights-errant|knights-errant]] who continue to pursue an adventurous lifestyle after passing their Test of Mettle, seeking greater [[Glory]] for themselves and their houses. They travel far and wide across [[Dawn]] - a quest isn't just a monster to kill or a people to free from [[Barbarian|barbarian]] tyranny, after all, but a long and arduous journey to get there first.
Questing knights strive to embody the high ideals not just of [[Dawn]], but of the quest. If they come to a place where there is a wicked magistrate abusing their power, or a monster snatching [[Children|children]] away, or an innocent young fellow about to be forced into a marriage he doesn't want, then it is their right and duty to right the wrong. Questing knights who ignore evil or danger that they meet along [[The Way|the way]] are no better than mercenaries paid coin for their work. Most questing knights prefer to travel in the company of a [[Troubadour]], who can document their triumphs.
Some questing knights form [[Groups|groups]] called knightly orders. A [[Knightly order|knightly order]] may create and display their own heraldry. Noble membership of most knightly orders is by invitation only, and orders often require solemn oaths, as they have a glorious reputation of their own to protect.
## Creating a [[Questing knight|questing knight]]
If you want to play a noble character who focuses on achieving [[Glory|glory]] and avoids the politics of playing in a [[Noble House]] then you should consider playing a [[Questing knight|questing knight]]. You should decide what [[Noble House|noble house]] your character is part of - questing knights have already passed their Test of Mettle. If you know a group who are playing an existing [[Noble House|noble house]] then you can ask them but you can play a knight who is part of an obscure minor house that is simply part of your own [[Background|background]].
Although the word knight is usually used to describe a warrior, a [[Questing knight|questing knight]] can be any noble character - you might be a warrior but you could just as easily be a [[Witch|witch]], a [[Troubadour|troubadour]] or a craftsman.
If you intend to play a [[Questing knight|questing knight]], it is important to appreciate the large scale of the PD Empire [[Events|events]]. You [[Will|will]] have epic [[Opportunities|opportunities]] for [[Battles|battles]] as part of a great army fighting the orcs, but you won't be going off on a lone quest to slay a monster. It isn't possible to create that kind of experience for [[Characters|characters]] at an event where hundreds of players are attending.
## Creating a [[Knightly order|knightly order]]
A [[Knightly order]] is an order of questing knights, nobles who have completed their Test of Mettle but elected to continue questing together. A [[Knightly order|knightly order]] is similar to a [[Noble House|noble house]], but is less political and more focused on achieving [[Glory|glory]].
