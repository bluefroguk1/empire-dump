The [[Dawn]] zeal for a glorious life infects both yeofolk and noble alike. Every [[Challenge|challenge]] is an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to relish, a chance to better oneself, to prove one's [[Worth|worth]]. Most nobles devote their life to honing their [[Skills|skills]] and seeking out [[Opportunities|opportunities]] for [[Glory|glory]]. Every yeofolk who takes [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] knows that life is presenting them with an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to prove themselves and so the [[Imperial army]] recruiters can afford to pick and choose from long lines of volunteers.
Although triumph is the ultimate goal, the [[Glory|glory]] comes as much from attempting dangerous and difficult deeds as from succeeding. What draws disdain is not failure but inaction, passing up a chance for [[Glory|glory]] because of indecision or a fear of defeat. The Dawnish take failure as seriously as they take success, but mindless stupidity is not tolerated - [[Glory|glory]] accrues to those who did everything imaginable to succeed, not to those whose only plan was to throw themselves on their enemies swords.
The Dawnish believe that the more people know of your [[Glory|glory]], the more quickly you [[Will|will]] pass through the Labyrinth of Ages. They consider glory superior to the [[Wintermark]] notion of [[Heroism]] because glory requires the acknowledgement of your peers. Glorious acts are intrinsically difficult, it is not enough to be successful, the glorious individual must prove the act was noteworthy by accomplishing it in an impressive or dramatic way. Finding a loophole around a [[Challenge|challenge]] isn't useless - but it isn't glorious - for that is something anyone could have achieved. Glory is also different to [[Heroism|heroism]] in that only your own deeds matter, you are judged purely on your own merits, you cannot achieve glory by riding on another individuals success.
[[Troubadours]] argue over what constitutes the most glorious deed - the difficulty and [[Challenge|challenge]] of the deed are important but so is the motivation of those involved. Glorious deeds are not just difficult or dangerous they serve a higher purpose. To slay the dragon is glorious but it is more glorious still to do it for love.
