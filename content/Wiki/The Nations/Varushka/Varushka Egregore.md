## [[Mother Varushka]]
The Varushkan Egregore spirit is called Mother [[Varushka]], a familial indication of the high respect in which they are held. They epitomize the Varushkan tradition of a wise one, making time for any who need advice or help.
The Egregore works hard to maintain the Hearth Magics that keep everyday Varushkans safe. They are particularly concerned to ensure that Varushkans celebrate properly once the sun has set, and like to test any child they meet about the nation’s traditions and the meanings behind them.
## Current Hosts
Mother Varushka has two current hosts.
### Sirka the Wise One
Sirka Parakgoosier Bashnya from the Red Tower, known to Varushkan people as Wise One. He looks to the [[Vigilance]] of the Varushkan people and is always ready to give advice on the virtuous path to take and maybe give a Warming bowl of bigos too.
### Yelislaveta the Grandmother
Yelislaveta Syrnaova Vlanich, formerly of the Wychlovar and the [[Forest]] of White caves. A weaver of stories, known as ‘Grandmother’. She promotes the oldest traditions, and teaches the vigilance and [[Wisdom]] of understanding the monsters, to know when to kill them, when to bind them and when to use them. She is always happy to listen to your songs and stories and offer a few of her own.
