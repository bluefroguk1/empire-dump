"I am ready." 
## Overview
The [[Warden|warden]] fellowships of [[Varushka]] travel the Imperial roads across [[The Empire|the Empire]]. They often have a romantic reputation, being seen as dashing and heroic figures – in stories they often turn up just in the nick of time to help a band of beleaguered [[Schlacta|schlacta]] protect their vale. Most wardens combine skill at arms with a knowledge of [[Magic|magic]], creating and using amulets, talismans and other items against the threats of the Varushkan wilderness.
The [[Warden|warden]]'s motto, “''I am ready''” refers both to their willingness to take charge of difficult situations, and their belief in making sure they have right tool for any job. As a consequence many wardens build up broad [[Skills|skills]] with a number of weapons, adjusting their weaponry to the needs of [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. 
Many wardens are champions of [[Imperial Law]] actively pursuing lawbreakers and criminals to bring them before [[Magistrates]] for [[Judgement|judgement]]. Some chase criminals across national or even Imperial borders. Wardens may be hired to deal with particularly difficult supernatural threats and are sometimes seen as reckless as a result. Regardless, most are sensible enough not to needlessly arouse a sovereign, and a [[Warden|warden]] who causes a problem and then ignores it is likely to be cast out of their fellowship. 
The group of exclusively [[Changeling]] wardens known as the Company of the White Stag are considered a liability by their peers, leaving some wardens a little leery of working with any [[Changeling|changeling]]. Their group actively seeks out dangerous monsters to [[Challenge|challenge]], and often causes more trouble than they prevent.
## Creating a [[Warden]]
Wardens usually have martial [[Skills|skills]], but they also tend to pick up [[Crafting skills|crafting skills]] as well so that they can equip themselves and their allies with useful items such as amulets, talismans, weapons and armour.
If you intend to play a [[Warden|warden]], it is important to appreciate the large scale of the PD Empire [[Events|events]]. You [[Will|will]] have epic [[Opportunities|opportunities]] for [[Battles|battles]] as part of a great army fighting the orcs, but you won't be going off on a lone quest to slay a monster. It isn't possible to create that kind of experience for [[Characters|characters]] at an event where hundreds of players are attending.
Other activities that have clear resonance with the warden characterisation might include helping the Magistrates in their investigations, especially those that seem to have a magical flavour to them; keeping abreast of and involving oneself in [[Events|events]] on the field that concern any sort of supernatural evil, regardless of where those stories originate.
## Creating a Warden Fellowship
A warden fellowship is a good way to create a Varushkan group that is more interested in plot than politics and trade. Warden fellowships concern themselves with helping the vales deal with the threats of [[Varushka]], helping the magistrates enforce [[Imperial Law]] and keeping the nation together.
Most [[Characters|characters]] can be part of a fellowship, there is a place in any fellowship for schlacta, wise ones and [[Volhov|volhov]]. Lacking a vale to control the group [[Will|will]] not need a [[Boyar|boyar]], most [[Groups|groups]] of wardens pick one of their own to lead the fellowship as needed, but they rarely claim the title of boyar, as doing so can make their dealings with the boyars who run the vales and outposts more difficult.
Your fellowship may be larger than the characters portrayed by the players in the group - if members of the group wish to take small military units as their [[Downtime|downtime]] resources these can represent small groups of schlacta and wardens who serve the fellowship. 
Most fellowships endure over several generations and have a [[History|history]] of their own. Many begin as a consequence of a conflict with a sovereign, a figure that may be long defeated or that still exists as a threat to be dealt with.
A warden fellowship is usually based out of an old castle, [[Ruin|ruin]] or similar. You'll want to pick a [[Territory]] where your fellowship is based. If you're having trouble choosing, we recommend picking the territory with the fewest active groups in-game. If you are the only fellowship group in that territory you can assume a degree of responsibility for what happens there, if there are other fellowships based in the territory then it is [[Worth|worth]] trying to work with them.
