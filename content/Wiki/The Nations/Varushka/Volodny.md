Title: Volodny
---
## Overview
The [[Volodny]] are a circle of magicians from [[Varushka]] who present a threat to the entire Empire. 
They collaborated with the warlord [[Alderei the Fair]] to oppose the First Empress. They are said to wish to destroy the Varushkan people, and the Empire that they are part of.
The [[Volodny]] have made dreadful pacts with the Eternals of the Wasteland (the [[Winter]] Realm), and are said to be immortal as long as they maintain these pacts. They are known to have "hidden their hearts" outside their bodies, and cannot be permanently killed unless their hearts are found and destroyed.
While the [[Volodny]] focus their attention on [[Varushka]], they are a threat to the entire Empire and their malign influence could be felt by any Nation.
## Known Volodny
Conservative estimates suggest there may be as few as five volodny, or as many as fifteen, still in existance. This is by no means an exhaustive list and includes volodny believed to be deceased.
* [[Bas Celik]] - called the Binder. Believed to be active in the Empire since the death of [[Empress Britta]].
* Koshiev the White - alleged leader of the volodny executed during the fall of [[Alderei the Fair]]. 
* Górować - a powerful Night mage who was instrumental in the battles between Navarr and Vard in [[Hercynia]]. Their heart was apparently destroyed by Varushkan heroes during the Spring Equinox 384YE
* Shadowsmith - an [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] of unparalleled skill associated with the city of [[Temeschwar]].
* Kareina of the Swans - called Silvertongue. Attempted to turn [[Urizen]] against the Empire, and appears as a diplomat
* Breknia - allegedly a weak volodny believed to have been destroyed several centuries ago
## Historical Research
