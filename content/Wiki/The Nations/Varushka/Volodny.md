## Overview
The [[Volodny]] are a circle of magicians from [[Varushka]] who present a threat to the entire Empire. 
They collaborated with the [[Warlord|warlord]] [[Alderei the Fair]] to oppose the [[First Empress]]. They are said to wish to destroy the Varushkan people, and [[The Empire|the Empire]] that they are part of.
The [[Volodny]] have made dreadful pacts with the Eternals of the Wasteland (the [[Winter]] [[Realm]]), and are said to be immortal as long as they maintain these pacts. They are known to have "hidden their hearts" outside their bodies, and cannot be permanently killed unless their hearts are found and destroyed.
