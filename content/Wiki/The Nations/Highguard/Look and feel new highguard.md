=Overview= 
Regal, confident, righteous, stark, traditional, disciplined, militant, uncompromising
The Highborn aesthetic is practical and restrained. Its beauty is in the small touches – the geometric trim on the robes, the exquisite jewelry. Colours are deliberately stark and contrasting, and outfits in black and white are commonplace. Many members of a [[Chapter|chapter]], particularly warriors, choose to adopt a uniform look, displaying the symbol of their [[Chapter|chapter]] prominently. This inclination towards unity serves as a visible display of their inner commitment to a shared faith and destiny.
Rather than displaying impractical frivolity in the cut of their garments, Highborn show their taste and wealth in jewellery, and the decoration of cloth. Jewelled and embellished trims at the hems of garments are popular, as is the intricate braiding of hair and heavy, elaborate jewellery.

## Costume Fundamentals
Hood, Veil, or Cowl: The iconic item of Highborn kit is a head covering. [[Highguard]] veils are worn on the top of the head, held in place with a circlet or head band. They can be flipped forward to cover the face, or back to reveal it. Cowls and hoods are very wide and draped, sitting on the shoulders, and pulled over the head when necessary. 
Surcoat or Tabard: A common item of highborn costume is a flowing surcoat or tabard in black or white with the [[Chapter|chapter]]'s symbol prominently displayed. Underneath, highborn will wear tunics, shirts or dresses in chapter colours or plain black and white. 
Stole: Stoles are used by many highborn who have a religious vocation. 
Coats or Cloak: Elegant close-fitting coats are often worn by highborn. A plain cloak in chapter colours is an a practical item to protect its wearer from the weather. 
Jewellery: Jewellery is refined, often simple, and elegant. Circlets and crowns are the most popular elements of Jewellery. 
### Fabrics and Colour Palette
The colours of highborn clothing are highly contrasting; black and white, with touches of their chapter's colour, which is often a strong jewel tone. 
Almost any fabric is appropriate, so long as it fits within the colour scheme. Textural interest can be useful when creating richer looking clothing within the colour scheme, and brocades, velvets and other textured fabric are really effective. 
Geometric or labyrinthine trim is a popular decorative feature, and is widely used. 
=War=
Fighting in chapter units, Highborn cataphracts often go for a uniform look. 
## Armour
Heavy metal plate, painted or unpainted, is common, as is chain and leather, although armour that can show off the flowing surcoat is preferred. 
## Weapons
Highborn warriors tend to fight in close formation, and use weapons suited to that; short weapons, spears, shields, and bows are popular. 
Heater and Kite shields are common, often bearing the chapter's symbol. 
## [[Unconquered]]
While the [[Unconquered|unconquered]] might dress like any other highborn while not at war, their clothing on the battlefield incorporates less high contrast, bringing in browns and greys. They tend to wear lighter armour, or forego armour altogether. They may still include contrasting trim or a chapter symbol. 
=Priests= 
Many priests wear robes in black or white as the base of their clothing. Stoles are very common, often bearing symbols of the priest's chapter and their sect. Their exact costume depends on their vocation. 
Warfarers dress in typical highborn fashion, adding a braided sash or belt of black and white cloth to demonstrate their vocation.  
Priests who embrace an inquisitorial role often use the image of the Basilisk Awake – a lizard with terrible red eyes that legend says can strike the unworthy dead with is piercing gaze.
The stewards generally dress in simple robes in the style of whichever chapter they belong to. They often carry a book to record the deeds of heroes, and may carry bells and wind-chimes, which they use to allow the breath of the dead to add their own contribution to the tales of their deeds.
=Mages= 
While magisters dress very similarly to priests, most forego a stole, and will often carry their magical accoutrements.  
Tools used in magic are often simple and elegant; plain staffs with contrasting decoration, bowls and vials the same, often wide and shallow. 
### Mage Armour
Circlets, ornamental sections of scale, and coloured metal are all common features of highborn mage armour, and shoulder pieces in the shape of conventional armour are also popular. Leather is also used, and often shaped to echo the style of traditional metal armour. 
=Children=
Clothing for Highborn children is usually sombre, simple, and practical but good quality, with more delicate garments reserved until they come of age.
=Camps=
A chapter's camp aims to be distinctive; banners and prominently displayed shields are popular. There is usually a bowl and water provided for washing. 
If the chapter's camp is large, it may be gathered around a central space or fire, and it is common for chapters to eat communal meals if circumstances permit 
=Similar Nations= 
Dawnish costume utilises similar items of clothing, and rich fabrics. However, Dawnish use of bright colours create a difference between the nations. 
Marcher monks will also wear plain robes, but they are very unlikely to use high contrast or geometric trim. 
[[Unconquered]] costume is designed to blend into the surroundings and may use similar styles and colours to the Navarr, but unconquered do not use prominent tattoos or warpaint.
=What to Avoid= 
*Christian symbols- while Templars and Crusader knights are inspiration for the [[Highguard]] look, Christian symbols are inappropriate in Empire.
