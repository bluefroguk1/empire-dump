## Guise
Guise is the [[Egregore]] of [[The League]], and like many things in that nation their identity is complicated with layers of masks and riddles. There are usually multiple egregores, usually one for each of the cities - but rarely if ever do all of them gather in one place. Each host wears wearing a mask and takes an archetypal title in place of a name. Collectively they are referred to as being ‘Guise’ yet none directly answer to that name - nor to the name they held before bonding with the egregore spirit. 
While each egregore tends to feel a connection to one of [[The League|the League]] cities, they nonetheless represent the nation as a whole. It is traditional for those undertaking an important action to discuss their intentions with the egregore, and it is understood that anything shared with the egregore in confidence will go no further.
Those currently regularly observed at Anvil have also been the Contessa, the Harlequin and the Reckoner.
The Harlequin is a rogue and a charmer, who claims to have but recently overcome the ban on public action placed on him by the other aspect of Guise – though this is disputed. Whatever the truth, wherever he goes, there is gossip, drama, and a social whirl.
