[[The Chamber|The chamber]] is a [[Throne|throne]], a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic|magic]].
[[Realm]]: [[Night]].
Setting: This represents privacy, a place where masks come off an [[Characters|characters]] are honest to one another. It may be a bedchamber or a privy chamber - a place of secrets, passion and plots. The tale told might be of secret assignations, of private messages given and received, of dark desires confessed and gratified. The 'bedroom farce' can be another approach to the [[Night ritual|night ritual]], playing up the themes of deceit, misunderstanding and subterfuge in a comedic fashion. 
[[Characters]]: [[The Witch]] and [[The Mountebank]] are strong characters in this setting; they are often veiled, and often portrayed as [[Naga]]. Their understanding of passion, deception and mysteries come to the fore. Their natures often reverse; a comedic [[Mountebank]] is serious in [[The Chamber|the chamber]], a clever [[Witch]] is sensuous. 
Magical Style: This is often a location where a [[Weakness|weakness]] is exposed, or a fact revealed; this makes [[The Chamber|the chamber]] a good fit for the [[Magic|magic]] of divination. It is also a place where people change their attire, making it a good fit for transformation [[Magic|magic]]. 
[[Rituals]] that uncover or conceal things through [[Night magic]] are made stronger here, but so are themes of transformation, passion or intuition. A [[Ritual|ritual]] from another [[Realm]] that deals with these themes is empowered by juxtaposing obvious elements ([[The Doctor]] and [[The Lantern]] for divination) with the less obvious elements of [[The Chamber|the chamber]] (a divination that deals with unravelling a [[Night Realm|Night realm]] [[Enchantment]] despite the fact the ritual performed is from the [[Day Realm|Day realm]]) .
