[[The Cup|The cup]] is one of the [[Dramaturgy#The Instruments|instruments]] or [[Dramaturgy]]. As such it often represents the method used in a magical ritual. A [[Troupe|troupe]] will often have a specific prop that they use for [[The Cup|the cup]] whenever it appears, and may in time come to treat the inanimate object a little like a member of the cast.
Appearance:A [[Troupe|troupe]]'s chalice may be represented by anything from a gem-studded goblet made of precious metals to a simple wooden mazer; the significance is that it holds liquid. It is also commonly presented as a [[Potion]], or as a magical liquid that causes a change.
Meanings: On its own, it represents prosperity and fulfilment, but as it is passed between the Personae its meaning changes.
When held by [[The Captain]], [[The Cup|the cup]] represents celebration and triumph; in the hands of [[The Prince]], it represents prosperity on a national or Imperial scale. When held by [[The Bishop]] it represents purity and cleansing, especially in rituals such as [[Ascetic Star of Atun]]. In the hands of [[The Mountebank]] it signifies unleashed emotions, confusion and drunkenness. For [[The Doctor]] it represents assistance or aid - [[Enchantment|enchantments]] may be created by [[The Doctor|the doctor]], or it might be a bitter medicine that inflicts a curse. Finally, in the hands of [[The Witch]] it represents magical potions, and the transformations they can bring or wine that encourages others to speak the truth. 
''For Hearthfire circle''
[[The Bishop]] as Couros represents bonds, she gives the cup to [[The Captain]] as Scorrero and his band of warriors. Speech about being ready for battle tomorrow?  ''Obvious. Did it last year during the battle at Karsk.''
[[The Witch]] as Couros represents bonds, he passes the chalice around the coven. ''Bland. 'When shall we meet again' rubbish.''
Scorrero is [[The Captain]] of a [[Troupe|troupe]] of actors; the band have fallen ill and can't perform, so [[The Bishop]] in the role of [[The Prince|the Prince]]'s wife brings them a potion of healing (check with apothecary for details), allowing them to perform for [[The Prince]]. We actors are a synonym for magic, make one of them [[The Witch]] - Gregario doing his languid lush will do it if we stick him in the cowl. ''Like it. We'll do this one, as long as Gregario stays sober.''
