[[The Library]] is a throne, a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic]].
Realm: Day.
Setting: The airy library of an [[Urizen]] [[Spire]], a cramped Varushkan wise one's hut or a dusty [[Highguard]] scroll-room, the courtroom of a magistrate or an ice-cavern beneath [[Wintermark]] with rune-covered walls - all of these may evoke the Library. It is always a place of learning, where knowledge and [[Wisdom]] are applied. It is sometimes the Chapel, where meditation and introspection take place.
Characters: [[The Doctor]] and [[The Bishop]] are strong characters in this setting; they uncover or declaim tRuths, discover secrets and reveal important Events. It is also a place where people receive news of distant events. Any character may reveal their innermost thoughts here.
Magical Style: This is a place of knowledge, where information is uncovered and hidden things found. Divination Rituals take place here. It is also a place of introspection and meditation - purification is a theme, as is Healing. It is obvious that rituals such as Swim [[Leviathan]]'s Depth may be performed here, but so might a ritual such as [[Winds of Fortune]], where [[The Prince]] pores over a map of distant lands, or [[Clarity of the Master Strategist]] where [[The Captain]] and the Doctor discuss difficult choices for the coming battle.
