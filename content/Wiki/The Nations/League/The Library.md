[[The Library|The library]] is a [[Throne|throne]], a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic|magic]].
[[Realm]]: [[Day]].
Setting: The airy library of an [[Urizen]] [[Spire|spire]], a cramped Varushkan [[Wise One|wise one]]'s hut or a dusty [[Highguard]] scroll-room, the courtroom of a magistrate or an ice-cavern beneath [[Wintermark]] with [[Rune|rune]]-covered walls - all of these may evoke [[The Library|the Library]]. It is always a place of learning, where knowledge and [[Wisdom|wisdom]] are applied. It is sometimes the Chapel, where meditation and introspection take place.
[[Characters]]: [[The Doctor]] and [[The Bishop]] are strong [[Characters|characters]] in this setting; they uncover or declaim truths, discover secrets and reveal important [[Events|events]]. It is also a place where people receive news of distant [[Events|events]]. Any character may reveal their innermost thoughts here.
Magical Style: This is a place of knowledge, where information is uncovered and hidden things found. Divination [[Rituals|rituals]] take place here. It is also a place of introspection and meditation - purification is a theme, as is healing. It is obvious that [[Rituals|rituals]] such as Swim [[Leviathan]]'s Depth may be performed here, but so might a [[Ritual|ritual]] such as [[Winds of Fortune]], where [[The Prince|the Prince]] pores over a map of distant lands, or [[Clarity of the Master Strategist]] where [[The Captain|the Captain]] and [[The Doctor|the Doctor]] discuss difficult choices for the coming battle.
