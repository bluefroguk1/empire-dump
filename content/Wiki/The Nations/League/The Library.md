[[The Library|The library]] is a [[Dramaturgy#The Thrones|throne]], a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a Realm of magic.
Realm: Day.
Setting: The airy library of an Urizen spire, a cramped Varushkan wise one's hut or a dusty Highguard scroll-room, the courtroom of a magistrate or an ice-cavern beneath Wintermark with rune-covered walls - all of these may evoke [[The Library|the Library]]. It is always a place of learning, where knowledge and wisdom are applied. It is sometimes the Chapel, where meditation and introspection take place.
Characters: [[The Doctor]] and [[The Bishop]] are strong characters in this setting; they uncover or declaim truths, discover secrets and reveal important events. It is also a place where people receive news of distant events. Any character may reveal their innermost thoughts here.
Magical Style: This is a place of knowledge, where information is uncovered and hidden things found. Divination rituals take place here. It is also a place of introspection and meditation - purification is a theme, as is healing. It is obvious that rituals such as [[Swim Leviathan's Depth]] may be performed here, but so might a ritual such as [[Winds of Fortune]], where [[The Prince|the Prince]] pores over a map of distant lands, or [[Clarity of the Master Strategist]] where [[The Captain|the Captain]] and [[The Doctor|the Doctor]] discuss difficult choices for the coming battle.
