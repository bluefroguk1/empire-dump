[[The Blade|The blade]] is one of the [[Dramaturgy#The Instruments|instruments]] or [[Dramaturgy]]. As such it often represents the method used in a magical ritual. A [[Troupe|troupe]] will often have a specific prop that they use for [[The Blade|the blade]] whenever it appears, and may in time come to treat the inanimate object a little like a member of the cast.
Appearance: A real weapon or a painted wooden prop, [[The Blade|the Blade]] represents conflict, war and suffering. Some very theatrical troupes construct hinged or spring-loaded props which can transform rapidly from knife to sword and back again as it is handed back and forth. Some especially self-satisfied troupes have taken to replacing the blade with a letter, pamphlet or quill pen. This is more common in [[Sarvos]] than anywhere else and is sometimes called ''The Sarvosan Conceit'' when it is observed by troupes from other cities.
Meanings: The blade deals with conflict, war, suffering and combat but it also deals with healing and removal of obstacles. It has an element of sacrifice in it, and is a key to rituals such as [[Sorin's Rite of Agony]] that specifically involve a sacrifice,
When carried by [[The Captain]], it represents individual combat, and powers that enhance combat skills such as [[The Swan's Cruel Wing]]. With [[The Prince]] it represents armies and nations at war, and so has a role in rituals such as [[Clarity of the Master Strategist]]. With [[The Bishop]], it is often used to represent truth or righteousness, but also things that deal with alliances - [[Ambassadorial Gatekeeper]] for example,especially when performed on members of a [[Groups#Banners|banner]] with a strong connection to the Way. In the hands of a [[Mountebank]] it is military subterfuge, hidden knives and the like and may be used in a ritual such as [[Shroud of Mist and Shadow]]. In hands of [[The Doctor]] it becomes the Scalpel and is associated with the process of cutting away something bad to allow necessary and painful healing; it might be used with [[Black Iron Blade]], [[Renewed Strength of the New Day]] or [[Vitality of Rushing Water]] with equal facility. When carried by [[The Witch]] it is called the Aetheme, and signifies magical authority and mastery over foreign spirits - such as those evoked with [[Clarion Call of Ivory and Dust]] or [[Conclave of Trees and Shadow]].
