[[The Counting House|The counting house]] is a [[Throne|throne]], a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic|magic]].
[[Realm]]: [[Autumn]].
Setting: [[The Counting House|The counting house]] may be any location where money or power are themes. It might be a [[Business|business]], a tavern or an antechamber of [[The Senate|the Senate]], [[Conclave]] or [[Synod]]. Sometimes it is a forge or workshop where skill is used to create special items. The drama often focuses on transactions and accounts. It is also often [[The Prince|the Prince]]'s court, where rewards and punishments are handed down. Along with [[The Tomb]] it is a common place for a play or [[Ritual|ritual]] to end in the case of a multi-act drama.
[[Characters]]: [[The Witch]] and [[The Prince]] are strong [[Characters|characters]] in this setting; they wield influence and manipulate both other characters and situations to their own ends. [[The Witch|The witch]] influences political situations, even those that appear quite minor such as the relationship between [[Family|family]] members, while the prince makes decisions that determine the fate of many, make fortunes - or [[Ruin|ruin]] them. 
Magical Style: This is often a location where wealth and influence is wielded. A ritual that creates wealth, a ritual that recognises or trades something, or some quality. It is also a location where [[Magic|magic]] that targets items and objects is powerful. 
[[Rituals]] that enchant or [[Curse]] personal resources are often performed here, as are those that track connections between people or items, and magic that exerts subtle influence. [[The Lure of Distant Shores]] and [[Chamber of Pallas]] are both appropriate here, but so are any number of [[Rituals|rituals]] that target members of a band, or that create connections or special items. [[Tribute to the Thrice-Cursed Court]] may be performed here, for example - perhaps in as scene where the Prince gives a gift to a foreign [[Witch]].
