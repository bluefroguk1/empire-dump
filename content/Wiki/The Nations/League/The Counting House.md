[[The Counting House]] is a throne, a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic]].
Realm: Autumn.
Setting: The counting house may be any location where money or power are themes. It might be a business, a tavern or an antechamber of the Senate, Conclave or Synod. Sometimes it is a forge or workshop where skill is used to create special items. The drama often focuses on transactions and accounts. It is also often [[The Prince]]'s court, where reWards and punishments are handed down. Along with [[The Tomb]] it is a common place for a play or ritual to end in the case of a multi-act drama.
Characters: [[The Witch]] and The Prince are strong characters in this setting; they wield influence and manipulate both other characters and situations to their own ends. The witch influences political situations, even those that appear quite minor such as the relationship between [[Family]] members, while the prince makes decisions that deterMine the fate of many, make fortunes - or [[Ruin]] them. 
Magical Style: This is often a location where wealth and influence is wielded. A ritual that creates wealth, a ritual that recognises or trades something, or some quality. It is also a location where magic that targets items and objects is powerful. 
Rituals that enchant or [[Curse]] personal resources are often performed here, as are those that track connections between people or items, and magic that exerts subtle influence. [[The Lure of Distant Shores]] and [[Chamber of Pallas]] are both appropriate here, but so are any number of rituals that target members of a band, or that create connections or special items. [[Tribute to the Thrice-Cursed Court]] may be performed here, for example - perhaps in as scene where the Prince gives a gift to a foreign Witch.
