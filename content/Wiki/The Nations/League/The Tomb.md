[[The Tomb]] is a throne, a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic]].
Realm: Winter.
Setting: The Tomb may be an actual tomb or mausoleum, or it may be a graveyard or even a battlefield after a battle. Rituals that take place in the tomb can be mournful tragedies, chilling ghost stories or dark morality tales, but usually have a sinister undertone. The Tomb may also be represented by the Gate or [[The Door]] - a transitional point between one place and another where conspirators meet, or where characters are separated from each other or from the things they desire by the final closing of a door.
Characters: [[The Doctor]] and [[The Prince]] are strong characters in this setting; they wield authority and deal with questions of life and death. The Doctor sometimes becomes a gravedigger in this scene, while the Prince may be re-imagined as a ghost, or sometimes even an [[Eternal]]. 
Magical Style: This is often a location where someone is Cursed, doomed or condemned for their actions. It is a place where things come to their conclusions, and it is a place where promises and oaths are made, especially between conspirators or in the name of a dead person. 
Rituals that create curses, that inflict [[Weakness]] or [[Venom]], or that deal with fear and dread are often enacted here. Any ritual that invokes themes of the past, or of [[Wisdom]], may also benefit from being set in the tomb. The most obvious use for The Tomb location is in rituals that deal directly with the dead such as [[Whispers through the Black Gate]].
### The Dolmen
A rare incarnation of The Tomb, found almost exclusively in the northern Marches, is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmen dolmen]. A specific arrangement of stones, these dolmen have occasionally been used to mark ancient tombs, burial sites, and Winter [[Regio]]. Some mummers recreate these dolmen in their plays or stage irregular performances in which an old dolmen forms a pivotal part. Ritual magic enacted in and around dolmen is primarily associated with the binding or communicating with ghosts.
