[[The Lantern|The lantern]] is one of the instruments or [[Dramaturgy]]. As such it often represents the method used in a magical [[Ritual|ritual]]. A [[Troupe|troupe]] [[Will|will]] often have a specific prop that they use for [[The Lantern|the lantern]] whenever it appears, and may in time come to treat the inanimate object a little like a member of the cast.
Appearance: Often a lantern which can be hooded and shuttered; also a lamp or a candle. It is sometimes jewelled, and used with stage effects to provide a great deal of light. Also, the mirror.
Meanings: On its own, it represents illumination and knowledge. It is often used when a character is seeking something, and sometimes used in [[Rituals|rituals]] where another [[Coven|coven]] might use either the [[Rune|rune]] of discovery or rune of revelation. If it is left unlit, it often means a mystery or secret - the act of lighting it is the act of uncovering or divining that secret. 
When held by [[The Captain]], [[The Lantern|the lantern]] signifies [[Honesty|honesty]] and directness, and pierces illusion and concealment; in the hands of [[The Prince]], it stands for the illumination and elevation of a group, such as through [[Rituals|rituals]] that grant [[Skills|skills]] or abilities. When held by [[The Bishop]] it represents the 'light of faith' and empowers [[Rituals|rituals]] that create emotional effects, suppress [[Confusion|confusion]] or grant clarity. In the hands of [[The Mountebank]] it signifies flashy attempts to bamboozle and dissemble, and is often extinguished. With [[The Doctor]] it means  inquiry, especially with [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Bright Lantern of Ophis]] or [[Wisdom of the Balanced Blade]]. With [[The Witch]] it represents occult [[Wisdom|wisdom]] and things that deal with the [[Realms|realms]] - sometimes eternals
''For Bright Lantern of [[Ophis]]; I want to get to the bottom of this [[Enchantment|enchantment]] nonsense, [[The Prince|the Prince]] is prepared to pay well ...''
A Counting House. [[The Doctor]] is there as a beggar, ignored. The [[Mountebank]] and [[The Witch|the Witch]] are there as lovers, discussing a plan to use a [[Potion|potion]] (special cup?) to drug [[The Prince]] and his guests (too obvious?). Concerned about some Badger called Gancio. [[The Doctor]] overhears the conspiracy (fill in details;  use that speech from  'the Merchant and the Shrew'). Comedy [[Business|business]] with clowns, travelling salesman with potence-[[Potion|potion]], plenty of cock jokes for the cheap seats. Conspirators return after dark with [[Potion|potion]], some business with a cook; before they can enact crime, [[The Doctor]] with a lantern surprises them, revealed as badger; [[Mountebank]] and [[Witch]] arrested, sentenced and punished by Doctor. 
Bish, bash, bosh - ritual penetrates the shroud, [[Enchantment|enchantment]] unravelled, we're paid so well we need help to hold up our trousers .''
