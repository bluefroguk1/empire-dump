[[The Lantern]] is one of the instruments or [[Dramaturgy]]. As such it often represents the method used in a Magical ritual. A [[Troupe]] will often have a specific prop that they use for the lantern whenever it appears, and may in time come to treat the inanimate object a little like a member of the cast.
Appearance: Often a lantern which can be hooded and shuttered; also a lamp or a candle. It is sometimes jewelled, and used with stage effects to provide a great deal of light. Also, the mirror.
Meanings: On its own, it represents illumination and knowledge. It is often used when a character is seeking something, and sometimes used in [[Rituals]] where another coven might use either the rune of discovery or rune of revelation. If it is left unlit, it often means a mystery or secret - the act of lighting it is the act of uncovering or divining that secret. 
When held by [[The Captain]], the lantern signifies [[Honesty]] and directness, and pierces illusion and concealment; in the hands of [[The Prince]], it stands for the illumination and elevation of a group, such as through rituals that grant [[Skills]] or abilities. When held by [[The Bishop]] it represents the 'light of faith' and Empowers rituals that create emotional effects, suppress confusion or grant clarity. In the hands of [[The Mountebank]] it signifies flashy attempts to bamboozle and dissemble, and is often extinguished. With [[The Doctor]] it means  inquiry, especially with rituals such as [[Bright Lantern of Ophis]] or [[Wisdom of the Balanced Blade]]. With [[The Witch]] it represents occult [[Wisdom]] and things that deal with the realms - sometimes Eternals
''For Bright Lantern of [[Ophis]]; I want to get to the bottom of this [[Enchantment]] nonsense, the Prince is prepared to pay well ...''
A Counting House. The Doctor is there as a beggar, ignored. The [[Mountebank]] and the Witch are there as lovers, discussing a plan to use a [[Potion]] (special cup?) to drug The Prince and his guests (too obvious?). Concerned about some Badger called Gancio. The Doctor overhears the conspiracy (fill in details;  use that speech from  'the Merchant and the Shrew'). Comedy business with clowns, travelling salesman with potence-potion, plenty of cock jokes for the cheap seats. Conspirators return after dark with potion, some business with a cook; before they can enact crime, The Doctor with a lantern surprises them, revealed as badger; Mountebank and Witch arrested, sentenced and punished by Doctor. 
Bish, bash, bosh - ritual penetrates the shroud, enchantment unravelled, we're paid so well we need help to hold up our trousers .''
