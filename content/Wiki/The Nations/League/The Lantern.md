[[The Lantern|The lantern]] is one of the [[Dramaturgy#The Instruments|instruments]] or [[Dramaturgy]]. As such it often represents the method used in a magical ritual. A [[Troupe|troupe]] will often have a specific prop that they use for [[The Lantern|the lantern]] whenever it appears, and may in time come to treat the inanimate object a little like a member of the cast.
Appearance: Often a lantern which can be hooded and shuttered; also a lamp or a candle. It is sometimes jewelled, and used with stage effects to provide a great deal of light. Also, the mirror.
Meanings: On its own, it represents illumination and knowledge. It is often used when a character is seeking something, and sometimes used in rituals where another [[Groups#Covens|coven]] might use either the [[Sular|rune of discovery]] or [[Ophis|rune of revelation]]. If it is left unlit, it often means a mystery or secret - the act of lighting it is the act of uncovering or divining that secret. 
When held by [[The Captain]], [[The Lantern|the lantern]] signifies honesty and directness, and pierces illusion and concealment; in the hands of [[The Prince]], it stands for the illumination and elevation of a group, such as through rituals that grant skills or abilities. When held by [[The Bishop]] it represents the 'light of faith' and empowers rituals that create emotional effects, suppress confusion or grant clarity. In the hands of [[The Mountebank]] it signifies flashy attempts to bamboozle and dissemble, and is often extinguished. With [[The Doctor]] it means  inquiry, especially with rituals such as [[Bright Lantern of Ophis]] or [[Wisdom of the Balanced Blade]]. With [[The Witch]] it represents occult wisdom and things that deal with the realms - sometimes [[Eternal|eternals]]
''For Bright Lantern of Ophis; I want to get to the bottom of this enchantment nonsense, [[The Prince|the Prince]] is prepared to pay well ...''
A Counting House. [[The Doctor]] is there as a beggar, ignored. [[The Mountebank]] and [[The Witch|the Witch]] are there as lovers, discussing a plan to use a potion (special cup?) to drug [[The Prince]] and his guests (too obvious?). Concerned about some Badger called Gancio. [[The Doctor]] overhears the conspiracy (fill in details;  use that speech from  'the Merchant and the Shrew'). Comedy business with clowns, travelling salesman with potence-potion, plenty of cock jokes for the cheap seats. Conspirators return after dark with potion, some business with a cook; before they can enact crime, [[The Doctor]] with a lantern surprises them, revealed as badger; [[Mountebank]] and Witch arrested, sentenced and punished by Doctor. 
Bish, bash, bosh - ritual penetrates the shroud, enchantment unravelled, we're paid so well we need help to hold up our trousers .''
