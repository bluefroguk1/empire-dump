[[The Battlefield|The battlefield]] is a [[Dramaturgy#The Thrones|throne]], a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a Realm of magic.
Realm: Summer.
Setting: [[The Battlefield]] is most commonly presented as either a military camp, or as a castle or fortification. Themes of war, conflict, strength and the threat of death are all strengthened on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. The story might involve preparations for a battle, the arming of a mighty warrior or the fight itself (often a duel) and its aftermath. 
Characters: [[The Captain]] and [[The Bishop]] are strong characters in this setting; they are often larger-than-life, taking on iconic roles as figureheads or representations of patriotic, political or religious themes. [[The Captain]] leads, and [[The Bishop|the Bishop]] inspires; it is here that they are at their most majestic. 
Magical Style: This is often a location where someone is strengthened, or commits themselves to action. 
Rituals that create [[Enchantment|enchantments]] of strength, [[Combat skills#Endurance|endurance]] or that grant martial abilities such as [[The Hammer of Thunder]] or [[Alignment of Mind and Blade]] are made stronger here. Any ritual that targets a [[Military unit]], fortification, campaign army or [[Groups#Banners|banner]] may be performed in this setting.
