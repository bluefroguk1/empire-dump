[[The Battlefield]] is a throne, a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic]].
Realm: Summer.
Setting: The Battlefield is most commonly presented as either a military camp, or as a castle or [[Fortification]]. Themes of [[War]], conflict, strength and the threat of death are all strengthened on the battlefield. The story might involve preparations for a battle, the arming of a mighty warrior or the [[Fight]] itself (often a duel) and its aftermath. 
Characters: [[The Captain]] and [[The Bishop]] are strong characters in this setting; they are often larger-than-life, taking on iconic roles as figureheads or representations of patriotic, political or religious themes. The Captain leads, and the [[Bishop]] inSpires; it is here that they are at their most majestic. 
Magical Style: This is often a location where someone is strengthened, or commits themselves to action. 
Rituals that create Enchantments of strength, endurance or that grant martial abilities such as The [[Hammer of Thunder]] or [[Alignment of Mind and Blade]] are made stronger here. Any ritual that targets a [[Military unit]], fortification, campaign army or banner may be performed in this setting.
