[[The Coin]] is one of the instruments of [[Dramaturgy]]. As such it often represents the method used in a Magical ritual. A [[Troupe]] will often have a specific prop that they use for [[The Cup]] whenever it appears, and may in time come to treat the inanimate object a little like a member of the cast.
Appearence: Another small prop, the Coin is sometimes represented by a bag fUll of jingling metal, a single gold coin, or an outsize model of a coin, the better to catch the eye of the audience. It may also be used in any number of other circular forms, such as shields or plates. Some dramaturgists consider it bad luck to use actual Imperial [[Currency]] as a prop on stage - they argue that any coin used in a dramaturgic performance may become infused with some of the [[Magic]] of the ritual, to the potential detriment of anyone who later uses it to buy a loaf of bread.
Meanings: It represents transactions and reWards, whether positive or negative. Usually the meaning is conveyed when the coin is given by a character in payment for goods or services in the play.
When given by [[The Captain]], the coin represents treasure or great value, especially with rites such as [[Ephisis]]' Scale. Held in the hands of [[The Prince]] it represents resources, not just businesses but also Farms, Fleets, Forests and Mines. When held by [[The Bishop]] it represents alms and Congregations; By The [[The Mountebank]] it signifies something falsely earned, theft, or a valuable prize to be taken away, possibly as a punishment delivered by [[The Doctor]]. In the hands of [[The Witch]] the coin is sometimes a gemstone or a mana crystal, and may represent physical Mana sites or conceptual treasure such as a secret of mysteries.
