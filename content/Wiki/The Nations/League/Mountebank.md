Give me a dagger, a coinpurse and a smile, and nothing is impossible
## Overview
[[Mountebanks]] are a combination of confidence trickster and streetwise [[Magician|magician]] found in [[The League]]. Part con-artist, part street entertainer, mountebanks are street-mages with a (sometimes ill-deserved) reputation as thieves and scoundrels. Mountebanks rely on their wits, often engaging in complex scams and long-term cons against the richest and most powerful members of society. A group of mountebanks combines magical lore with a variety of other [[Skills|skills]], doing whatever works to complete their goals. Unlike many [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Groups|groups]], mountebanks often experiment with improvisation rather than relying purely on formulaic [[Rituals|rituals]], tailoring their [[Magic|magic]] to the specific situation they are in. This is expensive in terms of resources and talent, but can be very [[Rewarding|rewarding]].
Not all mountebanks belong to groups. A street-[[Mage|mage]] like this may be working alone for a variety of reasons, some of which they [[Will|will]] be unlikely to share. They may just prefer the freedom of working as and when they please, or they may be avoiding the telling of a dark secret or escaping a dark past. For whatever reason, these magicians work hand-to-mouth and alone, or very occasionally with another, though the nature of these partnerships is  transient - more often a [[Mountebank|mountebank]] [[Will|will]] team up with somebody with skill at arms, or another skill that they do not share.
Some [[Mountebank|mountebank]] covens practice a form of [[Dramaturgy]] that involves improvised, comedic or slapstick performances to mask their use of ritual [[Magic|magic]]. This practice is frowned on by the [[Troupe]] magicians of [[The League|the league]] ... which simply makes it all the more appealing to the mountebanks.
