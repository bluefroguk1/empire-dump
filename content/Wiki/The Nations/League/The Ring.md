[[The Ring|The ring]] is one of the [[Dramaturgy#The Instruments|instruments]] or [[Dramaturgy]]. As such it often represents the method used in a magical ritual. A [[Troupe|troupe]] will often have a specific prop that they use for [[The Ring|the ring]] whenever it appears, and may in time come to treat the inanimate object a little like a member of the cast.
Appearance: [[The Ring]] is the smallest of the instruments, and in order to be visible to an audience most troupes choose the flashiest and largest ring that they can. Some troupes have diamond heirlooms; some more recently founded ones make do with faceted glass and gold plate. It can also appear as a crown, a bracer, a pendant or even a mask. Outside the [[The League|League]], a gift of some sort often plays the same role as the Ring in more formal dramaturgy.
Meanings: On its own, the Ring represents loyalty and oaths, bonds and [[Groups#Bands|bands]]. Moved between two characters it often represents a transfer of power from one to the other, and is often used in bargains, deals (and geases), and in placing some [[Enchantment|enchantments]].
When used by [[The Captain]], the ring signifies oaths that are upheld, and the bonds between a [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. In the hands of [[The Prince]], it stands for the covenant between ruler and subject, and for rituals that create such bonds, or which transfer things from one person to another (it may be used for [[Thief's Arcane Gambit]] for example). When held by [[The Bishop]] it represents oaths of faith, often the vows taken by priests, [[Groups#Sects|sects]] or magic that draws power from emotions or by simulating virtues. For [[The Mountebank]] it may signify a broken or false oath, which means it has resonance with a [[Curse]] that is delivered to someone for a past action, or it may be hidden to conceal a bond. With [[The Doctor]] it is used with magic that follows or exposes bonds or the influence of outside forces. With [[The Witch]] it is most often a symbol of [[Groups#Covens|covens]] or things that connect two people (such as [[Fan the Flame of New Life]]).
