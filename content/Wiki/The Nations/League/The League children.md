The arrival of a child in a [[Family|family]] is a time for great celebration and as a result, for the first few years of their lives, [[Children|children]] are feted, celebrated and looked after by their [[Family|family]] and older siblings; in the more affluent sections of society they are often bedecked in finery and brought out on show at balls and public [[Events|events]]. While infants in [[League]] cities are treasured and cooed over, and every babe [[Will|will]] have a dozen adopted aunts or uncles, older children are very much treated like miniature adults. Smart youngsters in League cities are apprenticed early and expected to learn the basics of how to thrive in League society. 
Apprenticeship is very important in League cities. One [[Will|will]] see young people in livery serving at the tables of a [[Merchant Prince]] or working as guides and messengers. It is expected that education [[Will|will]] come as part of one’s apprenticeship. The master one works for [[Will|will]] also be responsible for teaching letters and numbers, or arranging tuition. In return, the child is expected to earn their keep. It is understood that [[League Children|League children]] must be kept busy; else they turn to the fine League tradition of Making Trouble. 
The Church of [[The Little Mother|the Little Mother]] is famed for drawing its members from the orphans of [[War|war]] who might otherwise be reduced to begging on the streets. The Church [[Will|will]] take in children whose parents have been killed on the borders or at sea, offering apprenticeship. Many influential leaders of [[The League|the League]] began as orphans in the care of [[The Little Mother|the Little Mother]].
