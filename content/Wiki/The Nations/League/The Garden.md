[[The Garden|The garden]] is a place where fertility and healing occur; the forest is where the untamed wilderness confuses and sometimes destroys the protagonists.

When it is the forest, untamed and wild, it is a setting for rituals that unleash or destroy - whether that is the unleashing of primal emotions or fears as in [[Dreamscape of the Endless Hunt]] or [[Unfettered Anarchy]], or the power of nature itself in [[Thunderous Deluge]] or [[Thunderous Tread of the Trees]]
