[[The Garden]] is a throne, a location used in [[Dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a [[Realm]] of [[Magic]].
Realm: Spring.
Setting: The garden becomes a Forest when it represents a wild natural environment. Sometimes there is a combination of the two - the Forest of Verdigan that appears in several of the plays of the mater playwright Heywel de [[Tassato]] represents the tamed hunting preserve as well as the dangerous areas where wild beasts well. The garden is a place where fertility and Healing occur; the forest is where the untamed wilderness confuses and sometimes destroys the protagonists.
Characters: [[The Captain]] and [[The Mountebank]] are strong characters in this setting. The Captain overcomes Challenges, and gains strength by doing so. or has his wounds healed bu [[The Witch]] or occasionally The [[The Bishop]]. The [[Mountebank]] lies in wait, or unleashes destructive forces that ultimately overwhelm her.
Magical Style: This is a place of primal power. When it is the garden, representing primal powers harnessed to human will, it is a setting for healing and Empowerment [[Rituals]] such as The [[Hands of Sacred Life]] or [[Vitality of Rushing Water]]. When it is the forest, untamed and wild, it is a setting for rituals that unleash or destroy - whether that is the unleashing of primal emotions or fears as in [[Dreamscape of the Endless Hunt]] or [[Unfettered Anarchy]], or the power of nature itself in [[Thunderous Deluge]] or [[Thunderous Tread of the Trees]]
