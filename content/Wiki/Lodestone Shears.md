## Description
These tools allow an [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] to extend their ability to deal with the bonds that all enchanted items require. They most often take the form of a small pair of shears, scissors or snips, depending on the materials the artisan works with. Some traditional crafters - especially in [[Wintermark]], [[Varushka]] and among the [[Navarr]] - favour rune-carved blades, with which they inflict a tiny nick on a person whose bond they are severing. Often a little of the blood is used to sketch the rune [[Evrom]] on the item, assuming both owner and item are present. 

Whatever form they take, lodestone shears are usually made of heavy metal and generally marked with the [[Evrom|Rune of Ending]].

## Rules

* Requirements: You need the [[Crafting_skills#Artisan|Artisan]] skill to bond to this item.
* Effect: If you have the [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] skill, you may use these shears twice per day to cut a bond connecting to any item you can make as if you were casting the [[create bond]] spell.
* Materials: Crafting Lodestone Shears requires seven measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]] and six ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
