## Description
This six-foot spear is usually made of blackened ash-wood, with an orichalcum-iron alloy head, generally shaped like a leaf, and kept at razor sharpness. They were popular with the [[Varushka history|Vard]], and used extensively during their conquest of the land that is now Varushka. The spear has largely fallen out of use, but it is still popular in some of the more isolated vales where warriors armed with a Razorleaf Hasta and a round shield support heavily armoured [[Varushka military concerns|schlacta]] in defending their homes against certain [[Varushkan Monster#Wolves|monstrous threats]], especially husks.

Beyond Varushka, the spear is used by many [[Navarr]] [[Brands|brands]] who are not also warriors, and by some [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[Highguard military concerns|cataphracts]] who still practice an adapted form of the [[Weapons & armour#One-handed Spear|one-handed spear]] and [[Weapons & armour#Shields|shield]] fighting style their ancestors used from [[Horse|horseback]].

## Rules
