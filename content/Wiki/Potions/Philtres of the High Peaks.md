It should come as little surprise that the [[Philtres of the High Peaks]] were first codified by the [[Urizen]], but the original recipes themselves date back to the time of Terunael. The Urizen refined and developed them over the course of several centuries, improving their potency and efficiency, and by the time they joined [[The Empire]] the preparations were in the form they exist today.
These Potions restore personal mana. They will not give a character personal mana if they do not already possess it, and they will not raise personal mana above the maximum set by Skills and crafted items.
## Mageblood
This thick red liquid Visibly contains finely-chopped particulate and has a slightly salty taste; all factors that contribute to its common name. The fact that the philtre has proved to be most popular with Magicians who focus on Healing spells has only helped to reinforce this naming convention, to the point where the original Urizen name - ''The Philtre of Celestial Excellence'' has fallen out of use except among the most traditionally minded.
* Form: Philtre.
* Description: This red liquid contains tiny particles of pale material suspended within it. It is very thick, and smells faintly of copper. A tiny droplet on your tongue reveals it to have a surprisingly salty flavour.
* Roleplaying Effects: You feel an urge to gaze in wonder at the world around you for a few moments.
* Mechanical Effects: You regain up to 2 points of spent personal mana. If you do not have personal mana, the preparation has no effect.
* Recipe: one dram True Vervain and one dram [[Imperial Roseweald]].
## The Philtre of Heavenly Lore
This startling violet elixir is likened in Urizen poetry to the sky at night. Some metaphorically minded apothecaries - especially in [[The Brass Coast]] and [[The League]] - include tiny shavings of pure gold, silver or platinum as part of their brewing process to enhance this stellar connection. Doing so achieves little more than raising the price of the resulting mixture, however.
* Form: Philtre.
* Description: This thin liquid has a startlingly violet hue. It smells faintly medicinal, like cough syrup. A tiny droplet of this oily fluid on your tongue reveals it to have a tangy, citrus flavour.
* Roleplaying Effects: You feel a strong urge to gather magical power, items and knowledge.
* Mechanical Effects: You regain up to 6 points of personal mana. If you do not have personal mana, this preparation has no effect.
* Recipe: Two drams each of Imperial Roseweald and [[Bladeroot]], and one dram of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]].
## The Elixir of Empyrean Art
This silvery elixir is effervescent, and may sparkle occasionally when exposed to natural light. It is quite rare and much sought after. The apothecary dissolves a small amount of the star metal [[Ilium]] in a potent Herbal solvent that is then stabilized with Cerulean Mazzarine. The greater the store of personal mana possessed by the magician who drinks it, the more powerful the effect.
The first elixir of Empyrean art was given as gift by Callidius of WealDawn in an attempt to secure the affections of Tybalt of Magvillius. Their slow, fifteen year courtship during which the pair exchanged clever gifts at each equinox and solstice is still a subject for the restrained romantic poetry of the Urizen. At the wedding, Callidius made a gift of the secret of preparing this [[Potion]] to each of the assembled guests, an act of [[Wisdom]] and [[Prosperity]] that, after his death, led to calls for him to be recognised as an exemplar.
Some circumstantial evidence exists to suggest this elixir is addictive. The ingredients themselves have no such properties, but the well-read physick Noach von [[Holberg]] suggested that the desire to drink more elixir came from the magician, not the potion itself. To date, few magicians have been rich enough to afford enough draughts of the elixir for this craving - if it exists - to become a problem.
* Form: Liquid.
* Description: This silvery liquid is filled with tiny bubbles. If you shake the container it effervesces energetically and seems to sparkle like polished glass. It has no aroma but tasting it makes your tongue tingle almost expectantly.
* Roleplaying Effects: You are filled with almost painful amounts of magical power. As long as you have personal mana remaining, you feel a strong urge to perform [[Magic]] as often as possible. When the effects wear off, you feel a vague urge to sample them again.
* Mechanical Effects: You regain all your spent personal mana, and gain an additional 2 points of temporary personal mana. These temporary points are the first ones spent when you spend personal mana. If you have not used these temporary points within half an hour, they are lost. If you do not have personal mana, this preparation has no effect.
* Recipe: Three drams of Bladeroot, two drams each of Imperial Roseweald and Cerulean Mazzarine, one dram of True Vervain and a single ring of Ilium.
## Tisane of the Stuttering Fool
This pale green, mildly narcotic liquid is sometimes called ''[[Thresher]]'s Tea.'' It depletes the personal mana reserves of a magician who drinks it leaving them unable to cast spells. It can sometimes be given to a magician unaWares, but is more often fed to them directly as part of a punishment - it is common to give this herbal tea to a criminal who might possess dangerous magical powers.
* Form: Liquid.
* Description: This pale green liquid clings viscously to the inside of the container when you shake it. It smells strongly of spice and summer flowers. A droplet on your finger or tongue causes the tip to tingle, almost expectantly.
* Roleplaying Effects: You are confused, unable to concentrate properly or focus your thoughts for at least the next ten minutes.
* Mechanical Effects: If you have any personal mana, you immediately lose it all. You can regain personal mana normally. 
* Recipe:  Two drams of Cerulean Mazzarine and one dram each of [[Marrowort]] and True Vervain.
