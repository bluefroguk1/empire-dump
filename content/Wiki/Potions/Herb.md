## Overview
There are five potent [[Herbs|herbs]] that are common throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]]. These herbs are infused with [[Magic|magic]] which allows them to be used by a skilled [[Physick|physick]] to cure a range of ailments.
An [[Apothecary]] can instead use herbs to brew a [[Potion]], which can then be used by anyone who is not dying on zero hits.
Many other herbs exist in [[The Empire|the Empire]] setting. A small number have magical properties (such as [[Realmsroot]]) but for the most part these herbs exist below the [[Abstraction|abstraction]] layer. While they may have useful qualities, but they are not used in the creation of potions or the treatment of conditions. Examples include the contraceptive plant bitterweed, the [[Herb|herb]] used to allow a person to change their gender expression, tobacco, tea, and the many plants with minor narcotic or medicinal effects such as those found in the marshes of [[Kallavesa]]. Players are free (within reason) to create and talk about these minor herbs as they see fit, as long as they understand that they remain below the [[Abstraction|abstraction]] layer and [[Will|will]] not have an impact on [[The game|the game]].
## Rules
*You can only use the magical effects of a [[Herb|herb]] if you have physick skill
*It requires 30 seconds of [[Appropriate roleplaying|appropriate roleplaying]] to use a [[Herb|herb]]
*The [[Herb|herb]] use fails if you or your target are hit or attack another character during application, but the [[Herb|herb]] is not consumed
*Any character who has a [[Herb garden]] receives new herbs after each [[Downtime|downtime]]
*You cannot use a herb without a suitable card ''and'' phys-rep present
There are five common herbs in [[The Empire|the Empire]]; it is possible for [[Fleet]] owners to purchase them from [[Foreign ports|foreign ports]] but most Imperial herbs are grown in a [[Herb garden]]. A character who owns a [[Herb garden|herb garden]] [[Will|will]] receive 14 herbs from their [[Resource|resource]] in their [[Downtime]].
Although herbs have powerful healing properties, they require skill to apply. They can only be applied by a character that has the physick skill, usually as part of some appropriate medical roleplaying.
Herbs are indicated by a small card (85mm x 55mm), printed by Profound Decisions, that indicates the presence of the herb and includes the rules for using the herb. You must provide a phys-reps for any herbs that your character owns, and the cards should be kept with the phys-reps, otherwise you cannot use the herbs in game and should not carry the cards on your person.
An appropriate phys-rep for a herb is a small vial of liquid, or a pile of herbs, leaves or pieces of plant matter. You can also focus on phys-repping a suitable container for the herbs instead if you prefer.
In addition to the five potent herbs there are a number of less common herbs like [[Realmsroot]]. These herbs are hard to cultivate and often lack the power or flexibility of the five most useful herbs. These rare herbs use a [[Potion|potion]] lammy rather than a card - it is not possible to be certain what they do until they are used.
