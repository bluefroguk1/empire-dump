Following the of the 380YE Autumn Equniox, and the [[Peace_song|events]] that preceded it, Lady Tamain Sepulchre composed this song to assist in pushing back against the insidious heralds of [[Lashonar]].
This has been adapted by Tegwen Hammersley from Eileen Óg/The Pride of Petravore, the original tune can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqGwm0CC0Wo here].
A recording of this song will be uploaded as soon as possible


Dawnish knights, and Yeofolk and Weavers, 
In the Way, I’m sure you’re all believers,
But these birds will trick you, they’re deceivers, 
For they are the Heralds of Lashonar.
They work for a fickle Eternal,
Strive to do its deeds infernal, 
And their words will put your soul in peril, 
For they are the Heralds of Lashonar.

You may cry, and mourn for those you’ve lost, 
But your love is gone, their sacrifice the cost, 
And the Empire’s wars, they are still there to be won
So don’t listen to the Heralds of Lashonar. 

Courage bids us stand against our Foe, 
Wisdom states, “To War we must Go!”
To these calls for peace we say no! 
Say no to the Heralds of Lashonar.
Ambition means that we will win this War,
Our Prosperity is what it’s for. 
Our Empire, it always will need more, 
But it doesn’t need the Heralds of Lashonar. 

Chorus

In this Barrens War Pride we find, 
And we stand with Loyalty behind, 
For these Druj no treaty will yet bind, 
All despite the Heralds of Lashonar.
In the East we fight with Vigilance, 
Come, my friends, and join with your Lance, 
So together take up this dance, 
All to spite the Heralds of Lashonar. 

Chorus
