## Description
Goldwood Pipes allow a priest to use a musical performance to draw on the power of the [[Auras of Wisdom#Consecration|consecration]] of [[Wisdom]] to revitalise the spirit of their audience. The profound sense of possibility - of the ability to overcome any challenge with the right questions - fills the spirit of the audience and leaves them revitalised and ready for anything. The power of the magical musical instrument itself is only part of the process that brings about this spiritual experience - the performance itself helps connect the spirit of the audience with the power of the potent consecrated aura. 

A set of Goldwood Pipes may be any type of musical instrument, but are most often it is a soft or quiet woodwind instrument. They take their common name from the [[materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] varnish with which they are finished, It is common for a magical musical instrument of this type to be decorated with koans, parables or wise sayings. Some artisans believe [[Wisdom]] is represented by [[Irremais]], Rune of Wisdom, and this [[Runes|rune]] is often worked into the instrument in some way. In [[Varushka]] - where they are quite popular - these instruments are often called ''Squirrel Pipes'' or ''Spider Pipes'' and bear likenesses of those [[Varushka_religious_beliefs#The_Virtuous_Animals|virtuous animals]]. The [[Navarr]] call them ''Gildenwood Pipes'' and swear that the best examples are made with wood harvested from the golden trees of [[Miaren]]. 

Like may ceremonial items, Goldwood Pipes are often [[Hallow|hallowed]]. The [[Auras of Wisdom#Hallowing of Avigliana|Hallowing of Avigliana]] is particularly popular - a "captive audience" is an excellent opportunity to spread ideas and share knowledge with others. When using the instrument a priest will often intersperse their performance with a few carefully chosen readings, typically short sections from the lives of the [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of Wisdom, which further help to inspire their audience.
