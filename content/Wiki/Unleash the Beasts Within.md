InterdictionWhile [[Agramant]] is subject to the [[Amity and enmity#Enmity|enmity]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]], it is illegal to perform this ritual.
## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
  The performance requires the invocation of Agramant by at least three of his commonly-known names.

 
### Effects
The military unit gains a significant bonus to its effectiveness when it is [[Military_unit#Support_Army|assigned]] to support a [[Imperial army|campaign army]]. 

While it is under this enchantment, the character who controls the target resource experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]; You have a strong sense of your own entitlement; you should be free to do whatever you want in pursuit of your goals. Those who allow fear of the law, or the bonds of tradition, to prevent them from achieving their ambitions are fools. Those who actively try to prevent you realising your destiny should be destroyed utterly, and without mercy. 

  If the military unit does not support an army during the next downtime, the ritual has no effect.
## Assurance
This ritual permanently losing power if every military unit in the Empire is ever disbanded.
## Description
The warriors who are part of a warband [[enchantment|enchanted]] with this ritual find it easy to inflict pain, and experience heightened aggression. The more bloodthirsty they are, the more the magic drawn from Agramant encourages them and strengthens them. It encourages the members of the a warband to deal with problems directly, with violence, and their willingness to fight without any restraint - to "get stuck in" - will take many opponents by surprise. The effect of the magic is very clearly turned outwards; those affected will rarely mourn a comrade who dies fighting but they will not turn on each other. They are united in their desire to kill, to take what they deserve, and to fulfil their destiny at the expense of their enemies.

''Unleash the Beasts Within'' [[Shake it off#Bad_Lore_and_Black_Drops|entered Urizen lore]] shortly before the Winter Solstice 384YE, as part of a book entitled ''Ceremonies of the Black Drop Society''. The attendants of the [[Phaleron|Great Library]] were deeply uncomfortable with the rituals in that book and their presence among Urizen lore, more due to their illegal nature than any sentimental concerns about their origin. They were apparently all submitted at the same time as [[Treacher's Quill]], but Phaleron itself intervened to delay their appearance in lore while it pondered how best to respond. In the end it decided to do the only reasonable thing; present the rituals to the Urizen as part of their lore as agreed when the lore was established. The Celestial Library does not enjoy causing trouble for its Urizeni allies, but the [[Gift of Knowledge]] is available to every Imperial citizen; it cannot pick and choose who can contribute rituals via the ritual.

## Common Elements
The ritual fills a fighting force with both cruelty and bloodlust. Ritual performances often include the evocation of [[Naeve|the rune of hunger]] or the constellation of [[The Claw]]. Blood is often shed during this ritual, often mixed with a cup or bowl of water or spirits and drunk by the targets. Sometimes the ritual involves the targets cutting themselves with a blade and swearing oaths to kill any who would stand in their way. There are often invocations of wolves or other predatory animals, especially [[Mundane beasts#Dire Beasts|dire beasts]]  and occasionally [[Legendary beasts#Manticore|manticores]] during the performance of ''Unleash the Beasts Within''.
