__NOTOC__
## Overview
The Churnspire Adjutor is an [[Urizen]] [[Imperial title]] [[384YE_Spring_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Construct_Churnspire|commissioned]] during the Spring Equinox 384YE. The initial plans for the Churnspire were [[The_Net_of_the_Realms#A_Spire_for_Summer|provided]] by Megaris of Glowspire.

## Responsibilities
The Churnspire Adjutor has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a set of regalia each year, and a bounty of golden apples each season from [[Meraud]]. If the Churnspire were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Adjutor to deal with those threats.

## Powers
### Gift of the Enchanter
The Adjutor gains custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. They receive an income of two [[Vis#Golden_Apples|golden apples]] each season as a gift from Meraud.

### Regalia of the Adjutor
The Churnspire Adjutor receives a set of regalia from the ''Golden Magician'' in the form of the Tempestuous Orb, the Staff of Storms, and the Mask of the Geyser. The regalia is imbued by Meraud just before each Summer Solstice. The regalia is legally the property of the Churnspire Adjutor. If the Adjutor were to step down or be revoked then the items should be given to the new Adjutor with all appropriate haste.
## Appointment
The Churnspire Adjutor is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] [[senator|senators]] during the Summer Solstice. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.

The title can be held by any Urizen citizen. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Urizen [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].



## Churnspire
The Churnspire was built with a solid foundation of [[white granite]], and the spire towers over the Churn, one of the most volatile geysers located in Peregro. The spire is largely dedicated to luxurious apartments for the Adjutor with art depicting a great tower looming over a shrouded lake common throughout. A small turret projects out and overlooks the geyser. The only way to access the turret is through a corridor inlaid with [[mithril]] which glistens during the hours of twilight.
