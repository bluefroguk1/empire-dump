__NOTOC__
Our true nationality is humankind. 
## Overview
[[Lineage]] is common in [[Urizen]]. The Urizen philosophers were the first to study and codify [[The Way]] lineage may be passed on through bloodlines, and to describe the effects of [[Eternal]] supernatural influence on humans. They also have a great deal of interest in ways that eternal influence manifests in other species.
## Specific Lineage
A number of [[Merrow]] who live in Urizen were born in [[The Brass Coast]]. The Freeborn see the calm nature of the Merrow is being at odds with their way of life and it is true that merrow rarely find themselves comfortable in Freeborn society. Many Freeborn parents of a merrow child will take that child across the bay to Urizen, where the child will find a better life.
Only the [[Briar]] lineage is not well represented in Urizen. The instinctual attitudes of the Spring lineage sit poorly with many Urizen. It is not the superstitions about sinister Spring influence that concern many Urizen, but what they see as a built-in anti-intellectualism. That said, there are a number who have made a name for themselves as Sentinels. The instinct of the briar to take direct, straightforWard routes around problems helps them to focus their attention on the pursuit of physical, rather than purely mental, excellence.
The stubborn will of the [[Cambion]] Lineage has recently proved to provide a measure of protection from the oppressive atmosphere that dominates [[Spiral]]. As such, Urizen cambions are increasingly in demand as messengers between the spires of the south-eastern Territory and are often sought out to perform scouting, support, or rescue missions there, although the very quality that makes them so useful also means they tend to be frustratingly intractable and prone to embarking on unrelated side quests that they have decided are more important
## Orcs
Urizen does not have a great store of knowledge about the non-human species, and there is consequently a national fascination with thinking creatures from outside [[The Empire]], including orcs. When The Senate voted to allow the [[Imperial Orcs]] to become part of the Empire the Urizen Senators spent hours debating with other senators. At the end of this period they agreed among themselves with a two-to-one majority that the orcs were civilized creatures who would improve the Empire. The dissenting [[Senator]] made a dire prediction that the Imperial Orcs could do irreparable daMage to the Empire, but thus far there are no signs of this outcome happening.
