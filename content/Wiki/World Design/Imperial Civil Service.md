The Civil Service shall serve [[The Throne]] and the people, and be bound in oaths of [[Loyalty]] to [[The Empire]]. They will be civil in their dealings and treat each citizen by their virtues, without prejudice or favour regardless of wealth, nationality or title. They will choose amongst them those who will serve as magistrates, to ensure the law is a friend to no-one but instead the servant and the master of all.
__TOC__
## Overview
The [[Imperial Civil Service]] was established at the birth of the Empire but the roles and responsibilities were not codified until later, during the reign of [[Emperor Giovanni]]. Every member of the Service swears an oath to carry out their duties honestly and without favour to any party. As such, they do not vote in any elections, allowing citizens to trust the information and advice they provide is as fair and accurate as possible.
The civil servants who attend [[Anvil]] are Generally based at the Civil Service Hub, located roughly at the centre of Anvil. However, their work takes them across various parts of Anvil, as is outlined here.
All civil servants are NPC only positions. Their role is to enable the game to run effectively - providing dependable sources of information and preventing players from being bogged down in administration or bureaucracy. The roles are intended to be incorruptible, so that players can trust what the information implicitly. Profound Decisions will ''never'' run plot in Empire involving the corruption of magistrates or other civil servants.
## Institutional Civil Servants
These civil servants are responsible for the smooth operation of a specific Imperial Institution. In all cases a single specific title exists, linked to each of the five great houses of the Empire, e.g. the [[Speaker for the Senate]]. Though such offices are always referred to in the singular, in practice there are usually multiple civil servants assigned specific to each role.
### Speaker for the Senate
The Speaker for the Senate comprises those civil servants appointed to oversee the business of the [[Imperial Senate]].  The Speaker chairs all sessions of the Senate to ensure they are orderly, timely and effective. They are responsible for accepting motions from Senators and creating the agenda for each session, including any addresses that are to be made.
The Speaker is the best in-character point of contact for queries about [[Senate Motions]], Commissions, creation of New [[New Imperial titles]], and advice on how the Senate is run.
The office of Speaker is expected to maintain the following records:
* A list of all motions brought before Senate, the wording, their proposers, and the seconders.
* Whether or not each motion was passed, failed or withdrawn.
* Any disbursement from the [[Imperial treasury]] that was approved for the motion.
* A list of all announcements made before Senate.
* The location of a suitable [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lYOkBmRhK_7uDKhEHO6b10opGSok9THZ/view a suitable pro-forma for Senate motions.]

## Non-Institutional Civil Servants
A number of key Civil Service roles are not tied to a single official body of state. These positions are responsible for providing advice and service across multiple different houses or directly to individual citizens.
### Constitutional Court
The Constitutional Court is a body of civil servants whose job is to ensure that the motions passed by the Imperial Senate can be implemented in accordance with the [[Imperial Constitution]]. The Court provides [[Scrutiny]] of every motion after it passes the Imperial Senate, checking that it is in accordance with the Imperial Constitution and that it can be effectively implemented by the Civil Service. It exists to allow Profound Decisions to check that any motion that changes [[The Way]] Empire plays will not adversely affect the enjoyment of the game in the years to come. 
Members of the Court will attempt to provide constitutional advice to any citizen who requests it, to give citizens the best chance of ensuring that anys motion presented to the Senate are legitimate. However, advice given by any individual member is not considered binding by the Court, and all Senate motions are subject to further scrutiny once they have been passed on the floor of the Senate.
Some members of the Court have a number of their own responsibilities. The Auditor of the Imperial Treasury is responsible for providing funds disbursed from the Imperial treasury by the Senate and producing the accounts for the [[Master of the Imperial Mint]] each summit. The Imperial Archivist is responsible for historial research and for all Civil Service publications, while the Chief Magistrate is the senior magistrate for The Empire. These Civil Servants sometimes attend sessions of the Senate to provide important further context on the opportunities and powers available to it.

### Secretariat of the Civil Service
The Secretariat are responsible for recruitment and appointment of new civil servants, as well as the day-to-day operation of the Service. Citizens who have an issue with the behaviour of a civil servant are best advised to raise the matter with a member of the Secretariat who will try to assist. At Anvil, when not facilitating the needs of the Civil Service as a whole, they usually fill other roles in line with their specialisms.
At present the two members of the Secretariat are the Secretary [[General]] who directly oversees all civil service operations and the Cultural Liaison, who works directly with the [[Egregores]] of each nation whole to ensure that all Imperial citizens, especially those new to Anvil, have access to the support they need.

### OverSeer of [[Imperial Elections]]
The Overseer of Imperial Elections is responsible for administering the appointment for all Imperial titles not managed by another office of the Civil Service, and ensuring all elections adhere to the strictures of [[Imperial Law]]. This includes, but is not limited to, elections for senators and generals each summit.
The Overseer can be approached with any query regarding elections to the Senate, Military Council or Bourse. Appointments by the Imperial Synod are best directed to the Tribute of the Synod. Appointments by the Conclave are the remit of the Prefect of the Conclave, (Merlot, the current Overseer of Elections is also a Prefect of the Conclave).  
The Overseer is expected to keep the following records:
* The list of current [[Imperial Title]] holders
* The list of titles awaiting election
* All elections ''to'' the Senate or appointments ''by'' the Senate
* Results of appointments ''to'' or ''by'' the Military Council

### Imperial Magistracy
Magistrates are responsible for enforcing Imperial Law. They appoint members of the militia and coordinate their activities, directing them to investigate potential crimes that have been reported. They administer trials, overseeing the proceedings and determining the verdict and setting the punishment. They oversee executions, as well as the collection and redistribution of fines.
Magistrates can be be approached to provide advice on any aspect of Imperial Law, as well as to offer advice on how to bring a civil claim. They are currently based at the magistrate's office, near the Hub. 
The Chief Magistrate oversees the magistrate and is responsible for appointing and promoting new magistrates. The Constitutional Court always includes the Chief Magistrate and the longest serving magistrate, so the Chief Magistrate can also provide constitutional advice.
The Magistracy, especially the Chief Magistrate, are also responsible for assisting in the creation of Imperial Favours.
The Magistracy publishes the Court Report following each summit that details all trials and their outcome.

### Division for the Preparation of True Liao
These civil servants take instruction from those individuals awarded or in possession of True Liao. Where individuals seek to use the True Liao to have visions of their past lives, it is the responsibility of these civil servants to interview them, to explain the process, and then to administer to the ceremony after the True Liao has been suitably prepared.
They aim to make themselves available to all potential visionaries for interviews and discussions at the Hub - both on the Saturday night of each summit as well as at 1:30pm on the Sunday.
These civil servants are also responsible for keeping records of which citizens are due to receive visions of their past lives, which are published in the Hub. The Civil Service does not record the details of previous Visions - the responsibility for this lies with the [[Seer of the Gateway]].

### [[War]] Scouts & Prognosticators
Imperial war scouts provide vital intelligence to the Military Council on the disposition and movement of enemy forces. This information is combined with divinations performed by the Imperial prognosticators to identify [[Conjunctions]] of the [[Sentinel Gate]]. Each summit, the department produces a set of briefings for the Council, detailing all major conjunctions that have been identified, along with objectives and potential outcomes.
The prognosticators and war scouts also work together to produce briefings for the smaller military conjunctions that are published before each summit. In consultation with the Constitutional Court, they decide which Imperial title should be given dominion over the conjunction. The war scouts are the best people to talk to if you have any questions about a military conjunction. At Anvil, the war scouts maintain a post near [[The Sentinel]] Gate in order to advise on known Conjunctions. 
The Imperial Archives also employ numerous prognosticators to help create the [[Winds of Fortune]], the accurate forecasts and reports which are published before each summit.
