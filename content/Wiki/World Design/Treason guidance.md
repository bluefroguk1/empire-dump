## Legal treatment of dealings with eternals
When a citizen is accused of committing treason with an [[Eternal|eternal]] (or herald) it is not uncommon for there to be little evidence of what actually transpired. Consequently [[Magistrates|magistrates]] follow some simple guidelines.
If magistrates have satisfactory evidence regarding an interaction between a citizen and an [[Eternal|eternal]] (or herald) then they [[Will|will]] judge that evidence to determine if treason was committed or not.
If there is no satisfactory evidence (because it was a secret meeting or similar) then if the meeting was with an [[Eternal|eternal]] under amity or neutral then (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) the magistrates [[Will|will]] presume everything was above board.
However, if the meeting was with an [[Eternal|eternal]] under enmity then:
*for an [[Archmage|archmage]] (or similar titleholder) interacting with their [[Realm|realm]] of responsibility the magistrates [[Will|will]] presume that they were just doing their job; but
*the magistrates may draw an adverse inference against anyone else. If so this is likely to lead to a [[Conviction|conviction]] for treason.
