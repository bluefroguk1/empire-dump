## Overview
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the [[Freeborn]] have a relaxed attitude to those with [[Lineage]], with two notable exceptions.
## [[Cambion]]
Cambions have a special place in Freeborn society, a tradition that dates back to the murky prehistory of the Freeborn. According to legend, a particularly clever [[Cambion|cambion]] (whose origin is usually tied to the teller in some way) convinced the founders to sign a cleverly worded trade agreement. This binding oath is allegedly what has kept the Freeborn together as a people. This story has created a superstition that the blood of a [[Cambion|cambion]] (usually a thumbprint) upon a document of trade [[Will|will]] bring good fortune to the signatories. As a result, Freeborn [[Cambion|cambion]] often study to become scriveners.
## [[Merrow]]
The calm nature of the [[Merrow|merrow]] is at odds with the fiery Freeborn way of life. [[Merrow]] rarely find themselves comfortable in Freeborn society and there are few to be found. Many Freeborn parents of a [[Merrow|merrow]] child [[Will|will]] take that child to a [[Spire|spire]] in [[Urizen]], where the child [[Will|will]] find a better life - indeed such a stipulation is often explicit in the parts of a marriage contract dealing with [[Children|children]]. There is no shame in this; the Freeborn recognise that a [[Merrow|merrow]] [[Will|will]] struggle to find a life in the tribes and encourage the parents to make a decision that is seen as being in the best interests of the child. The parting song [[Without You]] is traditionally associated with this custom.
## Orcs
The Freeborn [[Emperor Ahraz]] i Contero i [[Guerra]] freed the [[Imperial Orcs]] slaves and was instrumental in bringing them into [[The Empire|the Empire]]. As a people, the Freeborn have a great deal of time for the [[Imperial Orcs]], encouraging them to make a place for themselves. On the whole, the Freeborn prefer to deal with people honestly - whatever they may look like - and consequently they are amongst the folk most likely to treat a non-human individual as an equal.
