Heroes are not born. They are forged in the fires of experience, and tempered in the waters of wisdom. It is my duty and my honour to help forge the heroes of tomorrow.
## Overview
[[The Academy]] is an in-character school run by NPCs which focuses on providing activities for young role-players. It aims to give them a fun and interesting role-playing experience while also helping them learn about the game world and, of course, how to play the game. The sessions provided by [[The Academy|the Academy]] cover as far as possible all aspects of the game, including [[Combat]], [[Magic]], [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|alchemy]], [[Surgical skills#Physick|physick]], and the [[The Way|virtues]]. In addition [[The Academy|the Academy]] provides "field trips" and other adventures for its students.
Our aim is to prepare young role-players to be fully-fledged characters in the game, which can be achieved by them passing their [[Test of Citizenship]]. The Academy has a prize-giving at the end of each event to reward students for their hard work!
### IC History
The Imperial Academy at Anvil is an educational institution which is concerned with training the next generation of Imperial heroes. They are overseen by the [[Morrow#Canterspire|Canterspire]] Academy in Urizen, whose Chancellor acts as its administrative and academic leader. Although the core members of the Faculty used to be Urizen scholars from Canterspire, they employ teachers from many other nations, and have a notable relationship with a number of Navarr stridings, whose view of the [[Navarr culture and customs#The Great Dance|Great Dance]] resonates with the Academy's mission of bringing future heroes to their full potential. The Academy offers free tuition to any Imperial child.
In the Autumn of 380YE, the [[Urizen|Urizeni]] Abronsius Eldenheart stepped down from the position of Chancellor, and was succeeded by Zemira of Reumah's Redoubt from [[Highguard]], signalling a bold new era for the Academy. In the Autumn of 382YE howeveer the Academy was forced to take the sad decision to leave their offices at Canterspire and relocate to the heart of the Empire to stay safe from the [[Druj]] invasion. New Academy buildings near the Castle of Thorns have already been secured, and most of the staff have begun to settle in [[Dawn]]. Lady Jaycinda Griffinsbane, the Chancellor of the Academy expressed regret that it has come to this, but even before the Druj invasion there had been talk of transferring the heart of the Academy to somewhere closer to the middle of the Empire. With barbarians within a few weeks march of the spire, the safety of their charges forced the issue.
The Academy sees 384 looking towards a new future in Dawn, and the prospect of bold new adventures with new students and teachers alike. Lord Florette Griffinsbane stepped in for a year to manage the Academy but has now passed the leadership of the Academy fully to Chancellor Hildebrand Von Holberg of the Temple of Nine Fingers.
## Attendance

* Children cannot be left at the academy unattended
As the Academy is run by volunteer NPC crew, they cannot be left ''in loco parentis'' at any time. Children attending the Academy must be accompanied by an appropriate parent/ guardian at all times; this is for the safety and protection of both the Academy crew and the children. For age specific rules all parents are to be familiar with the following links. https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Children#Age_specific_information 
## Academy Staff
The Academy is run by a core team of NPCs known as the Faculty. These are dedicated members of crew who are entirely focused on helping young players integrate into the game while providing fun and often challenging activities.

A full list of the current Faculty is given below.  To contact the academy, email academy@profounddecisions.co.uk - the staff listed are crew.

### Fri Evening
* 1800 - Parent's Evening
* 1900 - 2030 - Tests of Citizenship & Arms.
### Sat Morning
* 1000 - 1200 - Arts & Crafts (I, Empress Mariika, extend my patronage to the Academy at Canterspire in Urizen, in recognition of the work undertaken by them to preparate and educate the children of all nations of our great Empire.
To ensure the future greatness of the Empire the best of all the Empire's children must be afforded instruction unparalleled in the Way, the arts of war, the weaving of magics, the grimnir's craft and all other such disciplines as are required to produce generations of heroes to defend this land. With this endowment, the Academy at Canterspire shall be ready to meet this challenge.
To the most civil servants of the Throne I give encouragement to seek out the best of the Academy's teachers and accept them as your own that they might administer the [[Test of Citizenship]], so that future leaders of the Empire may commence their service to the Empire as soon as they are fit to be called Citizens.
Let all the citizens of this Empire hear my words and render to this Acamdey what aid they have within their means, that it might prosper. 
Let all those who teach here do so in the knowledge that their work will secure the centuries to come.
