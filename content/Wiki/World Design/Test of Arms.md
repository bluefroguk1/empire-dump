## Overview
The [[Test of Arms]] is an Imperial test administered by members of [[The Academy]]. A child who passes the test is considered to be competent and safe enough to [[Fight]] on [[The Battlefield]] in defence of [[The Empire]]. It consists of a period of LRP fighting and questions from staff members to asses a child's fighting competency and safety. Like the [[Test of Citizenship]] the Test is administered by the civil servants in The Academy.
### OOC
In order to fight in any battle, skirmish, or quest not specifically run for younger role-players by The Academy, any player under the age of 16 must first pass the Test of Arms. The test provides a [[Basic]] check whether a young player has the mental and physical maturity to cope with the excitement and risks of the battlefield. We also check that the parent or guardian has a good understanding of what is involved and is happy for their child to participate fUlly.
## Requirements
* The parent or guardian must be present throughout the Test of Arms.
* The parent or guardian must register with the Academy staff their young players intent to take the test, and the parent/guardians understanding of the risks attending the battlefield. This should be at the beginnning of the event.
* Candidates should participate in a fight training session at the Academy before they complete their test. This increases the chance of passing the test and allows academy staff to see if a candidate is ready.
* The absolute minimum age at which any child can take the Test of Arms is 14, but some players may not be ready until they have had some experience with LRP fighting. This age limit is chosen to ensure that young players have the physical maturity to cope with impacts from adults on the battlefield and to ensure that they are seen by other participants as teenagers rather than children. 
* The Academy staff will adVise potential candidates as to whether they think they are ready to take the test.
It is recomMended that the Test of Citizenship is taken before the Test of Arms, to ensure young players have access to [[Skills]] and abilities. 
## Assessment
The Test of Arms will consist of the following parts:
# A verbal discussion with The Academy Staff to confirm the young player understands the Safety and Combat rules.
# A short practical fighting period to show the young player can fight safely. This includes: pulling their blows and engaging respectfully and safely with an opponent.
# A group combat to demonstrate a young players ability to handle a larger fight without becoming overwhelmed or unsafe.
## Timings
The Test of Arms will take place on Friday at 1900-2000 during [[Events]] that are still light by 2000. They will also take place every event from 1300-1400 on Saturday. The test takes 60 minutes. Potential candidates should have existing combat experience of LRP; otherwise they are asked to spend more time at Academy's combat sessions over the weekend before they are ready to take the test.
## Benefits
Once a candidate has passed the Test, they will receive the following benefits:
* They may take part in any battles, skirmishes, or quests that their character is able to go on.
* Any young player that passes their Test of Arms must comply with the [[Empire rules]] on monstering battles..
