## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

 

### Effects

The target may call [[Calls#IMPALE|IMPALE]] once per day with a [[Weapons & armour#Two-handed weapons|two-handed weapon]].



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Every two additional characters increases the magnitude by 5. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This [[enchantment]] is among one of the best-known Summer rituals. Along with [[Swift Leaping Hare]], [[The Swan's Cruel Wing]] and [[Strength of the Bull]] it provides a [[Groups#Covens|coven]] with the ability to select the right enchantment to enhance any band of warriors. In this case, it allows those who wield  [[Weapons & armour#Two-handed weapons|great weapons]] to strike a single devastating blow that will potentially maim or completely incapacitate an opponent. In [[Wintermark]], in keeping with the naming strategy of the other similar rituals, it is known as ''Mammoth's Thunder''; the rest of the Empire tends to use the more common name.

## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their great weapon. A ritualist might trace matching runes on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. A toast is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. Legendary warriors, especially those known for their strength or uncompromising nature, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 

Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Summer runes]] might be evoked, but [[Verys]], the rune of strength, is the most common (although the ill-favoured [[Mawrig|rune of storms]] may be used by especially war-like magicians). An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of bears, bulls and other powerful creatures such as lions and mammoths.
