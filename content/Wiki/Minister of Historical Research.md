## Overview
The Minister of Historical Research is an [[Imperial title]] appointed by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]]. It was established by [[Create title of Minister of Historical Research|majority vote of the Senate in Autumn 377]] to help the Senate handle requests for [[historical research]]. Prior to the Spring Equinox 384YE, two other titles (the [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] and the [[Imperial Advisor for the Feni]]) also had the power to commission [[historical research]]. Their powers [[385YE_Spring_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Amend_Historical_Research|were removed]] following [[A_long_December#Hold_On_To_These_Moments|changes]] to how the [[Historical_research#The_Department_of_Historical_Research|Department]] was organised. The Minister is now the only title able to instruct the Department to perform research on their behalf.

## Responsibilities
The purpose of the Minister is to authorise research requests, freeing the [[Imperial Senate]] from the need to assess each request directly.

## Power
### Historical Research
The Minister has the power to announce [[historical research]] requests. The civil service is able to process just one research request each season - research requests authorized by the Senate or the Minister all count against this limit. 

To use this power, the Minister provides an [[Senate_announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the [[Imperial Senate]]. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Minister. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[veto]] over the Minister's decision.

## Appointment
The Minister of Historical Research is an Imperial position [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#Imperial_Position|appointed by the Senate]]. Any Imperial citizen can hold this title. The Minister serves for a year, and they can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]] and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
