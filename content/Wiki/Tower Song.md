Original tune from the Forth Bridge round, words by Daisy Abbott and Chris Edwards.



I am a merchant prince* of Catazar,
Better than the other ones by far!
With every single coin I ever made,
I try to put the others in the shade

I built a tower in the sky
I buit a tower so high
I built a tower taller than the rest
To show who's best

When I climbed to the top of my tower so fine
I saw another tower slightly taller than mine
Next to the others mine looked so small
So I'll tear it down and built it twice as tall!

(ruder alt last two lines for adults:
A tower of such girth made mine look so slight
So I'll tear it down and build it twice the height!)


 * can replace with "clever mage", "mountebank" etc.
