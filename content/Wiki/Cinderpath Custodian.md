## Overview
The history of the Cinderpath Exchange is convoluted. First [[Construct Cinderpath Exchange|raised]] by the senator for [[Necropolis]] during the Summer Solstice 382YE then [[Construct Cinderpath Exchange II|raised]] by the senator for [[Bastion]] at the Spring Equinox 383YE. They were eventually [[commission|commissioned]] by an [[Construct_Cinderpath_Exchange_III|announcement]] from the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] at the Spring Equinox 383YE, and work was completed shortly before the start of the Summer Solstice of the same year. 

## Responsibilities
The Cinderpath Custodian is responsible for ensuring good relations with the Highborn who offer their white granite in trade. If the Cinderpath Exchange were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Custodian to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[opportunity]] were to arise related to the Cinderpath Exchange, the Custodian would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.

## Powers
### Ministry

White Granite
72 crowns3 wains of white granite
144 crowns6 wains of white granite
216 crowns9 wains of white granite
288 crowns12 wains of white granite
360 crowns15 wains of white granite

As a [[ministry]], the Custodian can purchase quantities of white granite at a set price. The Custodian spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice. The Cinderpath Custodian is appointed by citizens of Highguard who control [[congregation]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the congregation an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a Highborn citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
