__NOTOC__
Motion: Under the premise that the Imperial Constitution is not intended to disadvantage the Empire, this motion creates the Senate power of Escalation.
When an election is announced in Senate, the proposing Senator may call for escalation, the motion will subsequently become a Constitutional motion and the election will be immediately triggered.
Any senator on the senate floor may propose a candidate (including in absentia), however for a candidate to be appointed they just receive the support of a constitutional majority (including ratification from the Throne.)
Should no candidates be elected, a new motion to appoint would need to be submitted.Proposed Weirwater, seconded Morrow.
