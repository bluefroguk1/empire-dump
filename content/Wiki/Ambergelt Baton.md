## Description
These sturdy wands are usually made of a stout wooden core, wound about with weltsilver wire and tipped at the base with a shaped piece of ambergelt. They often bear one or more of the runes [[Rhyv]], [[Cavul]] or occasionally [[Xun]].

The Ambergelt Baton is a valuable emergency healing tool valuable both to dedicated magician healers, and to battle magicians of all sorts. It does not require extensive knowledge of healing incantations to provide powerful medical aid on a battlefield. A number of combat magicians wield a mundane rod but have an ambergelt baton as a support implement, drawing it out when they need to heal a critically wounded ally - or recover quickly from a particularly vicious engagement. Their usefulness has meant that some magicians simply call them the ''Lifesaver'', and in some circles even an expended ambergelt baton is considered lucky.

Since 377YE, the [[warmage]] has been entrusted with Merel's Rod of Healing, an [[Ilium#Creating_Artefacts|artefact]] ambergelt baton. The rod was made by Merel Pathfinder, with [[ilium]] provided by the [[Imperial Conclave]]. The warmage may wield the rod themselves, but the intention was that it could be allocated to a worthy individual each day to ensure it saved the most lives possible.

## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you may cast [[heal]], [[purify]] and [[restore limb]] on the target simultaneously as if you know them without spending any mana.
* Materials: Crafting an ambergelt baton requires seven measures of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]], four ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]] and three measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.


"It seems we arrived too late, Magister" muttered the civil servant to the cowled and robed woman at his side, "There's no way he'll survive the trip back to a surgeon in this state".  

"Perhaps, and then again, perhaps not," she replied, her voice betraying no emotion.

Pulling back her white hood she crouched down over the ravaged figure at their feet. Reaching into a hidden pocket she drew forth a varnished wooden rod decorated with intricate silver scrollwork and laid it against the fallen man's chest. Closing her eyes, she exhaled and began to speak slow, precise words of magic. After a moment, there was a catch and she felt the power being drawn out of her like air from a bellows, fanning up the flickering embers of life in the broken figure before her.  

With a grisly crunch the shattered bones of his leg began to grind together, the gaping claw wounds began to close over and a snaking rope of damp guts coiled back into his innards like worms.  Droplets of black fluid began to bubble and leak from the bite marks on his neck, dripping onto the grass where they began to steam and burn the soil bare.  Feeling somewhat drained, she slowly rose to her feet again as the man on the ground regained consciousness with a scream and curled into a ball, rocking gently.  

Smiling with satisfaction, she gestured to the civil servant. 

"You see?  Hale enough to travel now."  

The civil servant nodded, brought forth a scroll and began to read.

"Gaius Thuron Harkaysis, you are hereby charged with betraying the Empire, and with trafficking with forbidden Eternals.  You are ordered to surrender yourself to the Inquisition..."
