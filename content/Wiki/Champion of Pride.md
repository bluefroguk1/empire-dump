## Overview
The Champion of Pride is an [[Imperial title]] that was [[383YE_Winter_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Create titles of Champions of Virtue|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 383YE. The title confers custodianship of the [[Magic_items#Artefacts|artifact]] [[Pilgrim's Shield]] known as ''Ajax''.

## Responsibilities
The Champion of Pride is intended to serve as an inspiration to the Pilgrims of the faith and laity as to what it means to be proud, particularly in a military context. They are also charged with bearing and protecting the shield known as ''Ajax''. Historically the bearers of ''Ajax'' formed, along with the bearers of the other Pilgrims shield, the “Seven Pilgrims” band. 

## Powers
### Regalia of the Champion of Pride
The Champion of Pride bears ''Ajax'', the unique Pilgrim's Shield. If the Champion of Pride loses their position, then the item must be given to the new Champion with all haste. The Champion is encouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe, and is expected to do everything within their power to recover it if it is lost.

''Ajax'' was recovered by Imperial heroes at some point in 384YE, and was formally vested as regalia by the then-Champion, Lady Kaywenn de Orzel, at the Winter Solstice 384YE.

## Appointment
The Champion of Pride is chosen every Winter Solstice by a [[judgement]] of [[appointment]] by the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Assembly of Pride]].

Any Imperial citizen may hold this title. They can be revoked by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Pride Assembly, and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].



## History
The shield ''Ajax'' was created by Ezkiah the Benefactor, greatest smith of the [[Highguard|Highborn]] along with six other shields. Each was gifted to a different hero, forming a company known as the “Seven Pilgrims”. 

''Ajax'' was first carried by Sir Hugh Brocking (also known as the Peacock of Astolat), a Dawnish poet, author and swordsman. Passed from Champion to Champion, or selected by the priests of Pride when this was not possible, it remained an enduring inspiration to the faithful of the Empire. 

At the battle of [[Reikos]] in 367 YE the Seven Pilgrims of the day charged an entire [[Druj]] army on their own, allowing the outmatched Imperial forces time to quit the field in good order. ''Ajax'' was lost along with the other six shields.

Historically the Shield was passed from Champion to Champion; the Synod has ended this tradition through the creation of a formal title, following the example set by the [[Create_title_Champion_of_Courage|creation]] of the [[Champion of Courage]].
