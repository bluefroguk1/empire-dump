## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  

 

### Effects

The target may call [[Calls#CLEAVE|cleave]] once per day with any [[Weapons_%26_armour#Weapons|melee weapon]] except a [[Weapons & armour#Pike|pike]].



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Every two additional characters increases the magnitude by 5. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This [[enchantment]] is among one of the best-known Summer rituals. Along with [[Swift Leaping Hare]], [[Hammer of Thunder]] and [[Strength of the Bull]] it provides a [[Groups#Covens|coven]] with the ability to select the right enchantment to enhance any band of warriors.

''The Swan's Cruel Wing'' is also known as ''The Hungry Blade'' (or axe, or what-have-you), or ''The Dolorous Blow''. It has several advantages over other enchantments of Summer because almost anyone can benefit from it; there is no requirement to have mastered a specific weapon to strike a devastating blow.

## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching runes on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. A toast is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought and triumphed against great odds, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 

Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Summer runes]] might be evoked, but [[Tykonus]], the rune of victory, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of horses, [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]] and [[Legendary beasts#Dragons, Wyverns and Wyrms|dragons]].
