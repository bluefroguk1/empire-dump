Words and music by Jude




A year since the Thane last strode to battle
Since last his axe and armour rattled
When he slaughtered the settlers and stole their cattle

That night they drank in the Thane's mead hall
While the shadows stretched outside the wall
And the land turned white from the swift snowfall 

 A black-cloaked Scop at the door came knocking
From out of the dark where the ghosts were walking
He muted their mirth and silenced their talking 

Then spoke the Thane in his cloak of sable 
'What gift do you bring me, to eat at my table?
To feast by my fire and to sleep in the stable?'

'Here is the gift that I trade for your favour-
A pouch of salt I bring you to savour
That your bread rises well and your meat has flavour'

The thane bade him sit by the blazing fire
And eat and drink all he could desire
And the Scop sang soft and he strummed his lyre

The Thane drank deep till the dawn was breaking
His swordsmen snored as the crows were waking
But he drank with a thirst that there was no slaking

Then up rose the Scop from the hearthstone, crying:
'There on the field you left me lying
Down in the dirt with the dead and dying 

'Hear now the song I come to play you
A curse of salt I bring to slay you 
For you killed my kin and I will repay you

'Salt for a thirst that's never slowing
Salt for the earth that will brook no growing
Till the winter wind over your bones is blowing'

A year gone past since the great Thane's falling
And his hall's a ruin where the rats come crawling
Lost to the snow, and the grey gulls' calling
