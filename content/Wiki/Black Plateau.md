A song written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach after the first skirmish to the , Spiral, in YE377.


Through the gate and here we go,
Up, up to the ,
With courage and pride to face the foe,
High up on the .

There is a place in Urizen fair,
Up, up to the ,
Where whispering voices fill the air,
Those who tread should tread with care,
Don’t trust what you hear on the air,
High up on the .

Gathered people, wild and cruel,
Up, up on the ,
They’ll laugh in your face as they run you through,
High up on the .

There is a place in Urizen bold,
Up, up on the ,
Where wild men worship something old,
The sight of it will leave you cold,
They’ll take your blood to feed its soul,
High up on the .

Blades of venom, blades of glass,
Up, up to the ,
Will stop you if you try to pass,
High up on the .

There is a place in Urizen high, 
Up, up to the ,
Where they’ve got blades to warp your mind, 
An anger unknown to our kind,
Don’t lash out or get left behind,
High up on the . 

Through the gate and here we go,
Up, up to the ,
With courage and pride to face the foe,
High up on the .
