## Overview
The Blackroot Broker is an [[Imperial title]]  awarded to a [[Navarr]] citizen. It was [[Construct_venom_brokerage|commissioned]] in Spring 382YE by order of the [[Imperial Senate]], and completed shortly before the Summer Solstice. The [[opportunity]] to construct the brokerage arose as a result of a [[Start_a_fire#The_Brokers_of_Navarr|meeting of brokers]] in [[Miaren]] following [[382YE_Spring_Equinox_winds_of_war#Immolation_.28Liathaven.29|successes]] fighting the [[vallorn]] of [[Liathaven]].

## Responsibilities
The Broker is expected to gather tools for fighting the vallorn not only from Navarr apothecaries and artisans, but also from crafters across the Empire. How these tools are deployed is at the discretion of the Broker but it is assumed at least some will be made available to those directly opposing the vallorn's wickedness. The brokerage allows the Broker to purchase herbs to combat [[Vallorn#Vallorn_Miasma|vallorn miasma]] and [[Vallornspawn_husk#Green_Lung|green lung]], [[Legacy_of_Thorns#Oil_of_Blackthorn|blade venom]] inimical to many vallorn creatures, and [[Scorpion's Sting]] daggers whose powers are likewise lethal to creatures such as the [[vallornspawn husk]].

As a [[ministry]], the title of Blackroot Broker allows the holder to purchase specific potions, herbs, and venomous daggers at a set price. The Broker makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

The brokerage is designed to provide several items specifically of use to those fighting the vallorn. As a consequence, the Broker has not one but ''three'' streams from which they can purchase goods. The Broker can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 7 crowns on herbs, and 17 crowns on potions, and none of the other.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice by unanimous decision of the [[Senator|senators]] of [[Navarr]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.

The title can be held by a Navarr citizen. The Broker is appointed annually. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Navarr [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Honest Twyll's Gardening Supplies
This unassuming appearing brokerage is found near the large [[steading]] of Holt in [[Miaren#Holtford|Holtford]]. It purportedly sells a wide variety of gardening and agricultural supplies, but it also serves as a centre of commerce for Navarr [[Navarr_economic_interests#Brokers|brokers]] who deal in herbs, potions, and weapons against the vallorn.
