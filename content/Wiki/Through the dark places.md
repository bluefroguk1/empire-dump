Song by Gerwyn Walters  (link to come) 

Chords: Dm C - Dm, F A, Dm C - Dm, F A - Dm


Through the Dark Places ''- A song of the Navarr''
''Written sometime between 3-17 YE''
''Author - Unknown''
 
Through the dark places we onward roam  
bearing the beacon that shines the way home  
for gone are the houses and gone are the halls  
gone are the ancients at Terunael's fall
 
Chorus
through the dark places, through this long night
through the dark forest, we bear this light
for though all around us, the Vallorn do swarm
through our blood and our oaths, the Empire was born
 
Highguard
Through the dark places where the orcs lay
bearing the truth that will open The Way
walking the roads, from chapter to hold
We carry her message, so it may be told
 
Varushka
Through dark Varushka and into the Vales
We carry the promise that they would prevail
we'll vanquish the Sovereigns, we'll slaughter their kin
This was the promise that brought the Vales in
 
Brass Coast
Through the dark places and onto the bay
we danced with the Freeborn to start the parley
The price at the table was bitter and red
for Freeborn freedom the Navarri bled
 
Dawn
Through the dark places, where knightly they rest
we met a young serpent and joined in her quest
we conquered the rapids and filled them with stone
and with but one leap, She had won a new home
 
Marches
Through the dark places we joined the Parade
and walked with the Marchers to the home they had made
Through the trod that we crafted, the land was renewed
so The Way that we traveled, the Marchers walked too.
 
Wintermark
Through the dark places, to the north we had came
and witnessed the Thunder, the Wind and the Rain
through vinum's offspring, heroes were reborn
The Winterfolk were no longer forlorn
 
The League
Through the dark places, near rivers long
We Sang for Aldones and Danced to his song
there the three people, as one they were cast
and eight became one for they were the last
 
Through the dark places, through this long night
we gathered the people, all bearing this light
And where they had gathered, the oaths there were sworn
Through Navarri Wisdom, the Empire was born
 
Through Navarri Wisdom, the Empire was born
