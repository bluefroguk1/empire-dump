## Description
A Bishop's Chalice most often takes the form of an ornate goblet, although versions in the shape of bowls or basins are not uncommon. Regardless of the precise shape, it is generally kept full of liquid - purified water, fruit juice, and spirits are all popular choices. It can be used by a priest familiar with the ceremony of [[Religious skills#Dedication|dedication]] to reach out to members of their [[Bands#Sects|sect]] and inspire them with a renewed sense of purpose. In the process of invoking a Bishop's Chalice, both the priest and the members of the sect must be in a [[consecration|consecrated]] area. In places such as [[Casinea#Anvil|Anvil]] the Chalice is typically kept in a carefully consecrated shrine, sometimes on open display and sometimes secured in a [[Rules_update_2016#Boxes_and_Chains|locked chest]]. During use, the Chalice is used as part of a sermon - and indeed many sects use their Bishop's Chalice in ''all'' ceremonies, especially ceremonies of [[anointing]].

This [[magic items|item]] obviously takes its name from [[the League]], where it is associated with both wealthy sects and religiously-minded [[Free company|Free Companies]]. The other nations tend to have their own names for this reliquary, such as the ''Stormcrow's Bowl'' in [[Wintermark]] or the ''Troubadour's Goblet'' in [[Dawn]], or a ''Font of Purity'' in [[Highguard]] where it often takes the form of a shallow bowl used for ceremonial [[Highguard_culture_and_customs#Washing_and_cleanliness|washing]]. Not all nations are equally likely to craft this item in the form of a cup, however. In [[Urizen]] an ''Illuminated Flame'' more commonly takes the form of a brazier or lantern in which an eternal flame or beautifully crafted lightstone burns eternally. In [[Varushka]], the reliquary is much more likely to take the form of a sculpture or triptych representing [[Varushka_religious_beliefs#The_Virtuous_Animals|virtuous animals]] of particular significance to the sect which is used to illustrate parables and stories told during religious services.

## Rules

* Effect: If a member of the [[Bands#Sect|sect]] with the [[Religious skills#Dedication|dedication]] skill uses this reliquary in a [[consecration|consecrated]] area as part of a religious ceremony then after ten minutes of appropriate religious [[appropriate roleplaying|roleplaying]] any member of the [[Bands#Sects|sect]] who was present throughout may regain all their spent [[Heroic skills#Hero|hero points]]. You may only gain this benefit once per day - any additional uses of a Bishop's Chalice after the first have no affect on you. This ability cannot be used on a battlefield or in a similar stressful environment. You cannot benefit from this item if you are under an effect that prevents recovery of hero points overnight (such as [[Dreamscape of the Endless Hunt]] and similar curses).
* Materials: Crafting a Bishop's Chalice requires seven ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], five ingots of [[materials#Green Iron|green iron]], and nine measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
