### Overview
This adaptable army attracts many [[The Marches military concerns#Beaters|beaters]] who support a solid core of [[Upwold]] soldiers and a small cadre of dedicated battlefield magicians. They are skilled skirmish fighters, able to quickly learn the lay of the land and [[Army qualities#Relentless|relentless in their pursuit]] of their enemies. Some of the best military archers in the Empire are part of the [[Bounders]] adept at bringing down their opponents with a combination of clever placement and withering storms of arrows. They are also adept scouts and trackers - unsurprising perhaps given the number of [[#Beaters|beaters]] who serve or have served under their banner. Since the Spring of 383YE, they have focused their efforts on [[Army qualities#Watchful|guarding the borders]] of the Empire.

The third Marcher General leads the Bounders army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Autumn equinox each year.
