__NOTOC__
Using the powers of the Arcane Architect, I am intending to construct a summer mana sinecure in Reikos. It is a self-funded, highly efficient sinecure.''Raised by the Arcane Architect''
## Overview
* The [[Arcane Architect]] used their power to [[Arcane_Architect#Commission_construction_of_mana_structures|commission mana structures]] to announce this construction.
## Date
* Spring 382YE
## Cost
* Unknown
## Progress
* 3 white granite, 3 weirwood and 12 crowns provided by Vittore after the Summer Solstice 382YE.

## Campaign Outcome
* When completed, this [[sinecure]] will create an [[Imperial title]]. 
* The Arcane Architect will need to provide additional [[Commission#Necessary_Details|necessary details]] about the commission including the region where it well be located and the method of appointing the associated title.
## Constitution
* When complete the sinecure will create a title [[Keeper of the Cox]].
* It is not possible to create a sinecure that produces [[vis]] without an appropriate [[opportunity]]; it is assumed that the Arcane Architect is in possession of such a thing.
* The strict wording of the [[Arcane_Architect#Powers|powers]] of the Arcane Architect suggested that they could commission ''structures that will produce crystal mana.'' Summer vis is not crystal mana; the Constitutional Court sought the guidance of the Imperial Senate on whether they intended to allow structures that produce vis to be included in the Architect's remit, and the Senators confirmed that they did.
