__NOTOC__
Humans of the Mourn (excluding the Feni) are hereby afforded full protection under law.
Proposed by Mitwold, Seconded by Morrow.

### Overview
* Passed

### Date
* Summer 381YE

### Campaign Outcome
* Humans of the Mourn who are not Feni will receive legal protection as if they were a [[Imperial_Law_Overview|foreigner.]]

### Constitution
* It is noted by the court that there are a number of humans fighting for the Jotun in the Mourn. This causes a legal contradiction in that those with whom the Empire is at war ordinarily have no [[Imperial_Law_Overview|legal protection]]. In practice if humans line up in battle against the Empire imperial soldiers will normally be protected by the law of self-defence. However it should be noted that this defence involves a "reasonableness" test which now potentially places the conduct of soldiers under the scrutiny of the magistrates. Furthermore there may be other, far less clear cut, situations that may arise during the Mourn campaign.
*The use of the phrase "Humans of the Mourn" means that barbarian humans whose homes are outside the Mourn wouldn't be given legal protection but humans living in the Mourn would (even if they were outside of the Mourn).
