* [https://soundcloud.com/christopher-clarke-580791164/hear-it-in-the-stilling-bird?fbclid=IwAR0FgnRbPRWZjLC_xo564Hd3B3LhKfjDCqOcr4UEOMLuoXSavLE60pm2Lc0| We can smell your fear] on Soundcloud, performed by Chris Clarke


Hear it in the stilling bird song
Taste it in the air
Druj are here to take your homeland
WE CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR

Latch your doors and hide your cattle
Keep your windows barred
Soon the Druj will be upon you 
Soon life will be hard
Hold your children close and whisper comforts in their ear
Druj are here to make some orphans
WE CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR

Send them off
Pretend theyâ€™re safe
But when we come for them
Your body's left behind
But they will see your face again
Cry yourself to sleep
Because you know that we are near
Druj are here to go a-slaving
WE CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR

Cast away all hope and pride 
Scream and cry and curse
You'll envy soon the dead my dear
The living have it worse
Keep a ready watch
When it is getting dark and drear
Druj are here by night a-raiding
WE CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR

Jump at all the shadows
When you watch for the attack
None of it will help you
When the dagger's in your back
Fall to fitful sleep
But you shall find no comfort here
Druj are here in all your nightmares
WE CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR

We're the razor at your throat
We are your fevered dreams
We are all those come to life
It's just the way it seems
Look into our eyes
And see the blood upon our spears
Druj are here to gut the Empire
WE CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR

Run away, forget your duties
Leave your friends behind
Once we've dealt with all of them
We'll deal with you in kind
