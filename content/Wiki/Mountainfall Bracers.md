## Description
Mountainfall Bracers are usually made from sturdy material: mithril alloys, shaped pieces of natural amber, or in some cases even pieces of carefully-smoothed stone. They are usually accompanied by a set of greaves in a similar style, and a pectoral, and the whole is often decorated with ambergelt inlays. They tend to be heavy, and even a muscular magician often finds it difficult to undertake extended periods of exercise while wearing them. Many wearers complain that the mage armour becomes a little heavier every time the [[paralysis]] spell is cast with its assistance, although they clearly do not actually weigh more than they did when they were donned.

In [[Wintermark]] and the [[The Marches|Marches]], [[Wintermark magical traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]] and battle-magicians often practice fighting with heavy weights attached to their wrists and ankles to prepare themselves for using this mage armour. They also practice a discipline developed in [[Urizen]] in which they remain completely still for a short period of time and then perform a sudden action that stretches their muscles, unbalances them or the like. This technique allows a magician to take advantage of the paralysis they have inflicted on their opponent to do something surprising - to draw and strike with a sword, for example, when their enemy expects them to make another attack with their staff, or to move in an unexpected direction to keep their opponent off their guard.
