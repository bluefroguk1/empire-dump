If the Forest itself were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Dauntless Warrior to deal with those threats  - but also to deal with any opportunity to expand the sinecure, or to make any decisions about its operation.

## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Dauntless Warrior has custodianship of a sinecure and receives an income of 9 mana crystals each season.
## Appointment
The Dauntless Warrior is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[senator|senator]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.

The title can be held by a Imperial Orc citizen. The Dauntless Warrior has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Imperial Orc [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
