Written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach to commemorate the final stages of the war against the Drujj in Reikos, 379YE.


To Take High Chalcis
''By Nicassia of Phoenix Reach''

From the nations they came to reclaim the land,
All were for Reikos bound, their weapons in hand..
Lights being lit in the chapter house, felt half a world away,
Miles to go over cursed lands, all the way…

It came to a head in the red of autumn,
With rivers that ran full of a plague,
Five armies stood after months of war, at the walls of that great fort,
And their Generals swore they’d push on, all the way...

All the way to take High Chalcis
All the way to  take High Chalcis
All the way to  take  High Chalcis
All the way…

Urizen and the Marchers, Highborn and the League,
Commanded from Anvil, determined to save,
The Valiant Pegasus broke the walls, to end that foul siege, 
The four armies held and they pushed those broken gates:

Early next morning, through the clouds and the mud,
Through the Sentinel gate, the heroes came,
Ritual stones causing miasma, the targets of the fray
And for all who had suffered, the Drujj would pay,

All the way to take High Chalcis
All the way to  take High Chalcis
All the way to  take  High Chalcis
All the way…

Flags they were raised, and rituals started,
Mages all focused, soldiers kept foes at bay,
Wintermark, Highguard, Varushka, Navarr and Urizen,
Did Virtuous work in those cursed lands, all the way...

For thirteen years, the Highborn have waited,
Waited to punish the Drujj, and enter the fray,
Actions taken upon the  field, gain their just reward,
General Jericho’s orders had won the day.

All the way to take High Chalcis
All the way to  take High Chalcis
All the way to  take  High Chalcis
All the way…
