To elect a Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves
Administrative Motion 

### Overview
* First appointment of the Trade Envoy to the [[Sarcophan Delves]] after the title's creation in Winter 379Ye

### Date
* Spring 380YE

### Campaign Outcome
* Thanmir Hrafn was appointed [[Create_title_of_Trade_Envoy_to_the_Sarcophan_Delves#Constitution|Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves]].

### Constitution
* OOC Note: Parts of this section were superseded by the [[rules update 2018]].
As explained during the [[Create_title_of_Trade_Envoy_to_the_Sarcophan_Delves|creation of the title]], this title has no power to handle diplomatic relations with the Sarcophan Delves. It is a ceremonial title, with the responsibility for helping with trade with the Sarcophan Delves - it does not have legal powers. Authority to negotiate with the Sarcophan Delves continues to remain with the [[Imperial Consul]] until an [[embassy]] is built. 

Experience has shown that all attempts to initiate diplomacy with foreign nations without first building an embassy are ineffective.
