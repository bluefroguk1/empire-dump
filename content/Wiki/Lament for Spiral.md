Tune based on parts of "Dead Boy's Poem" by Nightwish. 
Words by Claire Sheridan.  [https://soundcloud.com/herecosyouare-1/lament-for-spiral Recording] 

A song written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach at the start of the interregnum. 


Lament for Spiral

So much silence, silence and darkness,
Towering spires, empty and gone,
So much to live for,
So much to die for,
To take back my heart's only home.
Exiled in Morrow, dream of tomorrow,
Destined to drown in your sorrow alone,
Winds blow through Spiral,
Reach for her Wisdom,
Fail, finding nobody.

Every tear that's silently shed,
Only strangthens our resolve,
Ankarien and sister spires,
Will again be ours to hold.

Seek out the strongholds, seek out the armies,
Scry for truth deep into the night,
So much to live for,
So much to die for,
But we will not give up the fight.
Learn all you can learn, strength lies in Wisdom,
Destined to march to my heart's only home,
WInds blow through Spiral,
Reach for her children,
Call, we will soon return. 

Every tear that's silently shed,
Only strangthens our resolve,
Ankarien and sister spires,
Will again be ours to hold.
