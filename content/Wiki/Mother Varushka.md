Mother Varushka is old as the hills
Her tears fill the streams and her sighs turn the mills
She smiles at our birth and our passing she mourns
But fools and idlers she scorns

Chorus:
Varushka, Varushka, our mother so dear
She laughs and she weeps and her anger we fear
She cradles us closer each day that we spend
And when we are gone, still our path she will tend

Mother Varushka is wise as can be
She knows what is needed for each thing to be
She melts what she can of her snow-covered shawl
To give us good food and to keep us safe all

Chorus

Mother Varushka is cunning and brave
A thousand times over, our lives she will save
Careful and wary, like the spider she spins
And watches and waits for the wolves to fall in
Chorus
Mother Varushka is loyal and true
She loves all her children, the old and the new
However she struggles neath Winter's cruel yoke
She still will defend her own brave Varushkan folk.

Chorus
