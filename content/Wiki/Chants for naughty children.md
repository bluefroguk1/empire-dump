Hey Daddy, if I'm not allowed to sing this because it's rude then why did you start laughing as soon as the lady left the tent?

There are a few children's rhymes in Dawn and The Marches that are very rude and only sung by very naughty children. Expect to get yourself and your parents in trouble if anyone catches you singing this!

To the tune of Freres Jacques.

### Dawnish version

Mucky Marcher, mucky Marcher
You're no good, you're no good
Failed your Test of Mettle, failed your Test of Mettle
Go eat mud, go eat mud!


### Marcher version

Dawnish dandy, Dawnish dandy
Run away, run away
We will do the fighting, we will do the fighting, 
While you play, while you play!


### Exceptionally Naughty Chant about the Dawnish Sung Only By Extremely Bad Children

In dawn we all get up at noon
I eat my soup with a silver spoon
When I want a cup of tea
I clap my hands and it's made for me
My seneschal's here to wash my hair
I can't go out if he's not there
He'll change my bib when there's food in it
And he wipes my arse when I take a shit
