When I first laid eyes upon her
Inez y Guerra
Golden sun was shining on her
Inez y Guerra

She was brave and she was daring, Captain of a swift corsair
Grace was in her every movement, fiery eyes and flowing hair

With the crew she'd sweat and toil
Inez y Guerra
Every one was true and loyal 
Inez y Guerra

Every word she spoke was treasure, when she smiled it brought me joy
Every soul aboard adored her, first mate down to cabin boy

Though she scorned both shield and armour
Inez y Guerra
When she fought no foe could harm her
Inez y Guerra

If I were a wealthy Captain, with a ship upon the sea
I would sail a golden galleon,'Fair Inez' her name would be

Like a ship upon the ocean 
Inez y Guerra
Beauty in her every motion
Inez y Guerra

With a hold packed full oftreasure, home upon the storm I'd ride
I would lay it at her feet if only she would be my bride

Though I never could deserve her-
Inez y Guerra
All my lifelong days I'll serve her 
Inez y Guera
