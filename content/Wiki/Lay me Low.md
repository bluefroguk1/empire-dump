Traditional / John Tams [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Gx27jRbYo youtube version]

Sheet music (arranged by Jude & Daisy, from Coope Boyes & Simpson) is [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/Lay%20Me%20Low.pdf here] (with harmonies - the melody is the middle line) or [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/Lay%20Me%20Low_noharmony.pdf here] (melody alone)

Midi: [[Media:Lay-me-low.midi]]


Lay me low, lay me low, lay me low
Where no-one can see me
Where no-one can find me
Where no-one can hurt me
 
Show me the way, help me to say
All that I need to
All that I needed you gave me
All that I wanted you made me
When I stumbled you saved me
 
Lay me low, lay me low, lay me low
Where no-one can see me
Where no-one can find me
Where no-one can hurt me
 
Throw me a line, help me to find
Something to cling to
When the loneliness haunts me
When the bitterness taunts me
When the emptiness eats me.
 
Lay me low, lay me low, lay me low
Where no-one can see me
Where no-one can find me
Where no-one can hurt me
