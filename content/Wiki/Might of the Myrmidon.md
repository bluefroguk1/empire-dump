## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

 

### Effects

The target of this ritual gains remarkable martial prowess. They gain the skills [[Combat skills#Weapon Master|weapon master]], [[Combat skills#Shield|shield]], [[Combat skills#Thrown|thrown]], [[Heroic skills#Cleaving Strike|cleaving strike]], [[Heroic skills#Mortal Blow|mortal blow]] and [[Heroic skills#Mighty Strikedown|mighty strikedown]] 

In addition, the target experiences a powerful [[roleplaying effect]]; they feel a strong urge to seek out powerful, famous and dangerous enemies and defeat them in contests of arms. They feel uncomfortable attacking from ambush or with stealth and feel much prefer to challenge their target openly before they attack. 

While under this enchantment they may respond to any roleplaying effect that would make them afraid, weary, make them doubt their abilities or coerce them into following another by loudly declaring a challenge against the source of the effect and confidently moving to attack it or engage with it. 



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 23. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This ritual [[enchantment]] empowers any warrior with great skill. It is a powerful effect that can turn provide a green recruit with the skills and knowledge of a champion. Unfortunately, it provides none of the experience that will let a target wield those skills effectively on the battlefield, nor with the heroic spark they need to get the most out of their abilities. Indeed, a target may become rash, brash and foolhardy and charge recklessly into situations where an experienced veteran would hang back.

## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching runes on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. A toast is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. The target is often garbed or [[Dawn hearth magic#Girding|girded]] in a new surcote or tabard that bears their heraldry or livery; sometimes they are symbolically crowned with a wreath of flowers, leaves or even gold. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought and triumphed over mighty opponents, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 

Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Summer runes]] might be evoked, but [[Verys]], the rune of strength, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of strong and ferocious animals such as lions, bears, [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]], [[Legendary beasts#Chimera|chimerae]] and [[Legendary beasts#Dragons, Wyverns and Wyrms|dragons]]. Any number of [[eternal|eternals]] might be mentioned, especially [[Eleonaris]] or [[Cathan Canae]],
