## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects

This ritual grants the [[Groups#Covens|coven]] that performs it the ability to perform an additional ritual each day.

The ritual counts as an [[enchantment]] on the coven (or the coven bond itself) rather than the individual ritualists.





## Description

According to scholars of Day, this ritual works by capturing the resonance of every time in the past that the [[Groups#Covens|coven]] did not perform a ritual, and every point in the future where they will not perform a ritual, and using the echoes of those moments to allow the coven to perform additional rituals ''now''. Ritualists who are part of the coven often experience strange moments of ''deja vu'', or have fleeting memories of rituals they know they did not perform but might have performed. When actually performing a ritual, these sensations become stronger - occasionally a ritualist may briefly hallucinate that they are performing a ''different'' ritual, in a different place, at a different time. These impressions are rarely overpowering, but can be unsettling the first few times they occur. 

It is worth noting that the power of this [[enchantment]] goes into effect immediately; even though the ritual is always cast using the coven bond, the ability to cast another ritual that day is available straight away.

## Common Elements
This ritual is often performed under the open sky, with as little secret as possible. Some covens choose to use a public spot, or the Anvil [[regio]], specifically to reduce the secrecy of what they are doing. The magicians often use things associated with past rituals, and it is very common for the coven to bring all of their ritual talismans along even if they are not going to use them, to encourage the connection between past, present and future rituals. For the same reason, they will often include any children who they hope will become future magicians and join the coven. Indeed, for some covens (especially [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Varushka magical traditions#Cabalists|cabalists]]) one or more of the contributors will be a youngster coached and mentored by a more powerful magician.

Symbols of doors, threshold and passages are often used; [[Urizen]] magicians may evoke images and symbols of the [[Urizen culture and customs#Net of the Heavens|net of the heavens]] while [[Navarr]] ritualists obviously make connections between the [[Navarr culture and customs#The Great Dance|great dance]] and the idea of moving the ability to do a future or past ritual to a point at which it is more useful. Some covens end the ritual back-to-back, or in groups of three, reinforcing mystic ideas of a threshold as the ever-moving ''now'' between the past (the backwards looking figure) and the future (the forwards looking figure).

The runes [[Ophis]] and [[Sular]] and [[Aesh]] are commonly invoked, as is the [[Hirmok|rune of dominion]] or the subtle rune [[Queros]] which synergises well with the subtle energies used in this magic. The constellations of [[The Key]] and [[The Lock]] are regularly used, and many covens evoke the image of [[The Door]] or [[The Three Sisters]] as well. It is not uncommon for the ritual to evoke the power of [[Legendary beasts#Sphinx|sphinxes]] who are viewed in some quarters as possessing powers to see the past or future, or to use symbols of [[Vigilance]], [[Wisdom]] or [[Ambition]].
