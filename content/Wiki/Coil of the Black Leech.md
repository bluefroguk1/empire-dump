## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must possess the [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] skill. 



### Effects

Whenever the target casts the [[weakness]] spell and strikes a target, they immediately regain up to three lost hits. The ritual does not grant the target any ability to ''cast'' the weakness spell.

While under this [[enchantment]], the target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]: whenever they gain hits due to this enchantment, they feel a rush of pleasure. Once they have used this ability once, they feel a constant urge to use it again even when they are not injured.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 14. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This vampiric ritual takes advantage of the way the [[weakness]] spell works to revitalise the caster when they strike a foe. It brings with it a dangerous, gnawing hunger to experience the pleasant taste of another's strength.  A cautionary tale suggests that the twisted, accursed leech-priests of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] were created using a variant of this ritual, or fell into the clutches of an eternal of Winter after their reliance on this magic became too pronounced.

This enchantment is sometimes coupled with the use of an [[Agramant's Bargain]] or a similarly enchanted implement. The magic also has an obvious synergy with the [[Splintering Gorget]] [[Weapons & Armour#Mage Armour|mage armour]].

## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes leeches, bats and other creatures that feed on the blood of the living. They may shed blood into a goblet of sweet wine for the target to drink or offer gifts or tokens that represent the power to take strength from others. The runes [[Kyrop]] and [[Naeve]] are commonly evoked, and some magicians favour the name of [[Agramant]] or even [[Sorin]] (whose philosophy of growth through suffering seems a peripheral match for this ritual).
