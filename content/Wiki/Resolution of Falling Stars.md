## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The ritual targets the caster only; it cannot be performed by a [[Groups#Coven|coven]].

 
### Effects
The [[enchantment]] provided by the ritual grants the caster the ability to spend a point of personal mana at any time to justify remaining calm and collected when exposed to a roleplaying effect (as if they had spent a hero point). This expenditure of mana has the same restrictions as casting a spell.

While under the effect of the enchantment the character experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]: ''you are centred and focussed and feel empowered to master your emotions rather than be mastered by them regardless of their source.''
