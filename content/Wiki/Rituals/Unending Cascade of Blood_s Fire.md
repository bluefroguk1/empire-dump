## Description
This [[Enchantment]] allows the target to scourge their enemies with [[Venom|venom]]. It can have a powerful demoralising effect on opponents, and gives a magician a potent ability to mark and then destroy their enemies. The [[Spring]] [[Eternal]] [[Arhallogen]] is known to offer magicians boons that enhance their ability to perform this ritual, encouraging them to use it to defend themselves and prove their superiority over their opponents through the use of that being's favoured tool. Indeed, [[The Spider|the Spider]] King is sometimes credited with having been involved in the development of this ritual, although it does not seem to draw directly on their power. In some circles it is called the ''Blessing of [[Arhallogen]]'' or ''Fangs of the King''. Some Dawnish [[War|war]] witches refer to the ritual as ''Donning the Spider Crown''.
The ability to refresh the use of the [[Venom|venom]] that the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] provides is particularly significant. After a battle, a magician can restore their personal reserves of [[Magic|magic]] in the restful [[Aura|aura]] of the [[Chamber of Pallas]], The [[Chamber of Delights]], or by experiencing [[Solace of Chimes]] and regain their ability to unleash magical [[Venom|venom]] at the same time. This ability can be even more powerful on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], provided the magician can make use of the rare and powerful Elixir of Empyrean Art.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes poisonous creatures or plants. Some magicians, especially [[Suaq]] icewalkers and [[Navarr]] vates, anoint the skin or weapons of the target. using blood mixed with poisonous plants or the venom of spiders, scorpions or serpents to create a thick paste reminiscent of  [[Oil of Blackthorn|oil of blackthorn]]. Other magicians invoke forces of plague, sickness and fever as they work their [[Magic|magic]], viewing the ritual as being more concerned with turning the body of the target against itself.
The performance of this ritual is often subdued. Few magicians can deny that the powers it deals with are insidious, and potentially fatal. There are few uses to which venom can be put that do not result in death, and while the poison itself may be subtle the end result is anything but.
Other elements might include the [[Runes|runes]] [[Rhyv]], [[Naeve]] or [[Kyrop]] (often accompanied by the [[Rune|rune]] of dominion; the evocation of [[The Claw]] or [[The Drowned Man]]; a scene in which a [[Potion|potion]] is used against a rival; or images of serpents, spiders, scorpions, wasps hydra, wyverns. or even chimerae.
