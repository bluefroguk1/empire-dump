## Rules
Season|Summer|100
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction 
Regio|Summer 
This ritual targets a specific region. During the performance of the ritual the casters must name a region within the target territory which has the "hills" quality.
The ritual may target a region in a territory which is under Imperial control (that is, which is eligible to appoint a Senator) when cast from the [[Regio#The Imperial Regio|Imperial regio]]. To affect a region in a territory that is not under Imperial control, the ritual must be performed at a [[Regio|regio]] within the target territory.

### Effects
The ritual targets a single region of hills or mountains within a territory. Over the course of the next few days a powerful [[Enchantment]] settles over the region which conjures a citadel of stone-hard, semi-translucent ice to offer protection to armies belonging to the force that controls the area.

## Description
This [[Enchantment]] causes a fortification formed of enchanted ice to manifest at a strategically significant location in the target region. This citadel is called forth from the frigid realm of [[Cathan Canae]], the Queen of Ice and supports the force  that controls the area. In some cases, a series of mighty towers appears instead or, more rarely, a number of vertiginous icy walls manifest at either end of an important pass.
The fortification is extremely resistant to damage; fire does not melt it and siege engines find it exceptionally hard to damage. In some cases, especially in winter, howling winds and unseasonal snowfall will assail besieging forces. These effects are irregular, but highlight the raw ferocity of the frozen north and the coldest season. The ritual is an [[Enchantment|enchantment]], and can in theory be [[Ilium#Using Ilium in Rituals|made permanent]] with [[Ilium]]. This has not been achieved in the history of the Empire, but in theory such a citadel would last until destroyed.
This ritual increases the difficulty a hostile force will have in claiming a territory, even if there is no army to oppose them directly, Local militia and the like are able to take advantage of the defensive [[Enchantment]] to hold off larger forces, at least for a time.
## Common Elements
It is common with this ritual to invoke the name of Cathan Canae, or to call on the memory of famous castle builders such as [[Semmerholm#Semmer.27s Rose|Willard d'Onnecour]] or [[The Sentinel]]. [[Dramaturgy]] involving the erection of a castle, especially on [[The Battlefield]] at the orders of [[The Captain]] might be appropriate, as might evocations of the constellation of [[The Oak]].
A map is sometimes used as an additional element, often obscured during the casting with water or exposed to snow or ice. Sometimes the map is created from sand or painstakingly drawn with salt or coloured powders as part of the ritual, reinforcing the idea of raising a magical fortification. 
The runes [[Verys]] and [[Feresh]] are commonly used during this ritual, and the constellation of [[The Oak]] is often invoked.
