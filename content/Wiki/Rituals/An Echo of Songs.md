### Effects
This ritual enchants a [[Mine|mine]]. It requires a number rings of [[Ilium|ilium]] equal to the level the [[Mine|mine]] [[Will|will]] be upgraded to (one more than the current rank of the [[Mine|mine]]). When the ritual is complete the illium is consumed and over the next few weeks the power of the [[Mine|mine]] is increased - it is permanently upgraded one level. 
The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] does not prevent a character from upgrading their mine during [[Downtime|downtime]] using the normal rules.
The owner of the mine experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]] while their mine is [[Enchanted|enchanted]]:they feel an urge to uncover secrets and delve into the real motivations behind [[Events|events]]. It is easy to become caught up in conspiratorial thinking, seeking complicated  explanations for even the most mundane event.
