## Rules
Season|Night|4
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character
This ritual is neither an [[Enchantment]] nor a [[Curse]], but rather is a ''shroud''. A given character can only be under the effect of one ''[[Secrets for the Shadow Courier]]'' at a time.
### Effects
This ritual requires a suitable bag or pouch no more than 18" deep or 6" wide. It targets a single character.
At the completion of the ritual the target character gains an item equivalent to a [[Night Pouch]] that cannot be opened by anyone save the target; the contents cannot be accessed by anyone else without ritual [[Magic|magic]] or a special ability.
The effect of the ritual lasts for a year; at the end of this time anything left in the pouch is lost in the same way as with a standard [[Night Pouch|night pouch]].
### Additional Magnitude
You may choose to create a more powerful effect, which is harder to penetrate or remove. You may increase the magnitude of the ritual by any amount.
### Options
If the ritualists include five measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] as part of the [[Cost|cost]] to perform the ritual, they can perform the ritual on a pouch up to 24" deep or up to 9" wide.
### Removing the Shroud
Any ritual that attempts to open the pouch or gain information about it or its contents must at least match the magnitude at which ''[[Secrets for the Shadow Courier]]'' was performed.
## Description
The [[Night]] Pouch spell creates a useful item, but this ritual builds on its power to create a more secure container. It is likely that this ritual represents the earliest form of [[Night Pouch|night pouch]], from which the existing spell was refined and specialised.
One of the main advantages it has over the [[Night Pouch|night pouch]] spell, beyond the difficulty of opening it, is that it can be used to create a [[Night Pouch|night pouch]] for ''anyone'', and that the pouch lasts for a full year. Another advantage, albeit a minor one, that makes the ritual appealing to others is that even the ritualists who performed ''[[Secrets for the Shadow Courier]]'' possess no special ability to open the pouch.
## Common Elements
Things that enhance themes of [[Secrecy|secrecy]], concealment and privacy are common elements with this ritual. The pouch itself is often embroidered with night [[Runes|runes]], especially [[Diras]].
