## Rules
Season|Autumn|6
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character
### Effects
This ritual allows the [[Coven]] to divine information about the bonds of a single character. It [[Will|will]] answer some or all of the following questions:
* Is this person bonded to any [[Magic Items]]? Are any of those items visible [[Right now|right now]]? Which ones are they?
* Is this person part of any [[Bands]]? Are they part of a [[Banner|banner]]? A [[Sect|sect]]? A coven? What are the names of those [[Bands|bands]]?
* Is this person an Imperial citizen? If so, which nation do they belong to?
* Is this person a creature of the [[Realms|realms]]? If so, which [[Eternal]] are they responsible to?
* Does this person bear the [[Arcane Mark]] of a [[Conclave order]]? If so, which one?
Each contributor receives the same information.
If the character is protected by a shroud, the ritual determines the [[Realm|realm]] and magnitude of that shroud. If an object or band they are bonded to is protected by a shroud of a higher magnitude than the ritual, the ritual determines no information about that object or band, beyond the fact it exists and is shrouded (along with [[Realm|realm]] and magnitude as normal) - it still provides other information about bonds that are not shrouded.
Information about the bonds of a character is always available - [[Detect Magic]] may occasionally indicate that there is some additional piece of information that could be found with this ritual.
### Additional Magnitude
You may increase the magnitude of the ritual to penetrate more powerful shrouds or masks.
## OOC Information
The target character must be present throughout but need not be a willing participant. The [[Referee|referee]] may take a moment to confirm certain information with the target. If the coven wishes to determine if a character is bonded to a specific [[Magic|magic]] item, it is a good idea to let the [[Referee|referee]] know that in advance of performing the ritual.
## Description
This divination allows the contributors to analyse the network of bonds and connections that surrounds most living beings. Bonds created by [[Magic|magic]] are easiest to divine, but there are other connections the ritual [[Will|will]] track. It can tell if someone is an Imperial citizen, for example, by divining the bonds and sympathies that define cultural identity - it can even determine which nation an Imperial citizen belongs to. It can identify a creature of the realms as distinct from a human or orc, and reveal which [[Eternal|eternal]] the herald is tied to, generally by their most commonly known name.
The ritual can also divine social connections - it can trace the delicate strands of band affiliation, revealing membership of a coven, sect, or banner and providing information about the name of that band. Likewise, it is effective at determining membership of a [[Conclave order]] - much more effectively than a mere [[Detect Magic]]; if the target belongs to an order it reveals which one, regardless of the order affiliation(s) of the contributors.
The ritual has some weaknesses, of course. If someone is not an Imperial citizen it does not provide any other information - although there are stories that similar [[Rituals|rituals]] exist in most other nations that instead provide information about the gross affiliations of their countryfolk. For example, it is widely believed that [[Barbarian|barbarian]] orc magicians can perform a version of this ritual that reveals tribal affiliation. Academic magicians theorise that the [[Rituals|rituals]] are actually the same, and it is the nature of the contributors that determines what information they receive about [[Nationality|nationality]].
[[Magic]] that misleads divination can confuse this ritual - but unless the target person is fully shrouded, it [[Will|will]] only conceal some threads from the prying gaze of the ritualists. A target's membership of a certain sect may be concealed, for example, or their tie to a certain sinister [[Magic|magic]] item shrouded by an [[Enchantment|enchantment]], but even in such cases a powerful enough performance can force its way through the shroud to reveal the connection. Incidentally, magicians practicing this ritual have reported that they most commonly encounter shrouds specifically concealing this kind of information when dealing with heralds of the [[Night Realm|Night realm]] - especially those who later prove to be associated with [[Sung]] or the [[Whisper Gallery]].
According to one apocryphal tale from the wily [[Suaq]] [[Magician|magician]] Belus Redsparrow ([[Archmage of Autumn|archmage of Autumn]] 53YE to 56YE), the ritual ''was'' cast on the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Prospero]] as the result of a certain favour being called in, and the sheer volume of information it provided proved impossible to discern in any detailed sense, and did little more than confirm that the individual the magician was dealing with ''was'' [[Prospero]], and was connected to a great number of heralds. The truth of this tale is difficult to confirm or deny.
In pre-Imperial times, the ritual was commonly used in [[Urizen]] and [[The League]], primarily for investigative purposes. In [[Urizen]] it is sometimes seen as a manifestation of the [[Net of the Heavens]], while in [[The League|the League]] (where it was coincidentally known by the same name even before the creation of [[Imperial lore]]), it is often discussed in meditations of the bonds of [[Loyalty]] and obligation that surround all civilised individuals.
## Common Elements
As a divination, runestones and cards may be employed, or the ritualists may reflect the target in a mirror or other reflective surface, or study the magical auras around them with lenses or crystals. A lone ritualist performing ''[[Ties that Bind]]'' [[Will|will]] often stare into a bowl of water, often with a golden coin at the bottom, while a practitioner of another tradition might spatter a little of the target's blood into a bowl of water, or the surface of a mirror, and study the resulting patterns.
The [[Rune|rune]] [[Queros]] is often evoked with this ritual, but the [[Lann]] rune also has some resonance. The dramaturgical personae of [[The Prince]] and [[The Doctor]] are particularly appropriate, as is the Instrument of [[The Ring]] or [[The Throne|the Throne]] of [[The Chamber]], where things are revealed. Wise totems such as sphinxes, owls, the names of paragons or exemplars of [[Loyalty]] or [[Wisdom]], and the name of the [[Eternal]] [[Prospero]] are likewise commonly evoked.
