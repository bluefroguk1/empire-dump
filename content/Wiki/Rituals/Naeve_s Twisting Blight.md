## Description
This ritual blights a territory with sickness, causing crops to wither, foodstores to become corrupted, and inflicting illness and [[General|general]] malaise on people and animals. 
## Common Elements
The ritual releases a malign, oppressive pestilence across a territory. Grim, throbbing musical rhythms, slow threatening movement and invocations of dread and hunger are all used to raise and direct this malign power. It is common to evoke the [[Rune|rune]] [[Naeve]] (obviously) and sometimes [[Kyrop]] with this ritual.
