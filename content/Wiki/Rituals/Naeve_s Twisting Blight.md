### Effects
All crops in the target territory are scoured with blights and unseasonable weather. Preserved foodstuffs are ravaged by rot and mould, and weaker animals fall sick and in some cases die. Residents of the territory often fall ill while this curse is in place. 
All Farms in the territory provide only half as much money as they would normally provide.
The additional production provided by an [[Enchantment]] such as [[Rampant Growth]] is not affected by this curse.
Season Duration
## Description
This ritual blights a territory with sickness, causing crops to wither, foodstores to become corrupted, and inflicting illness and [[General]] malaise on people and animals. 
## Common Elements
The ritual releases a malign, oppressive pestilence across a territory. Grim, throbbing Musical rhythms, slow threatening movement and invocations of dread and hunger are all used to raise and direct this malign power. It is common to evoke the rune [[Naeve]] (obviously) and sometimes [[Kyrop]] with this ritual.
