## Rules
Season|Summer|8
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2  Target Character
[[Enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains a limited ability to repair a broken item. Once per day, with five seconds of uninterrupted Appropriate roleplaying, they may repair any item, such as a weapon or shield, that has been broken using the [[Shatter]] call. The roleplaying must include touching the broken item. If the user or their target attacks another character or either of them are hit then the attempt to use this ability fails, but is not wasted.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same banner. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 6. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
A significant advantage to this ritual is that the ability it grants can be used just as effectively by a robed magician or a knight in fUll harness. It is most commonly used by wielders of pole-arms, pikes or staffs - weapons at particular risk of being shattered - and by those who rely on a shield for protection. The ritual is sometimes criticised for lacking the immediate power of a enchantments such as [[Strength of the Bull]] or Swan's Cruel Wing. However, as the [[War]]-witch Elaine de Rouillard famously said when Challenged over her support of the ritual "''a warrior without a weapon is no different to a Farmer, and a warrior without a shield is no different to a corpse''".
Most often, the ritual is performed with a specific item in mind - a Marcher yeoman who needs to keep their pike or halberd in Fighting shape, or a Highborn cataphract who relies on their shield both may [[Make good use]] of the power this ritual offers. It is often especially useful in battles against [[Jotun]] champions who often employ [[Magic]] weapons that allow them to break weapons and shields, or when fighting cunning [[Thule]] warlocks who use magic to render their foes vulnerable.
This ritual is popular in [[Dawn]], where it is sometimes combined with the practice of girding. The ritualists assist a companion in preparing for battle, and help ensure that they are not left unarmed or defenceless in the heart of the fray. It is also quite popular with the Runesmiths of [[Wintermark]] and with the blacksmiths of [[The Marches]], who often see it as a natural extension of their [[Skills]] at the forge.
## Common Elements
The [[Runes]] of [[Verys]] and [[Jotra]], steel, artisans' tools, oaths of brotherhood and [[Loyalty]]
The ritual is often performed with as specific item that is vital to the target in mind, and that item usually plays a central role in this ritual. Some magicians may even combine the performance of the ritual with the [[Create Bond]] spell or as part of a ceremony to make or reaffirm an oath of fraternity or loyalty. The runes Verys and Jotra are often used, sketched on the target characters or items, but the rune of wealth is also used, especially when the item involved is especially valuable or precious.
