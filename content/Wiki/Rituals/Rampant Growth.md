Season Duration
[[Downtime]] buff
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional forests in the same [[Territory|territory]]. Each additional [[Forest]] increases the magnitude by 8. The character who controls each [[Forest|forest]] must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This ritual is popular with the [[Navarr]], but sees use across [[The Empire|the Empire]], supplementing the special [[Materials|materials]] harvested from a [[Forest|forest]]. It unleashes a torrent of [[Spring]] energies within the [[Forest|forest]], encouraging the growth of young trees while fallen timbers quickly mulch into compost and erupt into fresh saplings. Fine wood and other luxuries harvested from the [[Enchanted|enchanted]] forest result in increased revenue for the one who controls it, and a variety of valuable healing herbs are also gathered over the coming months. 
The ritual also has positive effects on the health of many animals in the area, especially insects and similar creatures such as moths and butterflies, or the creatures that feed on them. Additional revenue might thus even come from the sale of honey, beeswax, fur or meat as well as silk, valuable plants, fruit and wood.
''[[Rampant Growth]]'' does nothing to increase the amount of the mysterious special [[Materials]] that can be gathered from a forest - [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Verdant Bounty of the Twilight Bayou]] are much more effective in that regard. Rather the ritual is designed to increase the versatility of the forests it is used to enchant, [[Rewarding|rewarding]] their owners with wealth and with new goods to use or sell.
## Common Elements
The ritual encourages hardy growth of plants. Ritual performances often include the evocation of the [[Rune|rune]] [[Bravash]] or the [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Fountain]]. Hearth magics and symbols associated with health and [[Prosperity]] are also commonly evoked, such as shedding small amounts of blood or offering a cup or bowl of wine or mead to the targets.
