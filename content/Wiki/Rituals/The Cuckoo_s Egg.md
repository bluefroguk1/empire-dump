## Rules
Season|Night|6
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must be willing. The ritual must be performed near the [[Sentinel Gate]] when it is performed in [[Anvil]], or near the [[Gate|gate]]'s return point if it is performed elsewhere.
The ritual must include giving the target a new name, appropriate to the nation of the [[Coven|coven]] performing the ritual. If the target is not of the same species as the coven performing the ritual, the target must also wear an article of clothing or marking appropriate to the coven's [[Nationality|nationality]] (a mask, a cloak, a [[Navarr]]-style symbol [[Painted|painted]] on the face and so on).
### Effects
When the ritual is complete the target may be brought through [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] Gate as if they were an Imperial citizen of the same nation as the coven who performed the ritual. They must be accompanied by at least one member of the coven performing the ritual.
The ritual allows one trip through the [[Sentinel]] Gate which must take place within ten minutes of the ritual being completed.
This ritual cannot target Imperial citizens (it cannot be used, for example, to allow players to participate in a battle their nation is not attending).
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same band. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 4. Additional [[Characters|characters]] must be present throughout, and must receive a different name.
## Description
This ritual was developed under the guidance of the Varushkan Simargl, the Empty One of the Circle of Zulgan-Tash during his [[Tenure|tenure]] as [[Dean of the Lyceum]]. A quintessentially elegant exercise in the use of the [[Magic|magic]] of [[Night]], the ritual tricks the [[Magic|magic]] of the [[Sentinel Gate]] into allowing a non-Imperial to be brought through in one direction or the other. It does not actually change the [[Nationality|nationality]] of the target - it simply creates a short-lived deceptive [[Aura|aura]] that interferes with the ability of the gate to determine the identity of the target. The ''glamour'' is very specific - while it allows someone to pass through [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] gate who could not otherwise do so, it could not be used to (for example) trick a magical ward that allows only [[Freeborn]] individuals to pass.
While the subject of the ritual must be willing, they do not have to be happy about it. A prisoner could still be subjected to this ritual provided their consent can be secured; many prisoners would consider agreeing to this ritual to be preferable to death or torment. That said, it is obvious that the ritual is more useful in rescuing foreigners from dangerous situations, or allowing them to accompany questing [[Groups|groups]] or heroic sorties alongside Imperial allies. In the latter case it must be remembered that the [[Magic|magic]] allows passage only in ''one'' direction - the ritual would need to be performed again to bring the target back through the gate.
Several scholars involved in devising the ritual have suggested that a more potent effect that functions as an [[Enchantment]] on the targets might also theoretically be possible, allowing the target to travel in both directions on more than one occasion during the duration. They also opined that a more potent version could be devised that allowed an unwilling target to be brought through the gate. It has also been pointed out that a similar effect could be achieved with relative ease using the [[Magic|magic]] of the [[Autumn]] [[Realm]], creating a similar effect to that of The [[Ambassadorial Gatekeeper]].
## Common Elements
Even though the ritual only requires ''guising'' the target if it is of a different species to the magicians performing it, it is common to include that element even when the species is the same. Another common element is the use of hearth magics related to identity such as girding, masks, mirrors, cowls and veils or donations of clothing. Similarly, symbolic ceremonies of adoption or marriage might be employed, often followed by an equally symbolic casting-out or divorce once the gate is passed. A [[Kallavesi]] involved in designing the ritual suggested that certain animal masks might also be appropriate - symbolically casting the subject as an animal companion rather than a member of the same nation.
The [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Three Sisters]] is quite appropriate to this ritual, as are the [[Runes|runes]] of mystery or plots. Dramaturgical performances using [[The Witch]], especially those involving cases of mistaken or concealed identity, are also a good fit for this magical glamour.
