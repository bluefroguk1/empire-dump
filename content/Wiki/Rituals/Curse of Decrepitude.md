[[Curse|curse]] 
### Effects
This ritual creates a [[Curse]] that is delivered to a target with a [[Curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]]: one [[Rituals#Contributors|contributors]] is chosen to deliver the [[Curse|curse]], and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the curse, the target experiences a powerful [[Roleplaying effect]]; they feel extremely aged and infirm, whatever their actual age. Physical exertion leaves them tired and out-of-breath.
In addition, while under the curse the target is under the effect of [[Calls#WEAKNESS|WEAKNESS]]. This weakness cannot be removed by any means as long as the curse remains in effect. Any resources used to try and remove the weakness are consumed without effect.

### Removing the Curse
The curse can be removed by certain powerful creatures or items. It can also be alleviated by powerful [[Rituals|rituals]] that remove curses of physical debilitation such as the "white stone" produced by [[Amalgamation of Silver and Gold]].
### OOC Elements
A [[Briar]] can use their [[Briar#Roleplaying Trappings|natural vitality]] to throw off the exhaustion that comes from physical exertion, but all the other effects apply as normal.
## Description
This dreadful curse can leave its victim utterly enervated, and provides many of the symptoms of advanced age or long sickness. A warrior can still fight, but cannot summon the strength to strike a [[Heroic skills#Mighty Strikedown|mighty blow]]. A [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] cannot manage the simplest spell, and is incapable of effectively [[Rituals#Contributors|contributing]] to a ritual. An [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] can craft beautiful items, but can barely summon the energy to use one. Exhaustion, aching joints, dimmed vision, wandering mind and many other forms of frailty become their constant companions.
## Common Elements
As with many curses this ritual often involves a recitation of the grievances against the target; sometimes flames are lit at the start of the ritual and extinguished, one by one, to represent the weakening of the target's spirit and body. Ashes and dust are another common component. The rune [[Kyrop]] is often evoked, symbolising the weakness of old age that the curse will bring, and the runes [[Irremais]] or [[Verys]] may be defaced or destroyed to represent the loss of wisdom and strength. The constellation of [[The Drowned Man]] may also be invoked; after all this ritual represents a harsh reminder of the inevitability of death for many ritualists.
