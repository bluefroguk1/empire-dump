## Rules
Season|Winter|50
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2  At the end of the ritual one of the contributors is chosen to deliver the [[Curse|curse]] with a pronouncement of doom.
[[Curse|curse]] 
### Effects
This ritual creates a [[Curse]] that is delivered to a target with a pronouncement of doom: one contributors is chosen to deliver the [[Curse|curse]], and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the [[Curse|curse]], the target experiences a powerful [[Roleplaying effect]]; they feel extremely aged and infirm, whatever their actual age. Physical exertion leaves them tired and out-of-breath.
In addition, while under the curse the target is under the effect of [[Weakness|WEAKNESS]]. This [[Weakness|weakness]] cannot be removed by any means as long as the curse remains in effect. Any resources used to try and remove the [[Weakness|weakness]] are consumed without effect.
Year Duration
### Removing the Curse
The curse can be removed by certain powerful creatures or items. It can also be alleviated by powerful [[Rituals|rituals]] that remove curses of physical debilitation such as the "white stone" produced by [[Amalgamation of Silver and Gold]].
### OOC Elements
A [[Briar]] can use their natural vitality to throw off the exhaustion that comes from physical exertion, but all the other effects apply as normal.
## Description
This dreadful curse can leave its victim utterly enervated, and provides many of the symptoms of advanced age or long sickness. A warrior can still [[Fight|fight]], but cannot summon the strength to strike a mighty blow. A [[Magician|magician]] cannot manage the simplest spell, and is incapable of effectively contributing to a ritual. An artisan can craft beautiful items, but can barely summon the energy to use one. Exhaustion, aching joints, dimmed vision, wandering mind and many other forms of frailty become their constant companions.
## Common Elements
As with many curses this ritual often involves a recitation of the grievances against the target; sometimes flames are lit at the start of the ritual and extinguished, one by one, to represent the weakening of the target's spirit and body. Ashes and dust are another common component. The [[Rune|rune]] [[Kyrop]] is often evoked, symbolising the [[Weakness|weakness]] of old age that the curse [[Will|will]] bring, and the [[Runes|runes]] [[Irremais]] or [[Verys]] may be defaced or destroyed to represent the loss of [[Wisdom|wisdom]] and strength. The [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Drowned Man]] may also be invoked; after all this ritual represents a harsh reminder of the inevitability of death for many ritualists.
