### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional forests in the same territory. Each additional forest increases the magnitude by 4. The character who controls each forest must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
The four special [[Materials]] gathered in the forests of the Empire are mysterious and complex to gather. [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|Iridescent gloaming]] can be gathered from cocoons, but they must first be located and gathered. The viscous [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] must be collected carefully from the natural production of trees which is difficult to predict. While [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]] is relatively easy to create, the beggarwood tree from which it is manufactured resists efforts at cultivation. Even more obviously, [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] must be carefully sought out where it lies beneath the soil amid the roots of trees.
All of this goes some way to explain why the magic of Night is so useful for [[Enchantment|enchanting]] the useful material production of the forest. The magic of Spring is useful for creating uncontrolled and unpredictable growth, but with the magic of Night a forest is not so much persuaded to produce extra materials, as to collaborate with the harvesters and gatherers to help lead them to valuable substances that might otherwise be lost.
The most common feature of this ritual is the manifestation of tiny fist-sized purple or light-blue lights that drift among the trees gathering in small groups around concentrations of the raw materials so valuable to Imperial [[Crafting skills#Artisans|artisans]]. By marking the locations of these 'twilight lanterns', foresters can increase their harvest of special materials without risking any damage to the forest's bounty.
This ritual takes its name from [[Therunin]], the waterlogged forest of the [[Navarr]]; the residents of that territory had been using this ritual for centuries prior to the rise of the Empire. Around the same time, the [[Wintermark Magical Traditions#Mystics|mystics]] of [[Kallavesa]] used a similar ritual they called ''Evocation of the Twilight Fireflies'' to harvest iridescent gloaming and ambergelt from the hardy trees of the swamps. The ritual is now employed across the Empire, especially in [[Varushka]], to produce large amounts of raw materials for sale to the other nations.
## Common Elements
The ritual creates often involves a map of the forest to be [[Enchantment|enchanted]]; in the case of the [[Navarr]] a map of the trods near the forest may be studied, and the shapes worked into new designs suggesting swirling tendrils extending from the trods to embrace and surround the target forest. Other common features include samples of the raw [[Materials|material]] most suited to the forests; wood, leaves or flowers taken from the forest; symbols of [[Prosperity]]; candles or other small flames reminiscent of the ''twilight lanterns'' the ritual often manifests.
Like many Night [[Rituals|rituals]], performance tends to be subtle and understated. Music and movement suggesting searching and finding is often used, and ritualists often wear long capes or cowls of silk or other valuable materials. The runes [[Wyr]] and [[Diras]] are sometimes used, and even [[Sular]] might not be inappropriate.
