### Effects
Over the coming season, the target Fortification becomes a beacon for defenders in a Territory. The garrison and any assigned [[Military unit]] become focused on identifying threats to the territory and its people, while empowering them with clarity and focus that allows them to swiftly identify hidden threats.
If there is a [[Spy network]] operating in that territory it takes significantly more effort to gain useful intelligence - the thresholds for information are increased by two-fifths. Any efforts to infiltrate the territory by a hidden force may be laid bare to [[The Empire|the Empire]] depending on the situation (may trigger a wind of fortune if such forces are present).
At the next event [[The Captain|the captain]] of any [[Military unit|military unit]] assigned to defend the fortification [[Will|will]] receive a report in their pack detailing the information their soldiers have uncovered. The report contains information about any foreign [[Spy network|spy network]] operating in the territory along with details of any enemy campaign army that undertakes an attacking order in the territory including their allegiance; an estimation of their strength; the name of their [[General|general]], and information about their special qualities.
