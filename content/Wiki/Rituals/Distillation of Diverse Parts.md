## Rules
Season|Day|4
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 The ritual targets a [[Potion|potion]] prepared by an [[Apothecary|apothecary]] which must be present throughout.
### Effects
This ritual targets a [[Potion|potion]] created by an apothecary. It renders the potion down into its component parts allowing the [[Herbs|herbs]] used to brew the potion to be recovered. This may take a short time to complete.
The ritual [[Will|will]] not recover [[Liao]] or mana crystals that have been used in a potion, although it [[Will|will]] extract a ring of [[Ilium]] that has been used in the creation of a powerful elixir.
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional potions. Each additional potion increases the magnitude by 1. Additional potions must be present throughout, but there is no requirement for them to be of the same type.
## Description
This is a relatively simple ritual that separates a potion into its various parts. In addition to the herbs that are recovered, it leaves the ritualists with neat piles of salts, mundane herbs, thimbles of water or alcohol and the like. One odd element is that the ritual always provides the herbs used in a standard recipe; it doesn't seem to matter if the apothecary who brewed the potion used an item such as an [[Escharotic Cauldron]] to substitute additional herbs.
This ritual ''can'' be used to extract the components used in a poison that has been mixed with another substance, but only if the poison has not already been ingested, and if the ritual is begun ''before'' the poison breaks down and becomes useless.
The ritual destroys a dose of [[Liao]] if there is any in the potion; the reason for this appears to be that it breaks the liao down into its component pieces along with everything else in the elixir. Likewise, it cannot return crystals of mana because they are "used up" in the creation of the potions that involve them. It ''can'' get [[Ilium|ilium]] out of a potion, however, and that rare ability makes it occasionally a very lucrative ritual indeed.
## Common Elements
This purification ritual often involves fire, but might just as easily involve lenses or mirrors used to reflect light onto the targeted potions. In some cases, the ritualists engage in procedures familiar to the herbalist, but in reverse. Repeatedly diluting and then decanting the potion, or using a process of magically-enhanced distillation may also be an element. The [[Rune|rune]] [[Cavul]] is often invoked, unsurprisingly.
