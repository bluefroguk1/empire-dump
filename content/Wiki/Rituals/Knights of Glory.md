## Rules
Season|Summer|120
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction This ritual targets an [[Imperial army]]. The [[General|general]] responsible for the army (or the [[Egregore|egregore]] if the [[General|general]] is not at [[Anvil]]) must be present throughout.
Regio|Summer 
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual summons a number of warriors from the [[Summer]] [[Realm|realm]] to support a campaign army. The presence of these supernatural warriors [[Will|will]] raise the strength of the campaign army by the equivalent of 2,000 additional soldiers. Army Strength Ritual
While the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] is in place the general of the army experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: ''You are confident you can face and overcome any [[Challenge|challenge]], no matter how daunting. When someone advises caution or [[Restraint|restraint]], it is difficult not to view that as a [[Challenge|challenge]] and double-down on your glorious course of action.''  
The ritual draws warriors from the [[Realm|realm]] of [[Eleonaris]]. These heralds have been known to exert unpredictable influence those fighting alongside them, especially those with the [[Changeling]] [[Lineage]]. Past effects have included lingering [[Roleplaying effects|roleplaying effects]] or temporary hero points for the captains of military units supporting the [[Enchanted|enchanted]] army. Such effects are unpredictable; when they occur they are described in the appropriate Winds of [[War]].
Season Duration
### Assurance
The ritual loses all power and becomes useless if [[The Empire|the Empire]] ever finds itself in a position where it is not at [[War|war]] with any neighbouring great power.
### Options
Ritual Substitution|orichalcum|ingots
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional armies from the same Empire. The general responsible for each army must be present throughout the ritual. Each additional target increases the magnitude by 90.
## Description
This ritual draws on pacts with [[Eleonaris]] the [[Eternal]] Queen of [[The Fields of Glory|the Fields of Glory]] in the [[Summer Realm|Summer realm]]. The ritual [[Calls|calls]] one of her hosts to join an established campaign army and [[Fight|fight]] alongside the troops for a season. These troops come from Eleonaris realm and may includ elfin knights, rambunctious goblinfolk, and even monstrous beasts. They are usually attired in gold-and-crimson surcotes and [[Fight|fight]] under the lion [[Banner|banner]] of their mistress, although some of their heralds [[Will|will]] also fly pennants appropriate to the main army if they are asked to do so. They are almost invariably attired in heavy armour, often of burnished bronze, sungold or (in the case of champions) [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]]-steel. They will die as easily as mortal troops, but they seem to treat death as a minor inconvenience or even a surprise - it is as if they consider themselves immortal. If challenged, they are likely to shrug and comment enigmatically that their slain comrades will "''Return to the fields of [[Glory|glory]], by and by.''"
The summoned soldiers fight with the appearance of great bravery and civility. They are cordial to mortal soldiers, although they can be a little distant. They engage mercilessly, with great ferocity, and seem to take an unholy joy in challenging and defeating any enemies. They will happily engage in tourneys or honour duels with mortal champions, but they lack a sense of consequences . This means that duels often end in death, or maiming, unless their opponents are very clear on the rules. They are also disinclined to stealth, ambush, or other guerrilla tactics preferring to face their opponents head-on. They love to fight other forces summoned from the [[Realms|realms]] - they will single out [[Groups|groups]] of shadow warriors, crystal guardians, or especially grim legionnaires unless explicitly ordered otherwise. Even then they chafe under such restrictions.
Knights summoned with this ritual are unable to pass through the [[Sentinel Gate]]. As with creatures such as the shadow warriors bound by the [[Conclave of Trees and Shadow]] or the prismatic soldiers raised by [[Carve the Crystal Guardian]] it seems that the [[Magic|magic]] of the [[Gate|gate]] cannot transport them. Attempts to do so result in the knights disappearing - apparently returned to the Summer realm prematurely.
When the enchantment ends, the knights travel to the nearest Summer [[Regio]] and depart the mortal realm. They carry with them any of their number who have fallen in battle. The arms and armour of any soldier left behind, tend to disappear at around this time - never overtly, but when unobserved the items vanish. The same applies to any remains of dead knights not retrieved by their comrades.
Eleonaris receives a full report from her troops when they return to her, and if they are mistreated, betrayed, or misused in some fashion she is likely to swear vengeance against the perpetrators. On the few occasions in the past when this has happened, she has called a truce with both her perennial rival [[Jaheris]] and her more occasional sparring partner [[Hayaak]] the gryphon-king and enlisted both of them in seeking revenge on those who have dared to betray her trust.
## Common Elements
It is exceptionally common to include a flag, pennant, banner or standard as part of this ritual, especially one that bears the device of Eleonaris - a golden lion on the red field. Other common elements include the invocation of brave warriors who have fought for [[The Empire|the Empire]] in the past, and symbols of [[Pride]] and [[Courage]]. Other elements include girding [[The Military|the military]] leader, the sound of martial horns or drums, and the presence of warriors from the same nation as the target as witnesses.
The [[Rune|rune]] of victory, [[Tykonus]], is favoured for this ritual both for its association with banners and flags and for its connection to the [[Eternal]] Lady of the Crimson Host.
## [[History]]
OOC Note
The knights that are summoned by this ritual will not appear at the event as a result of this ritual being cast. They will only appear in response to plot created by a plot writer. Whatever happens, such knights cannot pass through [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] Gate, so they can never assist the heros of [[Anvil]] on [[Battles|battles]] or skimishes that take place during the summit.
During the Summer Solstice 383YE, Eleonaris placed restrictions on the performance of [[Knights of Glory]]. Her herald delivered a proclamation to the members of [[The Conclave|the Conclave]], laying down her concerns and ultimately ending with a promise that further castings of the ritual by the Empire may incur serious consequences. Eventually the angry eternal was mollified by the construction of a monument honouring Eleonaris and her knights in [[Semmerholm]]. She made it clear at this time that she would no longer countenance the performance of [[Knights of Glory]] by ''any'' caster and would instead be presenting a new ritual to Brother Luke, in his role as [[Archmage of Summer]].
The replacement ritual was meant to be created by the Golden [[Magician]] on Eleonaris' behalf. However before the Lord of the Lake could undertake the work, the subtle influence of the ongoing conjunction of [[The Lock]] and [[The Key]] exerted small but significant changes to the ritual. Eleonaris has declared herself to be content with the ritual in its new form. Rather than require the [[Conclave]] to go throught the rigmarole of placing a new ritual into [[Imperial lore]], she has sent word to the [[Archmage]] that she is now happy for Imperial magicians to call upon her aid by performing Knight of [[Glory]] - provided of course that her assurance remains intact.
### Eternal Rivals
Some Enchanters of [[Dawn]] say that in the past [[Jaheris]], the consort-rival of Eleonaris, offered gifts that allowed the ritual to summon troops loyal to his silver-and-blue Unicorn standard. Similar gifts were apparently offered by [[Hayaak]] the Lord of Wrath to summon his hosts of vengeance; by [[Cathan Canae]] to call forth her cold-hearted giant warriors; and occasionally by [[Barien]], the [[Arbiter|arbiter]] of [[Worth|worth]], as a reward for those who have bested one of his challenges  Regardless of what may have once been possible, the ''Commander of the Golden Armies'' has put a stop to her ritual being used in such a way. Shortly before the [[Autumn]] Equinox 383YE, Eleonaris claimed she had "taken back control" of the ritual. Knights of Glory was crafted with her power, she claimed, and it had only been through her grace that other eternals had been able to make use of it. That grace was now withdrawn, as was her right. The ritual will now only bring forth knights from [[The Fields of Glory|the Fields of Glory]]. "''Let other eternals [[Empower|empower]] their own magical [[Rituals|rituals]] if they wish to aid the Empire''," she concluded.
### Enmity and Neutrality
At the [[Winter]] Solstice 379YE the eternal was given Enmity by the [[Imperial Conclave]]. It was thus a crime to perform this ritual. At the [[Spring]] Equinox 380YE Conclave voted to return Eleonaris to the state of Neutrality, which among other things made this ritual once again legal to perform.
