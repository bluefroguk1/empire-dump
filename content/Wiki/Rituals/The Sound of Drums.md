Season Duration
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 9. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
When the drums pound and the horns are blown, those under this [[Enchantment]] find it difficult to rein in their enthusiasm. Their hearts beat faster, and their limbs ache to be wielding their weapons. They can shrug off blows that would incapacitate a lesser warrior, even drawing on the fierce love of battle that the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] creates to drive them back to their feet, ready to fight again.
This ritual is occasionally used on battlefield healers, but there have been incidents where some of those healers were unable to resist the urge to get involved in the fighting, often with tragic consequences for themselves and their allies. 
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves music, most commonly drumming. A common element involves synchronizing the beat of the drums to the heartbeat of the target, and then slowly accelerating as the ritual moves towards its climax.
The rune [[Jotra]] is often used with this ritual, and evocations of [[The Stallion]], of horses or bears, and especially of [[Legendary beasts#Gryphons|gryphons]] and [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]]..
