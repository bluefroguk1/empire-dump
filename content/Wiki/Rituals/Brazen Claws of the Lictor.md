## Description
This [[Enchantment]] allows the target to wrap their enemies in invisible chains, As with [[Stance of the Constricting Scourge]] this ritual allows the target to restrict the moment of their opponent using the [[Entangle]] spell without having to expend personal mana. It is useful against skirmishing opponents on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], but it is also sometimes used to help capture gangs of fugitive criminals.
The ritual evokes themes of ownership, punishment and control. It encourages the target to take vengeance on those they consider to have wronged them, meaning it is often viewed with suspicion by followers of [[The Way|the Way]]. At the same time this reminder of past offences against the target or their [[Family|family]] is seen as a bonus in some parts of [[The Marches]], where the people have long memories. It also reminds the target of debts owed or owing; this gives it particular resonance with the dead reckoning of [[The League]], and coincidentally ensures that the targets become aware of any debts they incur or that are incurred while under the influence of the enchantment.
The [[Autumn]] eternals known as the [[Lictors]] are not themselves directly invoked by this ritual, despite the fact that it delivers similar powers to those these creatures are said to wield. The [[Lictors]] hunt oath-breakers, and those who refuse to honour agreements, contracts or obligations. They are said to resemble hooded figures wrapped in heavy iron and [[Green iron|green iron]] chains, with razor-sharp brass claws and horns, and iron face-masks. Armed with scourges, whips, flails, ropes and nets they stalk the dark places of the Autumn [[Realm|realm]]. According to some stories, they can be summoned to pursue, capture and punish those who have broken important oaths or refused to honour their debts.
## Common Elements
This ritual invokes powers of binding, capturing and punishment. It often includes instruments of [[Restraint|restraint]] such as chains, ropes, nets and even ribbons. Targets may be wrapped in chains or ropes by the ritualists. Invocations of [[Heroes|heroes]], [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] whose stories include tracking, chasing and capturing fugitive (such as the [[Paragon|paragon]] [[Vardas]]) are a common element. The [[Rune|rune]] [[Hirmok]] may be [[Painted|painted]] on the targets, and the trappings of judges, thief-takers, bounty hunters and badgers may all be used. In [[The League]] it is common to place metal masks on the targets, or ask them to recite a list of debts they wish to collect. Similarly in [[The Marches]] a series of grudges might be recounted.
Tokens of green iron are often used in this ritual - even if the metal is not being used to [[Empower|empower]] the target directly  tokens made from these [[Materials|materials]] may be given to the targets.
