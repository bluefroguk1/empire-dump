## Rules
Season|Winter|6
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 The ritual targets a single character or item which must be present throughout and, in the case of an item, close enough to touch. It can also be performed to target the immediate area surrounding the ritualists.
### Effects
The ritual reveals information about any and all curses on the target person, place, or thing. It is most often used on a character or item that is present, but can also be used in an area that is under a [[Curse|curse]] such as that created by [[Naeve]]'s Twisting Blight, provided the contributors are in that area. 
When completed the ritual answers some or all of the following questions about each [[Curse|curse]] that is present on the target: 
* What does this curse do? How does it work?
* How long [[Will|will]] it last if nobody intervenes?
* How can the curse be removed? 
* [[Will]] anything make the curse worse?
* Where has this curse come from? This will usually indicate a [[General|general]] source rather than a specific one - "an [[Eternal|eternal]]" rather than "the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Sorin]]" or "a spirit" rather than "the King at the [[Crossroads]]". If the source is a ritual, it will reveal the [[Realm|realm]] and magnitude. If the source is a spirit, it may reveal the strength of [[Exorcism]] required to remove it.
The [[Magic|magic]] that analyses the curse can be stymied by shrouds or masks of greater magnitude. In this case, it always reveals the [[Realm|realm]] and magnitude of the shroud, and whether there is any information that can be discerned by [[Wisdom of the Balanced Blade]].
The divination function of the [[Detect Magic]] spell will indicate if there is information that can be found with [[Wisdom]] of the Balanced Blade - which is usually a clear sign that the target is cursed in some way.
### Additional Magnitude
You may increase the magnitude of the ritual to penetrate more powerful shrouds or masks.
### OOC Note
The ritual is least useful when used to analyse the effects of ritual curses that are in [[Imperial lore]]. It can be used in a [[Territory|territory]] under the effect of a curse to determine details of that effect. This effect ''cannot'' be achieved by performing the ritual at the [[Anvil]] [[Regio|regio]] - attempts to do so simply provide information about the [[Anvil]] [[Regio|regio]] and any magical effects on [[Casinea]]. 
## Description
While many [[Winter]] magicians are adept at identifying the effects of curses that are part of the wider body of [[Imperial lore]], this ritual helps analyse a curse whose details and potential counters are unknown. It may be used to divine the details of a curse that has come from an Eternal, from the [[Rituals|rituals]] of a [[Barbarian|barbarian]] [[Magician|magician]], or from more esoteric sources - it can discern the details of curses inflicted by malign spirits, as well as those brought down by less understood means such as broken oaths or vile transgressions.
The ritual has some similarities to [[Bright Lantern of Ophis]], but it only analyses curses - while the Bright Lantern cannot analyse curses at all. Sometimes the information it provides requires some interpretation. For example, it might discover that a certain farmer has become cursed, and that the provenance is "their own dark deeds" and that the curse can only be removed by "atonement" - what precisely that may mean will require further investigation. Usually, the information is much more straightforward - a curse is due to the actions of someone else, and the method of dealing with it may be difficult but clearly understood. 
When used to study a curse placed by an eternal, the ritual rarely reveals the precise eternal involved - usually it will simply provide the realm. This is not always the case - some eternals seem to ''want'' their involvement in a situation to be clear, especially those of the [[Winter Realm|Winter realm]]. Likewise, when providing information about how a curse might be lifted it is just as common to learn that a "powerful supernatural creature such as an eternal" might lift a curse as it is to determine the precise eternal capable of doing so. 
The ritual is sometimes called (''Grandmother's/Grandfather's) Appraising Eye''.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves carefully examining the target. Active divination may take place, often with runestones or cards. Other, more exotic, methods of diagnosis might be used as well such as observing if the presence of the target has any effect on a lodestone, or on fresh milk; letting droplets of their blood, phlegm or sweat fall into fresh water or cream; or getting the target to throw a handful of runestones or sticks, or spatter blood onto a hide covered in [[Runes|runes]], and observing the results. Lenses might be used to examine the target; lights used to make their shadow move; and mirrors used to catch their reflection. The [[Rune|rune]] [[Irremais]] is commonly invoked, as are the names of wise [[Paragons and Exemplars]], folk [[Heroes|heroes]] or the Eternal [[Wise Rangara]].
