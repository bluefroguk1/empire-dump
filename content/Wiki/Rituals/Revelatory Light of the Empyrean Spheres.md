## Rules
Season|Day|150
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must be a contributor participating in the performance of the ritual.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This [[Enchantment|enchantment]] allows the target to call MASS PARALYSE once during the duration. The character must be able to cast spells to make this call - it explicitly [[Will|will]] not work if they are wearing armour. 
While under the effect of the [[Enchantment|enchantment]], the target experiences a powerful [[Roleplaying effect]]: they feel detached from their emotions, and their passions are muted. They are conscious of their emotions, but not moved by them. This effect is especially pronounced for those with the [[Merrow]] [[Lineage]], and they may find they have additional difficulty understanding the emotional states of others, perhaps even going so far as to be mildly irritated by emotional displays.
The character who unleashes the power of the ritual is blinded for thirty seconds; they cannot see anything for the duration.
[[Day]] Duration The power of the ritual can be invoked only ''once'' during this time.
### Additional Targets
The ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same [[Coven|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude of the spell by 100. Additional [[Characters|characters]] must be present throughout, and each must contribute to the performance of the ritual.
### Option

## Description
This [[Battlefield Ritual|battlefield ritual]] allows a powerful magical attack to be unleashed against a group of enemies, freezing them in place for a dozen heartbeats allowing them to be easily butchered. As with [[Inescapable Chains of Bitter Glass]], the effectiveness of the [[Magic|magic]] depends almost entirely on the discipline and decisive action of those accompanying the [[Magician|magician]], but the ten seconds that all the targets are completely incapable of action it should be possible to defeat practically any opponent.
The ritualist who unleashes the power of this magnitude is stuck temporarily blind, and may suffer other side effects. For a few moments, they perceive a limitless expanse of knowledge and cosmic awareness. The experience rarely lasts more than a second or so, but it can leave them mentally scarred and unstable, their sanity blasted and their mental stability crumbing. Very rarely, if they survive this experience, they may recall a momentary fragment of useful information but usually they are simply blasted by the powers unleashed.
The ritual is rarely used in [[The Empire|the Empire]] due to the difficulty of finding the best moment to unleash it, where it [[Will|will]] provide sufficient tactical advantage to make up for the ruinous [[Cost|cost]] and the devastation it can wreak on the ritualist who unleashes it.
## Common Elements
It is difficult to speak of common elements due to the comparatively small number of covens who have mastered this ritual. They would include mirrors; bright lights; geometric shapes (especially spheres, cones and pyramids) and mathematical formulae; tomes of lore; carefully scored [[Music|music]] with stringed instruments such as harps; careful movement and invocations of raw knowledge and dangerous power. Completion of the ritual is usually signalled by a great cry of triumph or the sounding of many horns.
Other common elements in this ritual might include the [[Rune|rune]] of revelation, the rune of destruction or the rune of dominion. [[Mawrig]] is used when the ritualists seek to wreak devastation on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]; some magicians believe that it is likely to leave the contributor who releases the effect more damaged than the use of [[Hirmok]], which seeks to constrain and [[Challenge|challenge]] the raw power of this spell.
Needless to say, the [[Constellations|constellations]] are often evoked during this ritual, especially [[The Great Wyrm]], [[The Door]], [[The Key and The Lock]].
"Have you ever seen someone die of perfection?  Have you ever experienced the light of a million dancing spheres as it seared your soul with beauty?  Heard the laughter of dragons echoing in your skull like golden thunder, on and on, until insanity seemed like a blessing and death a sweet release?  Have you ever tasted a truth so profound that it felt like a bucket of live coals rattling around inside your head?  Ever felt yourself struck dumb with insights so terrible your tongue simply refuses to utter them?"
The old woman with glared down at the young boy, poking him with one bony finger to punctuate each question.
"Well, apprentice, have you?
"No, mistress", he kept his eyes downcast.
"No.", she said with finality, "Pray that you never do."  
She took the book of [[Rituals|rituals]] from his hands and placed it back in its place upon the high shelf by memory, for her milky eyes saw nothing, "Pray that you never do..."
