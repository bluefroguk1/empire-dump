## Description
The power of this ritual enCourages bad weather across the territory, but also brings with it a malaise that seeps into the spirits of magicians - while their personal mana reserves are not affected, they often become either lethargic and depressed or short-tempered and aggressive if they spend an extended period in the territory.
The ritual also effects supernatural creatures, either encouraging them to become lethargic and docile or aggressive and ill-tempered. Used against the barbarians, it is most likely to penalise the [[Thule]] and the [[Druj]] rather than the [[Jotun]] or the [[Grendel]]. 
The ritual is only known to have been invoked once in the last hundred years by Imperial citizens on an Imperial territory; during a dispute between a Freeborn covens based in Siroc and several troupes in [[Sarvos]], the ritual was used by the Freeborn to drain the mana sites of the City of Jewels. In this case, the Freeborn coven were exonerated by the [[Imperial Conclave]] who deemed the matter to be resolved internally without the intervention of magistrates. The ritual is not deemed to involve theft - the mana is simply depleted, not stolen.
A few scholars are concerned about where the mana is going if it is not forming mana crystals; suspicious types suggest it is being stolen by or channelled into the Winter [[Realm]] in some way.
## Common Elements
The ritual releases a malign, oppressive force into a territory. Grim, throbbing Musical rhythms, slow threatening movement and invocations of dread and hunger are all used to raise and direct this malign power. It is common to evoke the rune [[Naeve]] or [[Kyrop]] with this ritual. Some [[Wintermark]] covens attempt to channel or mitigate its effects with [[Hirmok]], or to channel the depleted mana toWards their own [[Mana site]] but they do not report much success.
