## Rules
Season|Winter|15 
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction
regio|Winter Target [[Territory]]
[[Curse|curse]]
### Effects
The target territory is scoured with unpleasant weather, and magicians in the area begin to feel increasingly uncomfortable. In some cases they become depressed and lethargic, in others short tempered and aggressive. 
All mana sites in the territory provide only half as many mana crystals as they would otherwise produce in the coming season. The ritual may also damage weak [[Regio|regio]], as well as encouraging some magical beasts to either become lethargic or dangerously aggressive.
Season Duration
## Description
The power of this ritual encourages bad weather across the territory, but also brings with it a malaise that seeps into the spirits of magicians - while their personal mana reserves are not affected, they often become either lethargic and depressed or short-tempered and aggressive if they spend an extended period in the territory.
The ritual also effects supernatural creatures, either encouraging them to become lethargic and docile or aggressive and ill-tempered. Used against the [[Barbarians|barbarians]], it is most likely to penalise the [[Thule]] and the [[Druj]] rather than the [[Jotun]] or the [[Grendel]]. 
The ritual is only known to have been invoked once in the last hundred years by Imperial citizens on an Imperial territory; during a dispute between a [[Freeborn]] covens based in Siroc and several [[Troupes|troupes]] in [[Sarvos]], the ritual was used by the Freeborn to drain the mana sites of the City of Jewels. In this case, the Freeborn [[Coven|coven]] were exonerated by the [[Imperial Conclave]] who deemed the matter to be resolved internally without the intervention of [[Magistrates|magistrates]]. The ritual is not deemed to involve theft - the mana is simply depleted, not stolen.
A few scholars are concerned about where the mana is going if it is not forming mana crystals; suspicious types suggest it is being stolen by or channelled into the [[Winter]] [[Realm]] in some way.
## Common Elements
The ritual releases a malign, oppressive force into a territory. Grim, throbbing musical rhythms, slow threatening movement and invocations of dread and hunger are all used to raise and direct this malign power. It is common to evoke the [[Rune|rune]] [[Naeve]] or [[Kyrop]] with this ritual. Some [[Wintermark]] covens attempt to channel or mitigate its effects with [[Hirmok]], or to channel the depleted mana towards their own [[Mana site]] but they do not report much success.
