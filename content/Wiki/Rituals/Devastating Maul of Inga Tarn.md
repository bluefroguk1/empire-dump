### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same [[Banner|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 15. Additional [[Characters|characters]] must be present throughout.
## Description
This ritual is named for the exemplar of [[Courage]] [[Inga Tarn]], whose miraculous strength and unquenchable spirit serve as an inspiration throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]]. It allows an individual to [[Shatter|shatter]] the shields and weapons of their opponents, leaving them vulnerable or impotent. It is most effective when used on someone who already possesses a reserve of inner strength, but might be useful to the wearer of a suit of [[Runeplate]] and it clearly valuable to the wielder of a Trollslayer's Crescent. If the chosen target has access to a stock of [[Philtres of War]], they can get even more use out of the power this [[Enchantment|enchantment]] grants.
Other versions of this ritual exist; ''The Ruinous Blade'' is a similar ritual that is often used with greatswords or two-handed axes, while ''The Trollcrusher's Mattock'' is an old name for the ritual attributed to the [[Steinr]] runesmiths or [[Hahnmark]].
## Common Elements
This ritual often involves symbols of [[Courage]], and invocations of physically powerful creatures such as bears, gryphons or dragons. Sometimes riven shields are used as a component, and the target may be encouraged to undertake a symbolic act of destruction as part of the performance such as breaking a board with fist or foot.
[[Verys]], the run of might is commonly used with this ritual, either drawn on the arms of the target or on their two-handed weapon.
