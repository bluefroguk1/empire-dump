### Effects
This ritual creates a Curse that is delivered to a target with a pronouncement of doom: one contributor is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the effect of the curse, the character cannot make use of [[Liao]]; they can't use or contribute to the performance of any Religious skill. This applies even if the character is using an ability or item that allows them to use Religious [[Religious skills]] without actually using any liao (such as the power of a [[Mendicant Cassock]]).
They also experience a Roleplaying effect; you are assailed by doubt, especially as regards your strongest held Convictions, and beliefs. The stronger you believe something to be true, the stronger the doubts become. Occasionally, you may hear a barely audible voice whispering in your ear, telling you that everything you believe is flawed and nothing more than fantasy. You may also occasionally glimpse of a gaunt, hateful spirit lurking nearby reflected in mirrors.
Year Duration

The Curse can be alleviated by an powerful [[Exorcism]] as if it were a spirit with a strength of 20.
