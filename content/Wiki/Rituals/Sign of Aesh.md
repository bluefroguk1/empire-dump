## Rules
Season|Day|8
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 This ritual can 'only' be performed by a single ritualist, and cannot be performed using a [[Coven|coven]] bond.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
This [[Enchantment]] effects only the caster. It reduces the magnitude of the next ritual they cast by themselves without drawing on a coven bond by two. While the enchantment persists the caster experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: you feel clear-headed and find it easy to recall minor details of things you have read or seen, especially things to do with magical lore.
The enchantment ends when the ritualist performs a ritual alone, or at the next sunrise, whichever comes first.
## Description
This is an old spell, and has largely been superseded by the use of the coven. It allows a [[Magician|magician]] who is capable of achieving a magnitude eight ritual by themselves to perform a ritual that is otherwise slightly out of their reach. It is common for a magician using this ritual to take advantage of things that enhance ritual ranks, potentially putting many more [[Rituals|rituals]] within reach of the solo caster. For example, a magician who can only just perform this ritual alone can then use [[Regio]], potions and the effects of other [[Rituals|rituals]] in combination with this enchantment to achieve surprising results without a coven.
The enchantment effects the 'next' ritual the magician performs by themselves; they can still work with a coven (either their own, or through the use of an item such as the [[Volhov]]'s Robe) without discharging the effects. This ritual 'never' reduces the magnitude of a spell cast by a coven.
There are all sorts of subtle uses for this ritual. An itinerant volhov may take advantage of an enhancement at a [[Regio|regio]] to perform this ritual, allowing them to perform a ritual of similar power later in the [[Day|day]]. A [[League]] [[Mountebank|mountebank]] might be able to bring a ritual of another [[Realm|realm]] within their grasp despite their focus on [[Day rituals]]. An adept of Day with access to plenty of crystal mana who can just about cast this ritual might grant themselves the ability to cast [[Clear Lens of the Eternal River]] with ease. There are plenty of other examples, most of which rely on the ritualist having a good supply of crystal mana.
## Common Elements
This ritual is always performed by a single ritualist, so has a tendency to be quite low-key. It often involves meditation, or recitation of a complex magical invocation. Some ritualists like to work on a series of mathematical formulae, moving numbers through complex iterations as they focus their minds; others achieve similar effects by performing mental exercises such as writing the names of all the Emperors and Empresses in order. Books, scrolls and other written [[Materials|materials]] are commonly involved. Bells, chimes and gongs might be used, with the character focusing on their fading notes; likewise slow, repetitious movements can help relax the body and free the mind. Ritualists sometimes draw a complex diagram on the ground, sometimes with coloured sand of powder, and sit within it as they meditate. Other ritualists use lenses to concentrate on creating minuscule, delicate designs.
The [[Rune|rune]] [[Aesh]] is almost always evoked with this spell, often in the form of a complex hand-gesture.
