## Description
Sometimes a [[Chirurgeon|chirurgeon]] finds that time is against them, and that life hangs in the balance. Sometimes a warrior needs to get a comrade to safety ''now'', before the enemy can kill them both. The ''Chirurgeon's Healing Touch'' ritual gives immediate options to the target, allowing them to quickly get an ally on their feet and moving under their own steam.
To use the healing power provided by this ritual, the recipient usually breathes deeply onto their cupped hands, or rubs them swiftly together to make them warm, then places them on the forehead of their injured companion. Warmth and vitality then flows from the lungs and heart, through the hands, into the patient and jolts them back to life.
## Common Elements
As with many healing [[Rituals|rituals]], blood and water are common elements, but so is the concept of breath and breathing. Washing the hands with water or wine is common, as is the inhalation of steam especially steam from a bowl where healing [[Herbs|herbs]] are brewed. The True Vervain [[Herb|herb]] is especially valuable as a symbol for this ritual, and the pungent juice of crushed leaves is often used as a way to boost the power of the ritual - while it is rare to see a [[Coven|coven]] use large amounts of true vervain (it is rarely effective to consume the healing power of the [[Herb|herb]] to grant healing powers), it is sometimes used to make the ritual more accessible to smaller [[Groups|groups]]. 
Invocations using the names of great healers, [[Legendary beasts|legendary beasts]] such as the firebird, and and the [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Fountain]] are all popular images to use with this ritual. [[Runes]] such as [[Rhyv]] may be used, but the healing might also be evoked through the [[Rune|rune]] of thought or the rune of majesty.
