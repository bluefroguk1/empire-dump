## Description
This ritual allows a Warrior to strike devastating blows with a one-handed spear that penetrate all but the strongest armour, piercing flesh and Shattering bone. It brings with it a strong urge to take righteous vengeance against those who have wronged the target, fanning feelings of wrath and anger. The Enchantment is often associated with the [[Eternal]] [[Hayaak]], the Lord of Gryphons, who demonstrates a stormy temper and a strong sense of natural justice, revenge and an ability to hold grudges for a long period of time.  
The spell is sometimes called ''Horn of the Unicorn'', especially by the [[Navarr]] and those few Dawnish ritualists who know the ritual. It is also known as the ''Narwhal's Harpoon'' in [[Wintermark]] and as the ''Stance of Harnessed Wrath'' by the [[Urizen]] battle Magicians who use it to allow their allied Sentinels to deliver pin-point, devastating strikes
## Common Elements
As an Enchantment this ritual often involves giving the target a token or marking them or their weapon in some way. A toast may also be appropriate, especially one in which the target recalls their reasons for seeking the enchantment, or those who have wronged them in some way who will be made to pay (although many priests take a dim view of that kind of behaviour). This ritual often includes the use of the [[Runes]] [[Verys]] or [[Feresh]] and invocations of gryphons, narwhals or unicorns.
