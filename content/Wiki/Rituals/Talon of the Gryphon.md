## Description
This ritual allows a warrior to strike devastating blows with a one-handed spear that penetrate all but the strongest armour, piercing flesh and shattering bone. It brings with it a strong urge to take righteous vengeance against those who have wronged the target, fanning feelings of wrath and anger. The [[Enchantment]] is often associated with the [[Eternal]] [[Hayaak]], the Lord of Gryphons, who demonstrates a stormy temper and a strong sense of natural justice, revenge and an ability to hold grudges for a long period of time.  
The spell is sometimes called ''Horn of the Unicorn'', especially by the [[Navarr]] and those few Dawnish ritualists who know the ritual. It is also known as the ''Narwhal's Harpoon'' in [[Wintermark]] and as the ''Stance of Harnessed Wrath'' by the [[Urizen]] battle magicians who use it to allow their allied sentinels to deliver pin-point, devastating strikes
## Common Elements
As an [[Enchantment]] this ritual often involves giving the target a token or marking them or their weapon in some way. A toast may also be appropriate, especially one in which the target recalls their reasons for seeking the [[Enchantment|enchantment]], or those who have wronged them in some way who [[Will|will]] be made to pay (although many priests take a dim view of that kind of behaviour). This ritual often includes the use of the [[Runes|runes]] [[Verys]] or [[Feresh]] and invocations of gryphons, narwhals or unicorns.
