## Description
This ritual imbues a character with the ability to deliver a deadly strike that plays havoc with the life-force of their opponent. Using a weapon or implement as a conduit, powers of sickness and disease are released to run rampant through the enemy. While a portion of the power used in this ritual goes toWards creating the venomous strike, considerably more goes towards shielding the [[Enchanted]] individual from the consequences of that strike.
One advantage to the deadly strike granted by the ''[[Touch of Vile Humours]]'' is that it is equally effective when delivered by an armoured warrior as by a magician in robes or [[Mage]] armour. 
There are many uses for this ritual, from ensuring the demise of a hated opponent to preventing a husk, zombie or a creature with powerful Healing abilities from rising again after it has been defeated, to quickly dispatching a [[Vallornspawn husk]].
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes poisonous creatures or plants. Some magicians, especially [[Suaq]] icewalkers and [[Navarr]] vates, anoint the skin or weapons of the target. using blood mixed with poisonous plants or the venom of spiders, scorpions or serpents to create a thick paste reminiscent of  Oil of Blackoil of blackthorn. Other magicians invoke forces of plague, sickness and fever as they work their [[Magic]], viewing the ritual as being more concerned with turning the body of the target against itself.
The performance of this ritual is often subdued. Few magicians can deny that the powers it deals with are insidious, and potentially fatal. There are few uses to which venom can be put that do not result in death, and while the poison itself may be subtle the end result is anything but. Highborn and Freeborn ritualists alike combine solemn, leaden drum-beats with slow, threatening movement and droning chants as they go about performing this ritual. A number of ritualists end the ritual by ceremonially cleansing themselves with fresh water; [[Urizen]] mages and Varushkan cabalists alike know the danger of allowing any hint of residual [[Spring magic]] to infect them once the ritual is complete. 
Other elements might include the [[Runes]] [[Rhyv]], [[Naeve]] or [[Kyrop]] (often accompanied by the rune of dominion; the evocation of [[The Claw]] or [[The Drowned Man]]; a scene in which a [[Potion]] is brewed or a remedy spilled; or images of serpents, spiders, scorpions, wasps hydra, wyverns. or even chimerae.
