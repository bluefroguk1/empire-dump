## Rules
Season|Spring|19
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must have the  [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] skill.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
When the target [[Spellcasting#Swift casting|swift casts]] the [[Heal]] spell, they need only spend 1 mana rather than the usual 2 mana. The target does not gain any additional knowledge of, or ability to cast, the heal spell if they do not know it.
They also experience a [[Roleplaying effect]]: your empathy for other people is greatly enhanced. When you see a living creature in pain, you feel an urge to alleviate that pain - regardless of how you feel about that person.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 15. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
Where [[Fountain of Life]] allows a [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] to perform healing spells, ''[[Hands of the Healer]]'' allows a magician who is already proficient with magical healing to use their power significantly more quickly, and removes the possibility that they can be interrupted. The ritual accelerates the use of items such as the [[Acolyte's Mercy]] wand, as well as the spells cast by a magician under their own power. 
Unfortunately it does ''not'' allow a magician to use an item such as a [[Bloodwoven Braid]], which does not allow the spell to be swift cast, any more quickly.
The ritual also explicitly does ''not'' grant the target the ability to perform the heal spell; the target must already know how to cast the spell to be able to gain any benefit from the [[Enchantment|enchantment]]. 
Speeding up the use of the heal spell has obvious applications in dangerous environments; it allows a magician to provide magical healing on the front-lines without fear of being interrupted, or requiring their patient to stop defending themselves. 
Magicians who experience this [[Enchantment|enchantment]] speak of feeling as if the magical energy they draw on is eager to be unleashed. They recount an almost instant connection between themselves, their magic, and their target. The magic leaps easily across the gap from caster to patient; indeed, it is nearly impossible to hold it back. Experiments have shown that while a magician can choose to perform one of their healing spells in the usual manner while under this enchantment, doing so can cause them physical discomfort - one waggish [[Hakima]] likened it to having a particularly full bladder.
If the ritual has a drawback, it is that it greatly increases the ability of the magician to feel sympathy for those who are in pain. Some magicians find the experience of being on a battlefield especially upsetting; some especially sensitive magicians even speak of feeling the wounds inflicted on their allies and their enemies as if they were inflicted on themselves.
It is important to note that this ritual does ''not'' affect the performance of [[Rituals|rituals]] - [[The Hands of Sacred Life]] is not affected for example. The enchanted magician must be in some way "casting" heal to draw on this power.
## Common Elements
As with many healing [[Rituals|rituals]], blood and water are common elements. Washing the hands with water or wine is common, as are invocations using the names of famous or legendary physicians and healers. The [[Legendary beasts#Firebird|firebird]], which heals itself instantly with the power of flame; the herbs [[True Vervain|true vervain]] or [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]]; and the constellation of [[The Fountain]] are all popular images to use with this ritual.
Runes such as [[Rhyv]] or the [[Aesh|rune of thought]] may also be evoked - the first in its role as the rule of healing as well as bloodshed, the latter in its aspect as the rune that is concerned with education and mental skills. 
Some [[Dawn|Dawnish]] and [[Wintermark]] [[Rituals|rituals]] paint the [[Feresh|rune of majesty]] on the hands of the target, seeking to imbue them with consummate healing skill.
