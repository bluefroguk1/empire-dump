Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction
The ritual targets a single [[Mage|mage]] implement which must be present during the ritual.

The power of the ritual can be invoked only once.
Ten Minute Power
## Description
This [[Battlefield Ritual|battlefield ritual]] deals with similar forces to [[Ravenous Tongue of Entropy]], but on a much larger scale. it locates and exploits weaknesses in a [[Fortification|fortification]]. Beams warp and split, mortar crumbles, hawsers fray and snap and the entire edifice groans under the attack of [[Magic|magic]] that speeds decay and ageing. 
It often takes a short time for the full power of the ritual to manifest, which can make it a particularly dangerous ritual for the contributor charged with delivering the final stage and touching the target fortification. Some foolish covens have tried to perform the ritual while physically touching the fortification, while protected by heavily armoured warriors with powerful shields, but all it takes is a single arrow-shot from the defenders and the ritual collapses. It is much more common to see one or more well-defended ritualists [[Fight|fight]] their way through to the fortification with the charged implement, relying on the fact that at least one of them [[Will|will]] make it into position - and then either hold against the defenders, or retreat while the [[Magic|magic]] does its work.
This ritual targets the weakest parts of a defensive structure. While it may not collapse or destroy an entire wall, it is likely that the ritual [[Will|will]] create multiple breaches, tear down a gatehouse, collapse a row of mantlets or the like.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, a [[Coven|coven]] often invokes symbols of slow destruction - wind and rain - and forces of neglect, incompetence and misfortune that can combine to bring even the strongest structure into ruins. The [[Eternal]] [[Kaela]] may be invoked, and it is also common to use pieces from a ruined structure to help grant the ritual power. 
The implement charged with this spell is a key element in the ritual, and the role it plays in the performance is very important. Some covens may create a special staff or rod, often constructed from the wood of a collapsed building or rotted tree,  specifically for use with the ritual, which is then discarded after the battle. The implement may be passed between the ritualists, or placed at the centre of the ritual as a focus for the magic of the coven.
The [[Runes|runes]] [[Yoorn]] and [[Mawrig]] are often evoked with this ritual, and some [[Wintermark]] ritualists complete their casting by carving or painting them onto the structure they wish to destroy. The [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Key|the Key]] is sometimes evoked, as is [[The Wanderer]].
