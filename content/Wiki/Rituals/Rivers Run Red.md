Interdicted|ritual|[[381YE Autumn Equinox Conclave sessions|Autumn 381YE]]
## Rules
Season|Spring|50
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction
Regio|Spring Target Territory
[[Curse|curse]]
### Effects
The ritual targets a single territory. Over the course of the next few days a powerful [[Curse]] settles over the territory. All casualties suffered by campaign-level armies fighting in the targeted territory are doubled. 
Navies are only affected by this [[Curse|curse]] if they are taking a [[Navy orders|coastal order]], rather than a maritime order. The [[Curse|curse]] does not affect casualties caused by environmental factors, or by an army disbanding due to lack of support.
The civilian population of a territory will certainly be affected by this ritual.
This ritual removes the [[Rivers of Life]] [[Curse]], and is in turn removed by that ritual.

## Description
Where [[Rivers of Life]] fills the water in a territory with potent life-giving power, ''[[Rivers Run Red]]'' poisons the water. Worse, it encourages rivers, streams, and lakes to break their banks, causing widespread flooding. The watercourses rush fast and strong, overwhelming simple fords and threatening to sweep away bridges. Lowlands become mired with mud and marshes swell. Worse, the water itself encourages minor pestilence, the birth of venomous insects, and wounds that fester or become infected.
Like many similar [[Rituals|rituals]] from the Spring Realm, ''[[Rivers Run Red]]'' must be used carefully. It is most effective when the allied armies greatly outnumber their enemies; while the ritualists' allies will suffer a little from the ritual, the enemies may be effectively devastated by the increased casualties. The [[Druj]] in particular are known to make regular use of this ritual, ensuring that those who dare to engage them in battle pay a terrible price for doing so, even as their own warriors die in their droves.
For the common inhabitants, this means a miserable time. Death is significantly more likely from otherwise preventable causes, and sickness runs rampant. Its effects are of particular worry to the commanders of armies. The stinking mud and noisome rivers drain energy and slowly poison soldiers in the area. Even bottles of wine, barrels of beer, or fresh water in waterskins may be slowly influenced by this [[Curse]]. Warriors who receive severe, but not life-threatening, injuries often succumb to them rather than recovering. Even relatively minor wounds can become infected, leading to fever, delirium, and death. There are cases of simple insect bites that lead to a doughty warrior taking ill in the evening and being dead by the next morning.
Much as with [[Rivers of Life]], the ritual has fascinated Imperial magicians for centuries. It has a dramatic impact, but creating similar magical effects in other realms or which impact different elements of a [[Campaign outcome|military campaign]] have proved impossible without peculiar and unpredictable [[Astronomancy|conjunctions]]. Attempts to codify magic such as the Winter wind that exacerbated the situation in the Mournwold, for example, have been fruitless. Likewise, efforts to create similar curses or [[Enchantment|enchantments]] that fill a [[Territory]] with magic in the hope of influencing the effectiveness of [[Imperial army|armies]] have ended in failure. It is possible there is an [[Eternal]] involved, but unlike [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Forge the Wooden Fastness]] there has never been any hint that this is the case. Perhaps, like the peculiar properties of [[Traitor's Fate]] that allow its effects to be [[Traitor%27s Fate#Option|made permanent]] for a single ring of [[Ilium]], this is simply an example of a deeper mystery that will never be solved. 
In Winter 380YE, [[Rivers Run Red]] was one of two [[Rituals|rituals]] cast on the [[Mournwold]] during the [[381YE Spring Equinox winds of war#Let That Be Your Last Battlefield .28Mournwold.29|bloody battle]] with the [[Jotun]]. An absolutely ''astonishing'' number of people - [[Orc|orcs]] and humans alike - died as a direct consequence. The combination of Rivers Run Red and an eerie, sighing [[Winter magic|Winter]] wind killed a sixth of the civilian population across the Mournwold as well as more than half of the remaining population of the [[Mournwold#Greensward|Greensward]] where most of the fighting took place. There was [[All along the watchtower|extensive backlash]] from the Marches, and [[Empress Lisabetta]] herself became involved. Ultimately the Conclave chose to interdict the ritual, which helped to salve some of the anger from the Mournwold, but it quickly became clear that if that interdiction were removed any time soon there will be significant consequences. Indeed, questions about the Conclave's commitment to the interdiction arguably led to [[Tend to the Flame#What We Need Most|renewed calls]] for the creation of the [[Interdiction#Remorse|Declaration of Remorse]] as a way to permanently remove the ritual and similar curses from [[Formulaic ritual#Imperial Lore and the Ritual List|Imperial lore]]. One positive consequence of the enduring interdiction, at least in the Marches, is that it encouraged some [[Landskeeper|landskeepers]] to offer to help [[Farm]] owners there [[Honey and vinegar|augment their land]] with specially crafted menhirs. These allowed them to [[Farm#Diversification|diversify]] their farms so that they could produce small amounts of crystal mana to support magicians who worked to keep the ritual from ever being performed again.
## Common Elements
A map of the target territory often forms the focus of this ritual. It is often drenched during the casting in a mixture of muddy water or blood-and-wine. The runes [[Rhyv]], [[Kyrop]] and [[Mawrig]] are commonly used during this ritual, and the constellation of [[The Drowned Man]] is often invoked.
