Season Duration
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same coven. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 11. Additional characters must have the magician skill and be present throughout; each target receives the ability to cast the same spells.
## Description
Like [[Illuminate the Higher Mind]] and [[Transcendent Mastery]], this ritual imprints precise knowledge of how incantations are performed, their effects and limitations, into the mind of the target. By using that knowledge they can perform the spell 'by rote' and greatly increase their personal knowledge of magical incantations.
It allows a coven to focus their magical lore into a number of individual magicians, often with the intention of sending those individuals somewhere the coven as a whole are not going. It is rarely cast by a solo ritualist, although it would certainly be possible - the problem is that a ritualist powerful enough to perform the ritual solo rarely has a broad range of Skills from which to choose. That said, there are several cases where a venerable volhov or a wise one has shared potent incantations with a young apprentice, or a staid enchanter has bestowed a surprising range of battlefield incantations on an ally.
## Common Elements
The ritual usually involves a symbolic transfer of knowledge between the character or characters who know the chosen spells, and the recipients. Often this mimics the master/apprentice or student/teacher relationships, and sometimes it involves the casting of the spell to be taught. In cases where there are multiple magicians 'donating' spell knowledge, each will give a short lecture or demonstration in turn while the rest of the coven counterpoint with chants or gentle [[Music]].
