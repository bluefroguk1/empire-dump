## Rules
Season|Day|8
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Resource|Mine
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
At the start of the next event, the target [[Mine]] produces an additional eight ingots of material. The additional [[Materials|materials]] are always of the same type as the basic [[Mine|mine]], regardless of any improvements. 
At the completion of the ritual the owner of the [[Mine|mine]] experiences a short-lived [[Roleplaying effect]]: they can hear gemstones, metal objects and especially items that include large amounts of one of the four [[Materials|materials]] found in mines 'singing' to them when they are nearby; these items also seem to glow faintly when they handle them. The singing and glow can be almost hypnotic. This effect persists for around ten minutes.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional mines in the same [[Territory|territory]]. Each additional [[Mine|mine]] increases the magnitude by 6. The character who controls each [[Mine|mine]] must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
The practice of seeking precious metals and minerals underground is much enhanced by the addition of [[Day magic]]. Under the influence of this ritual, seams of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]], [[Green iron|green iron]] and [[Weltsilver]] ores and deposits of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] glow faintly and even seem to 'sing' to the miners, drawing them closer. The ritual gives voice to the clusters of jewels and richest, deepest seams of ores in the earth; miners find themselves possessed of a strange prescience of where to strike rock, and often talk about hearing the singing sound of the earth's bounty calling for their attention. 
Simple dowsing with a plumb-line and a piece of mineral becomes much more effective. The earth and stone underground seem almost to whisper to miners and engineers, warning them of flaws or weaknesses that might cause collapses. More care is taken to shore tunnels and galleries up, and while the workers are influenced to become more cautious, they are also [[Enchanted|enchanted]] to work with greater surety and deftness in the dark underground; even a faint candle [[Will|will]] give off enough light to [[Illuminate|illuminate]] a great gallery in a mine under the influence of this ritual.
Some [[Freeborn]] [[Storytellers|storytellers]] weave fanciful stories that suggest that all the jewels and precious [[Materials|materials]] that lie deep underground were originally pieces of enlightenment hidden there by a [[Night]] [[Eternal]], and that an unnamed [[Day]] [[Eternal]] is constantly seeking them, hoping to recapture enlightenment or that humanity [[Will|will]] eventually collect enough of them to uncover some ancient truth. Ritualists who give credence to these fables call this ritual ''Shining Stars, Buried Deep''.
## Common Elements
The ritual creates often involves a map of the mine that is to be [[Enchanted|enchanted]]; in the case of the [[Navarr]] a map of the [[Trods|trods]] near the mine may be studied, and the shapes worked into new designs suggesting swirling tendrils extending from the trods to embrace and surround the target area. Other common features include samples of the raw material most suited to the mines, especially samples that have come directly from the target mine; metal and minerals; mining tools; symbols of [[Prosperity]]; lanterns, lamps or candles; and mirrors, especially when used to capture and reflect the light of candles or lamps.
This ritual is often performed outside, under the open sky, at night - especially when the stars are visible, glittering like jewels in the night sky. The [[Rune|rune]] [[Sular]] is often invoked, as is [[Pallas]] the rune of wealth.
