### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction
This ritual targets a [[Fortification]], and must be performed in a strong [[Summer]] [[Regio]] in the [[Territory]] containing the [[Fortification|fortification]]. If the territory is part of [[The Empire|the Empire]], then it may instead be performed from the Imperial [[Regio|regio]]. 
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual summons a contingent of several dozen golden lions in service to the [[Eternal]] [[Meraud]] and binds them to protect the area around the target Fortification. They [[Fight|fight]] alongside any garrison or friendly soldiers, and mercilessly attack any enemy soldiers who enter the region. At the same time the fortification is strengthened and made more resistant to damage. The effective strength of the target fortification is increased by 1,500.

### Assurance
Following the [[Spring]] Equinox 385YE, a scholar at the Icy Crag of the [[Eternal]] Sun helpfully pointed out that the ritual has an assurance that had been overlooked. If the [[Imperial Senate]] ever dissolves the [[Conclave order]] of the [[Rod and Shield]], or alters their manifesto to remove the idea that ''[[Magic]] can determine the outcome of [[Battles|battles]] and wars'', the ritual loses all power.
## Description
This ritual was given as a gift to the [[Rod and Shield]] by the Eternal [[Meraud]]. Raewynn Farkas, then [[Grandmaster]] of the Rod and Shield, attempted to have the ritual added to [[Imperial lore]] in Spring 380YE, but due to a number of bureaucratic problems the ritual was not actually made available to the magicians of [[The Empire|the Empire]] until [[Autumn]] on the following year.
''[[Golden Ramparts]]'' infuses a Fortification with the power of the Summer eternal Meraud. The most obvious sign of the [[Enchantment]] is the appearance of several dozen magical golden lions - denizens of Meraud's [[Realm|realm]]. These lions are intelligent, and articulate, creatures - they generally refer to themselves as knights of the [[Summer Realm|Summer realm]]. They savagely attack anyone who seeks to damage the fortification, or the people of the region where it stands. They are sometimes accompanied by a cadre of Meraud's apprentices - heralds with powers comparable to those employed by Imperial battle mages who [[Fight|fight]] alongside the garrison.
At the same time, the fortification itself is reinforced. At sunrise, noon, and sunset, the ramparts and towers of the fortification shimmer with a perceptible golden [[Aura|aura]]. Soldiers who garrison the fortification feel confident and capable when in contact with the physical fortification itself, and certain that they can resist any attacker if they simply stand firm and fight bravely. This effect is particularly pronounced if the defender is a [[Changeling]] or a [[Magician|magician]] - indeed a [[Changeling|changeling]] magician may find the experience somewhat overwhelming and risk triggering an episode of [[Lineage|lineage]] madness if they are not careful.
The power of the ritual helps to protect the entire Territory where the [[Enchanted|enchanted]] fortification stands, but it is when attackers seek to assault the castle itself that it is at its most potent. The enchantment both makes it significantly harder to take the region where the castle stands, and causes attackers to suffer increased [[Casualties|casualties]]. The [[Weakness|weakness]] of the enchantment is similar to that involved in [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Knights of Glory]] - the additional forces do not absorb punishment that might cause the castle to collapse.
During the ritual, the [[Coven|coven]] must clearly indicate the fortification they wish to affect – the name of the target, and both the territory and region it occupies, are the bare minimum required. The biggest restriction on performing the ritual is the requirement that it be performed in a Regio. While it can be performed at the Imperial Regio at [[Anvil]], this is of no help if the fortification that is to be [[Enchanted|enchanted]] is not in an Imperial Territory.
The ritual itself has something of a shadowy reputation. There are rumours that it was a bribe used to encourage the Rod and Shield to attack the Regio associated with the Icy Crag of the Eternal Sun, bringing the frozen wrath of [[Cathan Canae]] to bear on that [[College of Magic|college of magic]]. The source of the rumour is believed to be the eternal [[Jaheris]], however, and as such should be taken with a pinch of salt.
## Common Elements
Performance often uses a map of the territory where the fortification stands - or of the fortification itself. Images or effigies of the castle may also be involved. References to the enduring majesty of the stars – or the astronomantic [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Mountain]] - resonate strongly with its performance. The [[Runes|runes]] [[Tykonus]] and [[Feresh]], which represent victory and majesty, are another obvious component to use. In a dramaturgical context, [[The Bishop]] or [[The Captain]] would both be appropriate Personae to use.
An evocation of Meraud is a standard component of this ritual; indeed leaving it out could in theory offend the eternal whose power it draws on.
