### Effects
This ritual creates a Curse that is delivered to a target with a pronouncement of doom: one contributor is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the curse, the target experiences a Roleplaying effect; they feel chilly almost all the time, unless they are actively Warming themselves at a flame.
While under the Curse the target loses a quarter of any production that would have been provided by a [[Farm]], [[Forest]], or [[Herb garden]] resource.
The additional production provided by an [[Enchantment]] such as [[Rampant Growth]] or [[Gathering the Harvest]] is not affected by this Curse.
Year Duration
### Removing the Curse
The curse can be removed by certain powerful creatures or items.
## Description
This Curse focuses the withering energies of the Winter [[Realm]] onto a target, and through them onto their resources. Plants wither and die, or are attacked by parasites. It makes little difference if the target abandons their Farm, Forest, or [[Herb]] garden - within a few days the same unnatural decay begins to overwhelm any new resource of that type.
Several Eternals of Winter are known to have the power to remove this curse - and to deliver their own variants of it - especially [[Kaela]]. Unfortunately, she is much more inclined to enCourage the curse than to discourage the supernatural faMine it causes; it Generally requires a great deal of effort to encourage her to assist. [[Agramant]] also has the ability to remove this curse, but generally requires unspeakable acts of blood and slaughter before he is prepared to do so. By contrast, some eternals of Spring (notably Yaw'nagrah) are more than happy to help remove the effect... but this rarely leaves the resource in question any more productive.
## Common Elements
As with many curses, this ritual often involves a recitation of the grievances against the target; casting aside food or Forest resources, invoking the rune [[Naeve]], or calling on the names of eternals such as Kaela or [[Llofir]].
