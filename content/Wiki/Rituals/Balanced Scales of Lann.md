## Rules
Season|Autumn|20
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must have the [[Autumn]] lore skill. 
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains one effective rank of the Autumn lore skill for purposes of performing [[Rituals|rituals]], subject to the normal rules for effective skill. In addition, they gain the ability to trade valuable [[Materials]] for additional power. When performing an [[Autumn ritual]] they have mastered, they can substitute ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]], [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]], [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], or [[Green iron|green iron]] for crystal mana. Every 2 ingots spent counts as 1 crystal mana when contributing to the ritual. 
While the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] lasts, the target character experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: you sense that people who want you to do something for them without offering appropriate recompense are trying to take advantage of you. It is difficult for you to engage in even the most trivial social interactions without seeing them in terms of an exchange of influence and favours.
If the target is a [[Cambion]], the roleplaying effect is especially pronounced. A [[Cambion|cambion]] may also choose to temporarily add to or increase physical trappings of their [[Lineage|lineage]]. These changes are temporary and do not last more than a few hours after the enchantment ends. 
Season Duration
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same [[Coven|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 15. Additional [[Characters|characters]] must be present throughout.
### Option
Any caster who has mastered the ritual may choose to substitute ingots of tempest jade, orichalcum, or weltsilver, or green iron for crystal mana when contributing to it. Every 2 ingots spent count as 1 crystal mana when contributing to the ritual. The ingots need not be of the same type.
## Description
This Enchantment grants a [[Magician|magician]] improved facility with [[Autumn magic]]. It draws on a formal agreement between mortal magicians and the [[Eternal]] [[Ephisis]], enhancing their ability to perform [[Rituals|rituals]] from Autumn lore. Furthermore, the enchantment allows the magician to directly exchange ingots of valuable material for raw magical power; the ingots are claimed by [[Ephisis]] (or more correctly her agents). When using this additional facility, magicians usually place all the ingots they intend to use in their ritual in an opaque container such as a box or bag and formally offer them to the [[Eternal|eternal]] at the beginning of the ritual.
Unlike some similar rituals, the enchantment only allows a magician to trade [[Materials|materials]] for power when contributing to an Autumn ritual they have mastered. Magical scholars suggest this is a consequence of [[The Way|the way]] that creativity can create dissonance when working with Autumn [[Magic|magic]]. When [[Spring magic]] encourages spontaneity, and [[Summer magic]] delights in magicians taking risks, [[Autumn magic]] often favours a more rigid, considered approach to wielding power. 
The enchantment makes up for this rigidity by offering greater [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to trade raw materials for magical power. When using ingots to power a ritual, the magician formally offers them in trade for the raw magical potential they can then forge into the finished magical effect. In a nod to rituals such as Ephisis' Scale or [[Before the Throne of Estavus]], the materials a magician [[Will|will]] exchange for magical power are often placed in a sealed container and presented to Ephisis in return for the agreed upon magical affinity.
There are a few rumours of more potent versions of this ritual that permit a magician to trade ingots for magical energy to perform any mastered ritual, not just those of Autumn lore. There are also a few accounts of a similar ritual that revolves around an agreement with the eternal [[Prospero]] allowing magicians to instead trade measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], beggar's lye, [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]], and [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] for raw magical power.
## Common Elements
The ritual often involves some sort of symbolic exchange or balance. A target may begin with something representing their understanding of Autumn lore in one hand and transfer it to another hand, or they may trade it to one of the ritualists in return for a symbol of their new mastery. In other versions a symbol representing Autumn [[Magic|magic]], often [[Lann]] is inscribed on the skin - a blood [[Mage|mage]] [[Will|will]] often use blood donated by a Cambion to paint such a symbol.
In many cases, the crystal mana or materials intended to be used with this ritual will be sealed in an opaque container - often one that has been used to perform Ephisis' Scale. When the mana is used in such a fashion it is usually characterised as a "payment" to Ephisis in return for the power the enchantment provides. Some magicians include contracts in which they agree to always use a certain portion of ingots to perform their Autumn magic in the coming season - while the legal status of these contracts is unclear they often disappear during the performance of the ritual.
Unsurprisingly Ephisis (or one of her named Factotums) is usually evoked as the ritual is performed. A theurgist will often evoke paragons or exemplars of [[Prosperity]] or [[Wisdom]] when the ritual is performed - the exchange of wealth in return for a reward, or the idea of applying understanding to enhance [[Skills|skills]] both resonate well with this ritual.
