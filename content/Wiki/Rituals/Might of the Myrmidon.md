## Description
This ritual [[Enchantment]] empowers any warrior with great skill. It is a powerful effect that can turn provide a green recruit with the [[Skills|skills]] and knowledge of a champion. Unfortunately, it provides none of the experience that [[Will|will]] let a target wield those [[Skills|skills]] effectively on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], nor with the heroic spark they need to get the most out of their abilities. Indeed, a target may become rash, brash and foolhardy and charge recklessly into situations where an experienced veteran would hang back.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching [[Runes|runes]] on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. A toast is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. The target is often garbed or girded in a new surcote or tabard that bears their heraldry or livery; sometimes they are symbolically crowned with a wreath of flowers, leaves or even gold. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought and triumphed over mighty opponents, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 
Any of the [[Summer]] [[Runes|runes]] might be evoked, but [[Verys]], the [[Rune|rune]] of strength, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of strong and ferocious animals such as lions, bears, unicorns, chimerae and dragons. Any number of eternals might be mentioned, especially [[Eleonaris]] or [[Cathan Canae]],
