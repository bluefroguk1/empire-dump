While still in [[Imperial lore]], this ritual's usefulness has been greatly reduced. See [[Gift of Knowledge]] for the active version of this ritual.
Interdicted|ritual|Winter 382YE
## Rules
Season|Day|4
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 This ritual targets a single book, pamphlet, bundle of letters, scroll or tablet or similar written work that must be present throughout.
### Effects
When the ritual is complete, the target written work disappears and is received by the attendants of the Great Library in the [[Realm]] of Day. The book is sealed in an unused part of [[The Library]], and potentially destroyed.
This ritual will only transfer a scroll, pamphlet, tablet, book or similar piece of written work.
The Eternals are peripherally aWare of who sent the item.
## Description
Following from the [[Events]] of Autumn 382YE, the [[Eternal]] [[Phaleron]] no longer supports this ritual. While it is still in Imperial Lore, its usefulness has greatly deteriorated. Phaleron now seals books received with this ritual away, and has them destroyed, rather than having them read. In theory this would be a possible way to dispose of a dangerous book, but such a use might still attract the attention of Phaleron's attendants - and are unlikely to be seen in a positive light. An alternate ritual, the Gift of Knowledge, was given to Gancius della Notte di [[Sarvos]], the [[Archmage of Day]], at the Autumn Equinox 382YE, apparently containing a new ritual for sending books to the eternal.
The attendants at the Great Library of Phaleron are said to seek copies of everything ever written down, and they expand their collection through a number of ways; this ritual is one of the most common. Any written work transferred to the attendants will be preserved 'forever' (the attendants themselves tend to hedge their bets, and prefer to say that it will be stored for as long as Creation continues in its current form). It joins the great body of knowledge that the attendants maintain and constantly seek to expand. While Magicians can petition for access to any piece of information that has been stored in the library, such requests are rarely honoured. However, those who have contributed a significant tome to the library are more likely to be able to retrieve a piece of information from its depths. Someone who contributes a truly valuable or unique work may even be offered the chance to learn a single thing - the favour of the Phaleron library is a rare treasure. 
Some magicians include messages or Dedications in the works they send to the Great Library; these rarely seem to produce any immediate response although they are presumably read and catalogued alongside the book or scroll transferred with the ritual. Requests for audiences, the Visits of Heralds or the like are rarely successful; however, a ritualist or coven that consistently sends new, unique or profound texts to the Great Library occasionally receives visits from Heralds of Day requesting specific tomes.
It is understood that the ritual places no obligation on the eternals, but it cannot be denied that they tend to look more favourably on magicians who aid them by sending them works they do not currently possess. The rarer and more profound or influential the work, the more they appreciate it. The favour of the attendants at the Great Library also tends to leave other eternals of Day more well-disposed to a magician responsible for performing this ritual regularly. 
## Common Elements
The most important element of ''[[The Celestial Library]]'' is the written work to be transferred. It is often wrapped in fine silk or cotton, and usually forms the focus of the ritual; sometimes it is passed from hand to hand, sometimes placed in the centre of the ritual. Invocations of great scholars, [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Wisdom]], and the rune [[Aesh]] often accompany the ritual. 
Some ritualists wrap the book in a chain, and seal it with a lock during the ritual - the constellation of The Lock is unsurprisingly a common element of such [[Rituals]]. other ritualists seal the item with a wax seal, often marked with the rune of discovery or rune of revelation, as appropriate to the nature of the work. 
The completion of the ritual  is often signalled by sprinkling seawater on the written work.
