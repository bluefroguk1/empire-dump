## Description
This Enchantment is among one of the best-known [[Summer rituals]]. Along with [[Swift Leaping Hare]], The Swan's Cruel Wing and [[Strength of the Bull]] it provides a coven with the ability to select the right enchantment to enhance any band of Warriors. In this case, it allows those who wield  great weapons to strike a single devastating blow that will potentially maim or completely incapacitate an opponent. In [[Wintermark]], in keeping with the naming strategy of the other similar Rituals, it is known as ''Mammoth's Thunder''; the rest of [[The Empire]] tends to use the more common name.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their great weapon. A ritualist might trace matching [[Runes]] on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. A toast is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. Legendary warriors, especially those known for their strength or uncompromising nature, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 
Any of the Summer runes might be evoked, but [[Verys]], the rune of strength, is the most common (although the ill-favoured rune of storms may be used by especially [[War]]-like Magicians). An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of bears, bulls and other powerful creatures such as lions and mammoths.
