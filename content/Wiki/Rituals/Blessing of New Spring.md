### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional farms in the same [[Territory|territory]]. Each additional [[Farm|farm]] increases the magnitude by 1. The character who controls each farm must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This spell is intended to be cast at the Winter Solstice. It is less efficient and productive if cast later in the year and is useless if performed after the Summer Solstice.  If the spell is cast later in the year, then money that would have been provided during any missed seasons is lost. Performed at the optimal time, and left to run its full course, the ritual provides a total of 30 rings of additional profit to the owner of the target farm.
A farm affected by the ritual [[Will|will]] provide more and better crops, increasing the amount of money at the spring, summer and autumn equinoxes. Once it is in place, it also allows for more powerful [[Rituals|rituals]] to be cast. It serves as an anchor for the [[Strong Ox, Golden Sun]] ritual, permitting even more wealth to be reaped from the soil. 
The [[Blessing of New Spring|blessing of new spring]] is a very old ritual indeed, practiced in various forms throughout the world. The power of this ritual infuses animals and plants with vigour and fertility. Crops grow quickly, and in great abundance; they are naturally healthy and resistant to threats such as harsh weather, frost, disease and parasites. Animals are fruitful, with large litters, and young creatures grow quickly and enjoy great health. If there is a downside to the ritual it is that it increases the amount of work that must be done - crops must constantly be tended for weeds, and animals become a little more restive as they become more fruitful. 
In the long term, however, the benefits of this ritual should not be underestimated. It is understandably popular in [[The Marches]], and there are covens of landskeepers who work hard to ensure that they can perform this ritual on many farms simultaneously. Such covens also work to master Strong Ox, [[Golden Sun]] and [[Gathering the Harvest]] if they can, so they can offer even greater [[Prosperity|prosperity]] to the households and [[Monasteries|monasteries]]. With tension growing between householders and the [[Market Towns|market towns]], many landskeepers refuse to perform the [[Blessing of New Spring|blessing of new spring]] and similar [[Rituals|rituals]] to benefit the aldermen; the townsfolk have begun to look outside [[The Marches|the Marches]] for magical support for the few farms they do own.
## Common Elements
The ritual creates fertility and encourages hardy growth of plants and animals. Ritual performances often include the evocation of the [[Rune|rune]] [[Bravash]] or the [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Fountain]]. Hearth magics and symbols associated with health and [[Prosperity]] are also commonly evoked, such as shedding small amounts of blood or offering a cup or bowl of wine, ale, milk or mead to the targets.
In the [[Marches]], a portion of the produce that the farm produced the previous year might be used in the ritual; a similar element might be used in a [[Freeborn]] ritual intended to bless the produce of an orchard or vineyard.
Artificers can construct a ritual focus that enhances the performance of this ritual, and its associated rituals. The [[Straw Mask]] can be used any number of times a [[Day|day]], and it [[Will|will]] allow even a novice spring ritualist to perform Blessing of New Spring without having mastered it and without the [[Assistance|assistance]] of a [[Coven|coven]]; it will allow a more skilled ritualist to add an additional farm or two to the performance depending on the mastery of the wearer; and when combined with the Imperial [[Regio]] it will allow a [[Magician|magician]] with even a basic grounding in Spring lore to enchant several farms by themselves.
