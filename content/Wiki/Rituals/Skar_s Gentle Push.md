This ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same [[Banner|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 4. Additional [[Characters|characters]] must be present throughout. 
## Description
This ritual is developed from work originally done by Irontide Lok of the [[Imperial Orcs]]. It was codified at the Icy Crag of the [[Eternal]] Sun under the guidance of Ceinwein [[Eternal]] of the Eternal [[Family|family]]. Work was completed shortly before the [[Spring]] Equinox 383YE.
The ritual's name is a reference a former [[General|general]] of the [[Summer Storm]], Irontide Skar - the same [[General|general]] referred to in Skar's Strength [[Potion]]. A bold warrior and veteran of many campaigns, Irontide Skar is known as a master of the use of the shield in battle. He is also known to be an adept of the art of pushing forward while defending himself and his allies with a great shield – the “gentle push” of the name. Some magicians involved in the codification of the ritual pondered whether the “Irontide” itself may be a reference to this tactic.
This ritual has some commonality with the much more potent [[Might of the Myrmidon]]. Rather than sparking the potential to be a mighty warrior in a green recruit, however, it empowers them with the much more focused ability to use a shield to its full potential. There is a limit to the effectiveness of the [[Magic|magic]], which is the [[Will|will]] and spirit of the one chosen to bear the [[Enchantment|enchantment]]. While the ritual gently encourages the shieldbearer to seek out [[Opportunities|opportunities]] for [[Heroism|heroism]] and [[Glory|glory]], or to put themselves where their shield [[Will|will]] be of the most value, it cannot turn a sheep into a lion.
Enhancing individuals to make them more capable is the single most important resonance of [[Summer magic]]. The ritual easily exploits the resonance of prowess that runs throughout [[Summer magic|Summer Magic]].
## Performing the Ritual
The [[Magic|magic]] has some similarity to [[Might of the Myrmidon]] and similar [[Rituals|rituals]]. It commonly involves girding the target with a shield – ideally the shield they are to use. There is a strong influence of [[Imperial Orcs]] magical philosophy in parts of the ritual – having the target swear an oath related to how they will use the shield resonates strongly with the magic, as does having a [[Magician|magician]] perform the [[Create Bond|create bond]] incantation to bond the bearer to their shield if it is a [[Magical Item|magical item]].
While much of the focus is on the one who will be [[Enchanted|enchanted]], it is also resonant with the magic involved to name the shield – or give it a name if it is unnamed – and where possible have the bearer speak about why it is an item of [[Worth]] – the [[Imperial Orcs]] concept of items gaining significance through use – or how they intend to use it so that it gains [[Worth|worth]].
Some witches suggest that these ideas resonate strongly with their magical traditional of girding, while Winterfolk scholars draw parallels with the idea of naming and how names have power.
When the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single person, a theurgist suggests that it is resonant to reinforce bonds of [[Loyalty|loyalty]] and mutual respect, on the grounds that the targets will presumably all [[Fight|fight]] together and be responsible for protecting each other. The names of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] known to be legendary warriors such as [[Adelmar the Lion]] may be invoked – although not all are equally appropriate. The magicians codifying the ritual suggest that [[Inga Tarn]] and [[Bolstering Bill]] with their well-known affection for two-handed weapons would be poor choices.
Another suggested method of performing the ritual is to recreate a scene from the life of General Skar, where the recipient is called on to attack one of the contributors who blocks the blow with their sword and strikes the opponent a glancing blow with their shield.
Some Imperial Orc magicians have suggested that it might be resonant to call on the name of Irontide Skar, as if he were an ancestor; others say that it would be unwise or potentially even blasphemous to use the name in this fashion. There is much less concern about referencing the ''Iron Defender'' – the shield gifted by the Imperial Orcs to [[The Throne]] – which can be seen as an iconic item of great worth with a strong resonance to this ritual. Others have also suggested the names of the artifact Pilgrims Shields might be used in a similar fashion.
Any [[Summer]] [[Rune|rune]] resonates with the ritual but [[Verys]] and [[Feresh]] are most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]], the evocation of a ferocious animal such as a bear, badger, or chimera, or the names of [[Cathan Canae]], [[Eleonaris]], or King [[Adamant]] are also appropriate.
