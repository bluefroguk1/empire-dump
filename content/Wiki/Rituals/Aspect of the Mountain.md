## Rules
Season|Summer|20
Urizen Lore
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Military unit]]
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual places an [[Enchantment]] on the target [[Military unit]] that enhances their ability to fight defensively and take advantage of fortified positions. This will increase their effectiveness by 100 military strength when taking the [[Military unit#Defend Fortification|Defend Fortification]] action.
The character who controls the military unit experiences a short-lived [[Roleplaying effects|roleplaying effect]]: you feel an immediate urge to find a location that is significant to you, and to defend it against intruders or trespassers. Your definition of intruders and trespassers may reveal any prejudices you feel against other nations, species, or lineages or may expose a rivalry you feel for another person. You feel a strong urge to challenge such intruders or trespassers, and confronting them feels good and empowering. The effect persists for at least ten minutes after the ritual is complete
Season Duration
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional military units controlled by members of the same [[Banner]]. Each additional military unit increases the magnitude by 15. The character who controls each unit must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This ritual was codified at the Summer 383YE by the people of [[Urizen]] under the guidance of the Ioseph of Phoenix Reach, [[Doyen of the Spires]]. It was the first ritual ever codified under the guidance of the Doyen of the Spires following the restoration of the Heliopticon network in the wake of the Druj invasion of [[Zenith]] and [[Morrow]], and the liberation of [[Spiral]]. It was codified in a single season, primarily due to the additional support provided by refugees from Zenith who had begun new lives in Morrow and Redoubt. In keeping with the unique appointment method of the Doyen of the Spires, the original [[Arcane projection|arcane projection]] was presented by Ioseph of Phoenix Reach to the magicians of Urizen at Anvil during the Spring Equinox 383YE and judged the magical effect the nation should focus its attention on.
This ritual is closely modeled on the more familiar [[Raise the Standard of War]]. It empowers and enhances a warband, granting them strength of will and fighting spirit for the coming season. The ritual has the same resonance for enhancing the fighting spirit of the soldiers affected, making it easier for them to fight against difficult odds and giving them a surge in confidence in their abilities, it urges them to take up a more defensive stand than the more familiar ritual. 
Warriors experiencing the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] gain additional constitution that helps them endure the privations of war more effectively. They also gain a new respect for, and greater understanding of, the defensive accoutrements of war – especially shields and heavy armour. One odd effect of the ritual is that the commander of the warband invariably experiences a powerful urge to find a location and defend it against “trespassers”. This effect is also experienced by the warband – in some cases it is theorised that performing the ritual on soldiers with deep seated prejudices could lead to problems in some circumstances. For example, a Marcher warband already suspicious of briars might find that suspicion enhanced to the point where it promotes undisciplined behaviour.
## Common Elements
This ritual enhances a small military force, using a connection to its leader to spread magic through the entire unit. It is exceptionally common to include a banner or standard that will be used by the target force as a focus for the ritual. A symbol or banner representing the fortification the commander intends their warband to support might also be included.
Unsurprisingly, from the point of view of an [[Astronomancy|astronomancer]], [[The Mountain]] resonates strongly with this ritual – a fortification is a fine symbol of an obstacle that must be overcome by others or that impedes their progress. The ritual also resonates with the imagery and power of [[The Oak]] which teaches that “things endure”. A [[Runesmith]] will find the [[Verys|Rune of Strength]] resonates well with this ritual, while despite the name [[Totem magic#Theurgy|Theurgists]] might include the invocation of paragons or exemplars associated with defending others – [[Inga Tarn]] or [[Bolstering Bill]] are particularly resonant. A [[Totem magic#Goetia|goeticist]] may call on the name of Summer eternals such as [[Cathan Canae]] and [[Adamant]], both powers associated with unyielding defence.
A strong element to include would be the girding of the military leader in the style of the people of Dawn; the sound of martial horns or drums; and the presence of warriors from the same nation as the warband or the fortification as witnesses.
