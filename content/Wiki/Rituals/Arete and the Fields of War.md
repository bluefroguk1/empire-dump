[[Urizen]] Lore
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2  Target Character
[[Enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains the ability to make a single call each day depending on the weapon they are wielding when they make that call. If they are wielding a one-handed weapon or one-handed spear they may call CLEAVE. If they are wielding a polearm they may call STRIKEDOWN. If they are wielding a great weapon they may call IMPALE. Note that this ritual does not give them any particular ability to wield a weapon covered by the weapon master skill
While benefitting from medium or heavy armour the target gains an additional rank of endurance. That is, the character must be wearing medium or heavy armour that covers the majority of the torso and at least one other location; valid locations are the head (with a helm), the arms and the legs, or you may cover half of your arms and legs.
As long as the enchantment lasts they may respond to any effect that would make them afraid or doubtful by remaining focused on their immediate goals.
While under the effect of this enchantment the target experiences a Roleplaying effect: you are increasingly interested in military affairs and preparation for Fighting. You want to hone not only your own martial Skills but the martial skills of those around you. Furthermore you become very interested in the strategies proposed by the military council and the Generals of [[The Empire]] wanting to discuss their plans and offer your own [[Insight]] wherever possible.
