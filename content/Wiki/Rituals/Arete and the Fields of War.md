## Rules
Season|Day|16
Urizen Lore
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2  Target Character
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains the ability to make a single call each day depending on the weapon they are wielding when they make that call. If they are wielding a [[Weapons %26 armour#One-handed Weapons|one-handed weapon]] or [[Weapons %26 armour#One-handed Spear|one-handed spear]] they may call [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]]. If they are wielding a [[Weapons %26 armour#Polearms|polearm]] they may call [[Calls#STRIKEDOWN|STRIKEDOWN]]. If they are wielding a [[Weapons %26 armour#Great weapons|great weapon]] they may call [[Calls#IMPALE|IMPALE]]. Note that this ritual does not give them any particular ability to wield a weapon covered by the [[Combat skills#Weapon Master|weapon master]] skill
While benefitting from [[Weapons %26 armour#Medium Armour|medium]] or [[Weapons %26 armour#Heavy Armour|heavy]] armour the target gains an additional rank of [[Combat skills#Endurance|endurance]]. That is, the character must be wearing medium or heavy armour that covers the majority of the torso and at least one other location; valid locations are the head (with a helm), the arms and the legs, or you may cover half of your arms and legs.
As long as the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] lasts they may respond to any effect that would make them afraid or doubtful by remaining focused on their immediate goals.
While under the effect of this [[Enchantment|enchantment]] the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: you are increasingly interested in military affairs and preparation for fighting. You want to hone not only your own martial skills but the martial skills of those around you. Furthermore you become very interested in the strategies proposed by the military council and the generals of the Empire wanting to discuss their plans and offer your own insight wherever possible.
