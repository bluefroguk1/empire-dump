## Description
Passion lies at the heart of the Night [[Realm]], and there is much more to passion than lust or desire. This ritual fans the flames of greatness that lie inside everyone, encouraging them to undertake heroic deeds. As with crafted items such as the [[Triumphant Blade]] or a suit of [[Runeplate]] it is most effective when it is used to enchant someone who either already possesses a reserve of passion and heroic drive, or who is armed with a Butcher's Cleaver or similar item that can be 'powered' by the ritual.
Some ritualists view the ability to strike mighty blows or shrug off dreadful injury to be a secondary importance next to the effect the ritual has on the spirit of a target. Otherwise meek individuals can be enCouraged to match the fury of a battle-ready [[Kohan]], while a Dawnish Yeofolk may find the spell gives them the confidence they need to seek out their test of mettle. Even without other uses, the ability to steel the will and resist outside influences is sometimes useful in its own right; anyone can benefit from the ability to overcome malign spiritual forces, even if it is only for a short time.
Among the [[Urizen]] this ritual is often called ''Harness the Cold Flame''. In keeping with their study of poise, the ritual involves encouraging a passionate, emotional response then helping the target to capture that intense emotion and harness it to their will. Urizen under the influence of this ritual do not display their emotions as freely as others, but are much more likely to actively seek out things that offend them to confront with the force of their banked passions.
## Common Elements
This ritual often involves consuming a drink, especially spiced or mUlled wine, or consuming a narcotic of some sort. Fire is a common element; weapons may be wielded, especially as part of a dance; drumming, which begins at a slow tempo and accelerates or the singing of energetic, loud songs also work well with this ritual.
Some ritualists, especially among the [[Imperial Orcs]] and Winterfolk try to get the target worked up by attacking their beliefs or things they care about, although this can backfire (and it is rarely effective if the target knows in advance that this method is to be used). In [[The Brass Coast]] and [[Varushka]] the target is encouraged to join in energetic dancing or drumming, while in [[The Marches]] or [[Highguard]] the ritual may be performed at the end of a tiring sporting event or physical context. Anything that gets the heart pounding and the blood racing can make a powerful adjunct to this ritual.
Symbols of [[Pride]], [[Ambition]] and [[Courage]] are often used, as are scenes that inSpire or exalt the audience; the rune [[Zorech]] is an obvious fit for this ritual. The [[Eternal]] [[Janon]], the ''shadowed fire'' is often evoked during the performance of this ritual, especially through impassioned drumming accompanied by frenzied dancing.
