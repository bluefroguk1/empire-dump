### Effects
This ritual places an [[Enchantment]] on the soldiers of a campaign army that allows them to make and execute strategic and tactical plans more effectively. The target campaign army gains a boost to its [[Combat|combat]] ability equivalent to 2,000 additional soldiers but ''only'' for purposes of determining victory - that is, the army does not inflict additional [[Casualties|casualties]]. Army Strength Ritual
The [[General|general]] used to focus this ritual experiences a short-lived [[Roleplaying effect]]: ''you are immediately made aware of every single soldier and piece of equipment in the army, their status, readiness and prowess. This rush of information may be overpowering - it might knock you off their feet, stun you for a minute or two, or even cause a loss of consciousness.''
Thereafter, as long as the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] persists, the [[General|general]] experiences a less overwhelming version of this roleplaying effect: ''You are supernaturally aware of the status of the soldiers in your army, and their morale. You can bring to mind their names and origins, as well as gain an awareness of their capabilities and equipment. When talking about military matters it is easy and natural to drop details such as these into your conversation.''
Season Duration
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional armies from the same Empire. The [[General|general]] responsible for each army must be present throughout the ritual. Each additional target increases the magnitude by 60.
## Description
This ritual empowers and enhances an army, using the Imperial general as focus. Every soldier in the target army gains an increased awareness of their role within the army, and the needs of the army as a whole. Officers are aware of the status and needs of the soldiers who [[Fight|fight]] under them, and gain a much greater understanding of the purpose and goal of strategic and tactical decisions. Captains and commanders receive an even more wide-ranging awareness, being able to understand and collate information about enemy movements and strength, the effects of terrain and weather, and the probabilities of success for any given maneuver. The army does not become infallible, but it gains an unparalleled ability to work as a single unit and to make informed decisions about how best to proceed. This clarity extends to interactions both with other campaign armies and with soldiers who join the army later, helping them to integrate and allowing the commanders to make reasonable decisions about their abilities.
On [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], warriors under this [[Enchantment]] [[Fight|fight]] cohesively, and sometimes display a supernatural awareness of their surroundings, their fellow soldiers, and the overall progress of the battle.
When used to affect multiple generals, it draws power from a larger shared strategy. Even if the generals are not participating in the same campaign, they share an awareness of the situation in the other theatres of [[War|war]] that have a bearing - no matter how tenuous - on their own campaign. Including two generals who despise each other and refuse to co-operate may cause the ritual to fail completely.
This ritual is also sometimes called ''Ascent of the Pyramid'', a reference to the [[Day]] [[Eternal]] [[Sinokenon]] who is sometimes invoked during this ritual for its ability to perceive the many parts that make up a whole, and to assist in unifying those disparate agencies towards a single aim. More often, it is associated with the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Zakalwe]] whose philosophies of warfare are often expounded while the ritual is performed, and who is known to offer boons that [[Empower|empower]] its performance.
## Common Elements
This ritual enhances a campaign army, and the general of the target army serves as a vital focus for delivering the [[Magic|magic]]. It is common to include a [[Banner|banner]] or standard that [[Will|will]] be used by the target force as a focus for the ritual. Other common elements include the invocation of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Vigilance]] and [[Loyalty]], as well as the names of Day eternals associated with information such as [[Kimus]] and [[Sinokenon]] but most especially [[Zakalwe]]. Other elements include girding or crowning [[The Military|the military]] leader, the rhythmic beat of military drums, the presence of warriors from the same nation as the target as witnesses. Another common element is the use of crystals and mirrors to reflect parts of the ritual, slowly moving them towards a single location to symbolise the coming together of disparate elements.
The [[Rune|rune]] of thought, [[Aesh]], is favoured for this ritual as are the [[Autumn]] [[Runes|runes]] [[Queros]] and [[Lann]]. The [[Constellations|constellations]] of [[The Chain]] and [[The Three Sisters]] might be invoked, as might the [[Characters|characters]] of [[The Captain]] or [[The Doctor]].
