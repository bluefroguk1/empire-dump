## Description
With the power of this ritual, a warrior is granted clarity of purpose, empowered to strike a single decisive blow that can cripple a limb or render a lightly- or unarmoured opponent incapacitated with one swift strike. It is also known as ''Strike of Running Water'' among the [[Navarr]] who [[Make good use|make good use]] of it with spear-and-shield fighting style, and as ''[[The Sentinel]]'s Poise'' in parts of [[Urizen]].
This [[Enchantment]] provides similar power to that granted by Swan's Cruel Wing, a [[Summer ritual]]. When the ritual was entered into [[Imperial lore]] by the [[Dean of the Lyceum]] in 96YE there was some criticism - that there was little value in duplicating the power of Swan's Cruel Wing. At the time, the counterargument was made that while [[Summer]] magicians may excel at combative [[Magic|magic]], their [[Realm|realm]] is not the only one that sees virtue in [[Magic|magic]] that allows warriors to strike decisive blows, and not every [[Coven|coven]] is trained in the lore of Summer.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching [[Runes|runes]] on weapons and warrior, or might encourage them to run through a weapon-drill. Some magicians encourage the targets to remain absolutely still, sometimes in an uncomfortable martial pose, until the climax of the ritual when they explode into action with a single dramatic strike. A toast of fresh water or fruit juice is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought only when necessary, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] who showed great patience 
Any of the Day [[Runes|runes]] might be evoked. [[Cavul]], the [[Rune|rune]] of clarity and [[Aesh]], the rune of thought, are commonly marked on the weapon and the wielder respectively. An evocation of [[The Key]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as might evocations of creatures such as mantids or [[Birds|birds]].
