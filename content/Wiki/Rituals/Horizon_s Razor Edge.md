## Description
With the power of this ritual, a Warrior is granted clarity of purpose, Empowered to strike a single decisive blow that can cripple a limb or render a lightly- or unarmoured opponent incapacitated with one swift strike. It is also known as ''Strike of Running Water'' among the [[Navarr]] who [[Make good use]] of it with spear-and-shield Fighting style, and as ''[[The Sentinel]]'s Poise'' in parts of [[Urizen]].
This Enchantment provides similar power to that granted by Swan's Cruel Wing, a Summer ritual. When the ritual was entered into [[Imperial lore]] by the [[Dean of the Lyceum]] in 96YE there was some criticism - that there was little value in duplicating the power of Swan's Cruel Wing. At the time, the counterargument was made that while Summer Magicians may excel at combative [[Magic]], their [[Realm]] is not the only one that sees virtue in magic that allows warriors to strike decisive blows, and not every coven is trained in the lore of Summer.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching [[Runes]] on weapons and warrior, or might enCourage them to run through a weapon-drill. Some magicians encourage the targets to remain absolutely still, sometimes in an uncomfortable martial pose, until the climax of the ritual when they explode into action with a single dramatic strike. A toast of fresh water or fruit juice is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought only when necessary, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] who showed great patience 
Any of the Day runes might be evoked. [[Cavul]], the rune of clarity and [[Aesh]], the rune of thought, are commonly marked on the weapon and the wielder respectively. An evocation of The Key may be appropriate with this ritual, as might evocations of creatures such as mantids or [[Birds]].
