## Rules
Season|Summer|22
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target can use either [[Heroic skills#Stay with Me|stay with me]] or [[Heroic skills#Get it together|get it together]] a total of three times each day, without needing to know the skills or spend any [[Heroic skills#Hero points|hero points]]. The target can choose which skill to use each time they use the ability, up to a maximum of three total uses in any given day.
In addition, when exposed to any roleplaying effect that might cause them to be humble before, or deferential towards, another person they can instead respond with lordly confidence and noble pride. 
The target also experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: You feel a drive to take charge, get things done and assume responsibility for others; you have a strong sense of ''noblesse oblige''. This effect is exceptionally pronounced for characters of the [[Changeling]] lineage.

## Description
This ritual celebrates the majestic, glorious nobility of the Summer realm. The Summer eternals often inspire awe in mortals, and this ritual gives the target a fragment of that power. With words and charisma, the target can help their allies regain their fighting spirit, or even drive away the spectre of death from a badly injured ally. ''[[Mantle of Lordly Might]]'' lets them wear their nobility as a mantle to inspire others. The ritual is often used to provide a battlefield commander with the ability to directly aid their troops.
In some parts of the Empire this ritual is called ''Mantle of the Bard'' (or ''Troubadour'', ''Scop'', or ''Banner-bearer'' as appropriate) and often serves to enhance the natural abilities of such an individual to bolster their allies. It is interesting to note that unlike many other [[Enchantment|enchantments]], it is not possible to perform this ritual on more than one target simultaneously.
## Common Elements
This ritual often involves anointing the target in some way, but most commonly involves placing a crown on their head or a mantle around their shoulders. Symbols of [[Pride]], [[Loyalty]], or [[Ambition]] are often used, as are trappings of nobility and heroism. For example, a [[Dawn|Dawnish]] noble might have a jewelled circlet ceremonially placed on their brow while being garbed in a fine surcote or cloak, while a [[The Marches|Marcher]] steward is more likely to be given a crown of grass, a sheaf of corn, a mug of beer, a bowl of grain, and a symbol of the Imperial Faith to represent the way that the power to lead in the Marches comes from the people themselves. 
The [[Feresh|Rune of Majesty]] is commonly used with this ritual, as is an evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]]; animals that represent pride or majesty such as eagles or lions; and legendary or heraldic beasts such as [[Legendary beasts#Gryphons|gryphons]], [[Legendary beasts#Chimera|chimerae]], and [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]]; or the characters of [[The Prince]] or [[The Bishop]].
