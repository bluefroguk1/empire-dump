## Description
Where [[Embrace the Living Flame]] spurs the passion at the heart of a hero, ''[[Still Waters, Running Deep]]'' encourages them to look at the world around them and see how it might be changed for the better. All the stories of [[Heroes|heroes]] contain a seed of change, claim the [[Kallavesi]] [[Mystics|mystics]] who first made extensive use of this ritual. Even the best villains seek to enact change; the difference between a good person and a bad person is the nature of the change they wish to enact, As with crafted items such as the [[Ironbrand Thorn]] or a [[Runemark Shirt]] it is most effective when it is used to enchant someone who either already possesses a reserve of passion and heroic drive, or who is armed with a Labyrinth's [[Gate]] or similar item that can be 'powered' by the ritual.
Some ritualists view the ability to inflict savage wounds or restore fighting spirit to be a secondary importance next to the effect the ritual has on the spirit of a target. When they focus on making the world ''better'' in some way, a person becomes more like a legendary hero, more likely to achieve timeless deeds that [[Will|will]] inspire those who see them or hear about them - potentially for many generations. Some students of [[Night]] lore see this relatively simple ritual as a way to create a more profound change. In [[Urizen]] especially, the ability for one person to inspire others to action is very powerful. Even without other uses, the ability to steel the [[Will|will]] and resist outside influences is sometimes useful in its own right; anyone can benefit from the ability to overcome malign spiritual forces, even if it is only for a short time.
The [[Kallavesi]], [[Imperial Orcs]] and Highborn who use this ritual often see it as creating a bond between the target and a hero of the past, ancestral spirit or even past life. Orcs in particular have spoken of feeling more connected to their ancestors when they are under the effect of this ritual (for good or ill).
## Common Elements
This ritual often involves consuming a drink, especially spiced or mulled wine, or consuming a narcotic of some sort. Fire is a common element; weapons may be wielded, especially as part of a dance; drumming, which begins at a slow tempo and accelerates or the singing of energetic, loud songs also work well with this ritual.
Imperial orc ritualists often include items of [[Worth]] taken from inspirational ancestors, to try and draw those spirits to aid the target, even if they are not an orc. Highborn ritualists may speak of past lives, or inspirational [[Paragons and Exemplars]] as well as heroic figures from stories and [[History|history]]. Kallavesi mystics evoke the spirits of ''those who sleep in [[Kallavesa]]'', and often include a draught brewed from swamp-water as part of the ritual. Other ritualists follow similar themes - naming inspirational figures, especially relatives or members of the same [[Noble House]], [[Family]] or household  
Symbols of [[Pride]] and [[Ambition]] are often used, as are scenes that inspire or exalt the audience; the [[Rune|rune]] [[Zorech]] is often used with this ritual, but [[Tykonus]] is a close second. The [[Eternal]] [[Janon]], the ''shadowed fire'' is often evoked during the performance of this ritual, especially through impassioned drumming accompanied by frenzied dancing.
