## Description
This [[Enchantment]] is among one of the best-known [[Summer]] [[Rituals|rituals]]. Along with [[Swift Leaping Hare]], [[Hammer of Thunder]] and [[Strength of the Bull]] it provides a [[Coven|coven]] with the ability to select the right enchantment to enhance any band of warriors.
''The Swan's Cruel Wing'' is also known as ''The Hungry Blade'' (or axe, or what-have-you), or ''The Dolorous Blow''. It has several advantages over other enchantments of Summer because almost anyone can benefit from it; there is no requirement to have mastered a specific weapon to strike a devastating blow.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching [[Runes|runes]] on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. A toast is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought and triumphed against great odds, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 
Any of the Summer [[Runes|runes]] might be evoked, but [[Tykonus]], the [[Rune|rune]] of victory, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of horses, unicorns and dragons.
