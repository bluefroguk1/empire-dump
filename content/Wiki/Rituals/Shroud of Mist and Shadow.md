## Description
This ritual lacks the brute force power of [[Raise the Standard of War]], but what it lacks in might it makes up for in versatility; it is also easier to cast on a number of targets at once. The [[Enchanted|enchanted]] military force is shrouded in a veil of concealment. Usually this veil takes the form of a natural phenomenon such as mist or rain, but when such a force is active synchronicity conspires to help them remain undetected until the last moment. Stray winds or sudden spills extinguish lanterns or lamps; odd noises distract sentries or patrols; a guard might sneeze at just the right moment to cover a careless footfall. It may also occasionally be more overtly supernatural; a warrior might manage to hide behind a birch sapling for a few vital moments; a trained scout might mistake heavy boot-prints for deer tracks; a bobbing [[Witch|witch]]-light might lead a [[Military unit|military unit]] into an advantageous position from which to launch an ambush.
On [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], warriors under this [[Enchantment]] are often able to attack from ambush, giving them a momentary advantage. Over the duration of an entire battle the protection of the ''[[Shroud of Mist and Shadow|shroud of mist and shadow]]'' tends to even out, but in swift engagements it can give a decisive advantage. When a [[Military unit|military unit]] partakes of paid work, the shroud helps them remain unobtrusive until they need to act, making it especially popular with [[Business|business]] owners looking to hire some additional security. It also has obvious effectiveness when a unit raids a bandit encampment, or strikes out into dangerous [[Territory|territory]] in search of [[Adventure|adventure]] and riches.
## Common Elements
This ritual enhances a small military force, using a connection to its leader to spread [[Magic|magic]] through the entire unit. It is common to include a banner, standard or even occasionally a musical instrument that [[Will|will]] be used by the target force as a focus for the ritual. On occasion the banner is shrouded in white or black cloth to hide the insignia, and any heraldic devices or livery on shields or surcoats are likewise concealed when the ritual is performed. 
Other common elements include the invocation of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Vigilance]] and [[Wisdom]], or of folk [[Heroes|heroes]] known for their cleverness, cunning or subtlety. Other elements include girding a military leader in robes, cowl, veils or masks; the quiet sound of disturbing [[Music|music]], dim lanterns moved in seemingly random patterns; the [[Burning|burning]] of incense to create clouds of smoke that represent mist, and the presence of blindfolded warriors as 'witnesses'.
The [[Rune]] of Mystery, [[Wyr]], is often included.
