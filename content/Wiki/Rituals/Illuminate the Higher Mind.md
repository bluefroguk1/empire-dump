## Description
''[[Illuminate the Higher Mind]]'' provides [[Spellcasting]] ability. Like [[Ascendance of the Highest Mind]] and [[Transcendent Mastery]] imprints precise knowledge of how the incantation is performed, its effect and limitations, into the mind of the target. By using that knowledge they can perform the spell 'by rote'.
It is very useful for allowing a coven to expand their versatility; a common use is to allow members to perform useful spells such as [[Heal]], [[Empower]], or [[Purify]] that might be useful in a coming battle. Its use is not limited to coven-mates however; some covens and magicians make a point of mastering as many incantations as possible, selling the ability to perform a useful spell to other magicians. For example, a coven might temporarily teach a band of Dawnish [[War]]-witches how to perform the [[Venom]] spell when they must enter an area infested with Vallornspawn husks, or to give a [[Navarr]] magician-messenger the ability to perform the [[Night Pouch]] incantation to help them conceal valuable documents.
While it is often used by a coven, it is a simple enough ritual that a single scholar of [[Day magic]] might perform it; it might even be improVised if there is enough need. It is slightly more useful to a coven merely because there is likely to be a larger number of spells available among the contributors.
## Common Elements
The ritual usually involves a symbolic transfer of knowledge between the character or characters who know the chosen spell, and the recipients. Often this mimics the master/apprentice or student/teacher relationships, and sometimes it involves the casting of the spell to be taught. 
Tokens marked with the rune [[Aesh]] may change hands, and there may be a symbolic (or very real) payment between student and teacher, especially in a Freeborn or League ritual. The Navarr may enact a merging or exchange of blood, but they are as likely to pass written scrolls from one to another.
In [[Varushka]] this ritual often involves a spoken oath from the recipient to use the spell granted responsibly; an oath which is often taken very seriously by the magician who is the source of the spell knowledge. Among Imperial orc warcasters a combination of copying the incantation down and an oath to use the spell for the good of the legion may be combined (often overseen by an oathwright). Some [[Imperial Orcs]] ritualists call on an ancestor to inSpire the target with the chosen spell, but this is rarely attempted unless the target is a shaman. In a similar way, some Highborn magisters seek to inspire their target so that one of their past lives may awaken enough to let them channel the chosen spell.
