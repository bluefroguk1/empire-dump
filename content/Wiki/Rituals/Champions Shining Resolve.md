## Description
Great deeds - if not necessarily ''heroic'' deeds - are at the heart of the Summer [[Realm]]. This ritual functions a little like the [[Empower]] incantation, but is even more versatile. As with crafted items such as the [[Triumphant Blade]] or a suit of [[Runeplate]] it is most effective when it is used to enchant someone who either already possesses a reserve of passion and heroic drive, or who is armed with a Butcher's Cleaver or similar item that can be 'powered' by the ritual.
Even without other uses, the ability to steel the will and resist outside influences is sometimes useful in its own right; anyone can benefit from the ability to overcome malign spiritual forces, even if it is only for a short time.
The name of the ritual is the subject of some controversy. Some Magicians claim it is ''Champion's Shining Resolve'', intending it to be used on one or two glorious and heroic Warriors. Other magicians claim it is ''Champions' Shining Resolve'', meaning it is most appropriate to use it on multiple warriors so that all can benefit. The Highborn and [[Urizen]] magicians who make a study of such things suggest that one can learn something about one's peers by asking them what they think the ritual is called.
## Common Elements
This ritual often involves [[Anointing]] the target in some way, often with wine or blood. It may also include a symbolic crowning with green leaves or (especially in [[The Marches]]) a circlet of woven corn or grass. The names of heroic individuals (especially powerful ancestors, even for targets who are not themselves [[Imperial Orcs]]) or particularly inspirational [[Paragons and Exemplars]] are another common element, as are symbols of [[Pride]]. 
When green iron is used during the ritual, especially by a Dawnish coven, the ingots are often pressed against and into the weapons and armour of the target, often as part of a formal act of girding the target.
Any of the Summer [[Runes]] might be evoked, but [[Feresh]], the rune of majesty, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as may evocations of Horses; animals that represent pride or majesty such as eagles or lions; and legendary or heraldic beasts such as gryphons, chimerae and unicorns.
