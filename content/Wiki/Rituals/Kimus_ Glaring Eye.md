## Rules
Season|Day|19
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must have the [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] skill.
During the ritual the target must be marked on one hand with a depiction of the rune [[Sular]], the rune [[Ophis]], or an open eye.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
During the ritual, one of the target's palms must be painted, marked or tattooed with the [[Sular]] tune, the rune [[Ophis]], or a direct depiction of an open eye.
Whenever the target casts the [[Repel]] spell, they may use it on two targets instead of one. They have only 10 seconds to deliver the second call of REPEL. They can only make this call if the hand marked with the eye is free and open and the symbol is visible; it cannot be in a pocket, gloved or otherwise concealed; nor can it be in use holding anything (including a buckler or shield) or wielding another weapon or implement. The only exception is that a character with the [[Magical skills#Battle Mage|battle mage]] skill ''can'' use this ability when wielding a [[Weapons %26 armour#Staff|staff]].
If at any point the image on the palm is disrupted (such as by being washed away in rain), the effects of the ritual immediately end.

## Description
This ritual allows the target to channel mystic force, provided they are prepared to honour a pact with the Day [[Eternal]] [[Kimus]] to bear its sigil, and present it when they invoke the power to drive their opponents away. This ritual is not massively popular - the ability it provides comes at the cost of some versatility - but for the scholars of Day it can sometimes provide much-needed battlefield effectiveness at minimal cost. 
The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] does not care ''how'' the magician performs the [[Repel]] spell, only that they do. They might wield it through personal knowledge of the spell, or make use of a magic item such as a [[Storm Sceptre]], [[Stormweaver]], or [[Pugilist's Shillelagh]]. As soon as the spell is cast, it brings with it an echo, or resonance, that allows the magician to unleash a second identical effect on a second target within reach of their implement. The resonance fades quickly - there are only a few seconds to unleash the second spell - but for a battle mage in the thick of combat it can prove a great adjunct to their martial prowess.
The ritual is sometimes cast with the use of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]] as well as, or instead of, crystal mana. Such materials not only resonate with magical force (they are a major  component of many weapons related to driving foes away, shattering items, or knocking opponents down), but the tempest jade also has a resonance for divination and detection making it doubly valuable, and appealing, to Kimus.
## Common Elements
In addition to the mark on the hand, the rune [[Ophis]] is often marked on the rod or staff of the target.
