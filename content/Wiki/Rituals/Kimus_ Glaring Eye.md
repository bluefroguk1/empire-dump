## Rules
Season|Day|19
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must have the [[Magician|magician]] skill.
During the ritual the target must be marked on one hand with a depiction of the [[Rune|rune]] [[Sular]], the rune [[Ophis]], or an open eye.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
During the ritual, one of the target's palms must be [[Painted|painted]], marked or tattooed with the [[Sular]] tune, the rune [[Ophis]], or a direct depiction of an open eye.
Whenever the target casts the [[Repel]] spell, they may use it on two targets instead of one. They have only 10 seconds to deliver the second call of [[Repel|REPEL]]. They can only make this call if the hand marked with the eye is free and open and the symbol is visible; it cannot be in a pocket, gloved or otherwise concealed; nor can it be in use holding anything (including a buckler or shield) or wielding another weapon or implement. The only exception is that a character with the battle [[Mage|mage]] skill ''can'' use this ability when wielding a staff.
If at any point the image on the palm is disrupted (such as by being washed away in rain), the effects of the ritual immediately end.

## Description
This ritual allows the target to channel [[Mystic|mystic]] force, provided they are prepared to honour a pact with the [[Day]] [[Eternal]] [[Kimus]] to bear its sigil, and present it when they invoke the power to drive their opponents away. This ritual is not massively popular - the ability it provides comes at the [[Cost|cost]] of some versatility - but for the scholars of Day it can sometimes provide much-needed battlefield effectiveness at minimal [[Cost|cost]]. 
The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] does not care ''how'' the magician performs the [[Repel]] spell, only that they do. They might wield it through personal knowledge of the spell, or make use of a [[Magic|magic]] item such as a [[Storm Sceptre]], [[Stormweaver]], or Pugilist's Shillelagh. As soon as the spell is cast, it brings with it an echo, or resonance, that allows the magician to unleash a second identical effect on a second target within reach of their implement. The resonance fades quickly - there are only a few seconds to unleash the second spell - but for a battle [[Mage|mage]] in the thick of [[Combat|combat]] it can prove a great adjunct to their martial prowess.
The ritual is sometimes cast with the use of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] as well as, or instead of, crystal mana. Such [[Materials|materials]] not only resonate with magical force (they are a major  component of many weapons related to driving foes away, shattering items, or knocking opponents down), but the tempest jade also has a resonance for divination and detection making it doubly valuable, and appealing, to [[Kimus]].
## Common Elements
In addition to the mark on the hand, the rune [[Ophis]] is often marked on the rod or staff of the target.
