Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Military unit]]
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual summons a contingent of around a dozen undying warriors from the grim legion of the [[Eternal]] [[Kaela]] and binds them to fight alongside a mortal [[Military unit]].
The military unit gains a significant bonus to its effectiveness when it is [[Military unit#Support Army|assigned]] to support a [[Imperial army|campaign army]]. Military Unit Strength|100|5
The character who controls the military unit experiences a short-lived [[Roleplaying effect]]: they are suddenly reminded of every time in the past that they, or someone they care about, has been close to death (or actually died), and receive a premonition of their eventual demise.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional military units controlled by members of the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional military unit increases the magnitude by 15. The character who controls each unit must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
The grim legion of the [[Eternal]] [[Kaela]] is made up of mortal warriors who have accepted her boon of endless existence. This ritual conjures perhaps a dozen of her troops, often an experienced unit of soldiers who have fought together before - often for centuries. They are armed and usually heavily armoured, and they fight with implacable, hopeless determination. More importantly, perhaps, they cannot be killed. They shrug off wounds that would kill a mortal, quickly recovering from their injuries. It is common to see one of these terrifying, silent soldiers fighting with the broken remains of arrows protruding from chest or belly.
The undying warriors do not socialise with the other soldiers in the [[Military unit]]. They require neither food nor drink, and minimal sleep. They have little conversation, and efforts to strike up friendships are coldly rebuffed. At the end of the season, the grim legionary knows they will be returning to the Realm of Winter. By the time they are sent forth again, it is likely that every soldier they fight alongside will have been dead for decades. Furthermore, many of those warriors who took Kaela's gift were already embittered by decades of war and death. They take little joy in life, because transitory pleasures are nothing compared to life's assured continuance.
At the end of the season, or if one of the warriors is injured so badly that they can no longer continue to fight, they simply march away. Nobody has successfully followed the departing warriors, but it is believed they pass through or into a [[Regio]] of Winter and return to the domain of their mistress.
This ritual is not popular in the Empire, but its practical application means that it sees some use. Few [[Dawn|Dawnish]] nobles are prepared to fight along the grim legion for long - they are a reminder that ultimately war is a grim business and that there are many for whom glory is fleeting. Likewise, the [[Highguard|Highborn]] champions find the undying soldier distasteful - and more than a few priests claim that they are not, cannot be, mortal warriors but rather are eternal spirits in the guise of human warriors. The ritual sees the most use in [[The Marches]], [[Varushka]], and among the [[Navarr]], simply because the folk of these nations need little reminder that war is a dark, bloody, muddy, and often ultimately thankless business.
This ritual is also sometimes called ''Raise the Tattered Banner'', a reference to the Summer ritual [[Raise the Standard of War]] - and to the torn and battered pennants some of the undying warriors fly...
## Common Elements
This ritual issues a summons to beings from the Realm of Winter. They do not appear immediately, but arrive to fight alongside the target [[Military unit]] within a few days. The ritual usually involves an invocation to [[Kaela]], who commands the grim legion. Common elements include the naming of dead or legendary warriors, especially any who are known to serve in the grim legion. The trappings of death and war are often intermingled - a [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] captain might be wrapped in a black robe, while any target might wear a shroud or other funeral mantle, over their armour. Other elements may include [[Dawn Hearth Magic#Girding|girding]] the military leader; crowning them symbolically, often with ivory or bone; the sound of martial horns or drums, and the presence of warriors from the same nation as the target as silent witnesses. Like many Winter [[Rituals|rituals]], music is often brooding and unsettling. In many [[Rituals|rituals]], the leader of the target legion offers a symbolic payment to Kaela and her warriors, often in the form of spilt wine or blood, or the scattering of coins which are left in the mud where they fall. Tattered or torn banners are often raised, especially those which have seen a great deal of use on a battlefield.
The [[Yoorn|Rune of Ending]] is often evoked with this ritual. The rune [[Tykonus]] is ''never'' used with this ritual; the ritual will apparently fail outright if this rune is visible on the person of any of the ritualists or their target.
