## Rules
Season|Autumn|19
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must have the  magician skill.
[[Enchantment]] 
### Effects
When the target swift casts the [[Mend]] spell, they need only spend 1 mana rather than the usual 2 mana. The target does not gain any additional knowledge of, or ability to cast, the mend spell if they do not know it.
The target also experiences a Roleplaying effect: you feel an urge to touch and handle crafted items. Discovering how an item is put together, or exploring its physical characteristics, makes you feel relaxed and focused.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same coven. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 15. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
This ritual employs the Autumn [[Realm]]'s resonance for crafted items, allowing a magician to restore sundered weapons and Shattered shields with great alacrity and without risk of interruption. The enchantment provides no additional ability to actually ''cast'' the mend spell; the target must already have mastered that incantation, or possess an item such as a Runesmith's Gavel that allows them to swift cast the ritual.
The ritual does ''not'' [[Empower]] an item such as a [[Redsteel Chisel]] to allow a magician to swift cast the mend spell.
Some magicians describe being [[Enchanted]] with this ritual as exhausting. They talk about experiencing a slowed perception of time when they begin to cast their mend spell, and describe the [[Magic]] as a "leaden weight" that they must work twice as hard to move as when performing the spell without the benefit of the enchantment. Some Marcher magicians likened using this enchantment to getting a stubborn ox to plow a field - as if the magic itself were surly at the attempt to make it flow more quickly. From the point of view of the observer, however, the magic of the spell is raised and released with great alacrity - but many magicians who endure this enchantment are physically exhausted once they leave [[The Battlefield]], and more than one has collapsed into a deep sleep once danger is past. By contrast, [[Briar]] magicians who use the spell tend to report enjoying the sensation of having to "wrestle" with their magic, and are invariably left fUll of beans after extended use of the power the ritual grants.
The effect of this ritual has obvious application in dangerous situations; it allows a magician to repair the weapons and shields of their allies without risk of interruption, and without potentially requiring a Warrior still engaged with the foe to drop out of line. runesmiths in particular appreciate the enchanted alacrity the ritual provides when it comes to swiftly restoring magical weapons or shields whose properties are otherwise unavailable if they are broken. Some martially inclined magicians, especially among the [[Urizen]] or the [[War]] witches of [[Dawn]] are able to use the Enchantment to keep their own shields, weapons, rods, and staffs intact in the face of destructive opponents.
## Common Elements
The trappings of the artisan are common elements used with this ritual, as are ingots and measures of special [[Materials]]. Washing the hands with water or wine is common, as are invocations using the names of famous or legendary crafters or the [[Eternal]] [[Estavus]]. [[Runes]] such as the Rune of Mastery or the Rune of Thought may also be evoked - the latter in its aspect as the rune that is concerned with education and mental Skills.
