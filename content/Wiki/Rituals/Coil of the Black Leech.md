## Rules
Season|Winter|20
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must possess the magician skill. 
[[Enchantment]]
### Effects
Whenever the target casts the [[Weakness]] spell and strikes a target, they immediately regain up to three lost hits. The ritual does not grant the target any ability to ''cast'' the weakness spell.
While under this Enchantment, the target experiences a Roleplaying effect: whenever they gain hits due to this enchantment, they feel a rush of pleasure. Once they have used this ability once, they feel a constant urge to use it again even when they are not injured.
Season Duration
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same coven. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 14. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
This vampiric ritual takes advantage of [[The Way]] the Weakness spell works to revitalise the caster when they strike a foe. It brings with it a dangerous, gnawing hunger to experience the pleasant taste of another's strength.  A cautionary tale suggests that the twisted, acCursed leech-priests of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] were created using a variant of this ritual, or fell into the clutches of an [[Eternal]] of Winter after their reliance on this [[Magic]] became too pronounced.
This enchantment is sometimes coupled with the use of an [[Agramant]]'s Bargain or a similarly [[Enchanted]] implement. The magic also has an obvious synergy with the [[Splintering Gorget]] [[Mage]] armour.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes leeches, bats and other creatures that feed on the blood of the living. They may shed blood into a goblet of sweet wine for the target to drink or offer gifts or tokens that represent the power to take strength from others. The [[Runes]] [[Kyrop]] and [[Naeve]] are commonly evoked, and some magicians favour the name of Agramant or even [[Sorin]] (whose philosophy of growth through suffering seems a peripheral match for this ritual).
