Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must possess the [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] skill. 
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
Whenever the target casts the [[Weakness]] spell and strikes a target, they immediately regain up to three lost hits. The ritual does not grant the target any ability to ''cast'' the weakness spell.
While under this [[Enchantment]], the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: whenever they gain hits due to this [[Enchantment|enchantment]], they feel a rush of pleasure. Once they have used this ability once, they feel a constant urge to use it again even when they are not injured.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 14. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
This vampiric ritual takes advantage of the way the [[Weakness]] spell works to revitalise the caster when they strike a foe. It brings with it a dangerous, gnawing hunger to experience the pleasant taste of another's strength.  A cautionary tale suggests that the twisted, accursed leech-priests of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] were created using a variant of this ritual, or fell into the clutches of an eternal of Winter after their reliance on this magic became too pronounced.
This [[Enchantment|enchantment]] is sometimes coupled with the use of an [[Agramant's Bargain]] or a similarly enchanted implement. The magic also has an obvious synergy with the [[Splintering Gorget]] [[Weapons & Armour#Mage Armour|mage armour]].
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes leeches, bats and other creatures that feed on the blood of the living. They may shed blood into a goblet of sweet wine for the target to drink or offer gifts or tokens that represent the power to take strength from others. The runes [[Kyrop]] and [[Naeve]] are commonly evoked, and some magicians favour the name of [[Agramant]] or even [[Sorin]] (whose philosophy of growth through suffering seems a peripheral match for this ritual).
