## Description
This [[Enchantment]] is one of the best-known Summer [[Rituals|rituals]]. It is performed on warriors across the Empire, helping them to survive the rigours of war. While [[Splendid Panoply of Knighthood]] is more effective at enchanting a band of soldiers, it lacks the enduring power of  ''[[Strength of the Bull]]''; this is a common blessing from a skilled Summer magician on friends and allies who might face violence at any time.
It is commonly included as part of the preparations for war, or performed during a formal or informal gathering of warriors - given that it lasts for several months, it can be performed well in advance. While a band of [[Navarr]] may combine the ritual with formal war-painting, a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Groups#Covens|coven]] may perform the ritual around a fire the evening before battle to the accompaniment of stirring tales. A legion of [[Imperial Orcs]] may declare a promise of victory as their shaman move among them, and may celebrate the magic with a bout of fighting; a [[Dawn|Dawnish]] [[Earl]] is more likely to have the ritual performed by a close friend or lover, who [[Dawn Hearth Magic#Girding|girds]] her for battle and completes the ritual by bestowing a favour. A [[The Marches|Marcher]] band may gather barefoot on the morning of battle, while an [[Urizen]] coven might move serenely among a group of [[Sentinel|sentinels]] as they drill several days in advance of any expected hostilities. A [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] ritual is likely to involve everyone drumming and dancing in celebration of life, while a [[Highguard|Highborn]] ritual is more likely to involve a solemn recitation of the rolls of the dead, perhaps followed by a blessing from a priest.
## Common Elements
As with many [[Enchantment]] [[Rituals|rituals]], common elements include the consumption of wholesome food and drink (especially mead or beer) and the use of tokens and gifts such as [[Dawn Hearth Magic#Favours|favours]]. 
Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Summer runes]] might be evoked, depending entirely on the nature of the warriors and the ritualists. Runes are often painted onto the skin especially the face and arms. Navarr [[Navarr Magical Traditions#Vates|vates]] and [[Wintermark]] [[Wintermark Magical Traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]] alike will trace the scars, brands and tattoos of their targets as they perform the ritual, connecting the strength gained today with oaths or wounds from the past. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of horses, bulls, narwhal, [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]] and [[Legendary beasts#Dragons, Wyverns and Wyrms|dragons]].
The [[Captain's Mask]] is a [[:Category:Foci|ritual focus]] that helps empower the performance of this ritual.
