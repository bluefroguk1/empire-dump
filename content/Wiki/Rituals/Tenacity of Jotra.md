## Description
One of the simplest enchantments known, it is actually reasonably rare to find anyone who has mastered ''[[Tenacity of Jotra]]''; there are after all many more powerful enchantments available to the practitioners of Summer lore. The small amount of additional fortitude it grants is rarely considered to be [[Worth]] the expenditure of mana it requires.
Where the spell is sometimes valuable is in enhancing the constitution of an individual who is already quite tenacious, or as an adjunct to the use of an [[Abraxus Stone]].
## Common Elements
As with many Enchantment [[Rituals]], common elements include the consumption of wholesome food and drink (especially mead or beer) and the use of tokens and gifts such as favours. Unsurprisingly, the rune [[Jotra]] is often used, [[Painted]] onto the skin especially the skin of the chest or belly. Likewise an evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of Horses, boars, bears and other animals famed for their bodily fortitude.
