### Effects
This ritual enchants a [[Forest|forest]]. It requires a number rings of [[Ilium|ilium]] equal to the level the [[Forest|forest]] [[Will|will]] be upgraded to (one more than the current rank of the [[Forest|forest]]). When the ritual is complete the illium is consumed and over the next few weeks the power of the [[Forest|forest]] is increased - it is permanently upgraded one level. 
The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] does not prevent a character from upgrading their forest during [[Downtime|downtime]] using the normal rules.
The owner of the forest experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]] while their forest is [[Enchanted|enchanted]]:  you feel an urge to [[Challenge|challenge]] traditional understanding and hearsay, and to pick apart the "accepted truths" that people take for granted.
