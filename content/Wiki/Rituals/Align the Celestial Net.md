## Rules
Season|Night|30
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction
Regio| The ritual targets the [[Regio|regio]] in which it is performed. It cannot be performed by a [[Coven|coven]] who is drawing on the power of that [[Regio|regio]] to enhance their ritual.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual shifts the [[Realm]] quality of a Regio for purposes of the next ritual cast using that regio.
The regio can be shifted one step in either direction along a fixed progression.
[[Day]]  [[Winter]]  [[Spring]]  [[Night]]  [[Summer]]  [[Autumn]]  Day
The [[Enchantment]] lasts until a ritual is performed using that regio, or the next sunrise, whichever comes first.
### Additional Strength
The ritual can be used to shift a regio ''two'' steps along the progression in either direction by increasing its magnitude by 50.
## Description
As with [[The Eight-Spoked Wheel]], there is a great deal of mystery around how precisely this ritual does... what it does. ''[[Align the Celestial Net]]'' should in theory only transform a Night Regio, or only allow a regio to be aligned to Night. Instead it allows transformation around a 'wheel' and is equally effective at targeting regio aligned to other [[Realms|realms]], or aligning a regio into any [[Realm|realm]]. Despite its versatility, it is often easier to use this ritual to align a Night [[Aura|aura]] than any of the others - perhaps because Night auras are so imbued with the energies of transformation, more likely because a Night regio is likely to enhance [[Night Realm]] [[Magic|magic]] performed within it.
The [[Urizen]] claim that the ritual draws on the power of [[Astronomancy]], specifically on [[Constellations|constellations]] such as [[The Wanderer]] and [[The Door]]. The runesmiths of [[Wintermark]] claim it relies on the convergence of [[Wyr]] and [[Xun]]. The [[Highguard]] prefer to imagine that it is the result of human magical strength bending the power of the supernatural Realms to their [[Will|will]]. It may well be that none of them, or all of them, are right.
The ritual is at its most effective when used on a battlefield. With it, a regio attuned to Spring might be shifted to Winter to allow a powerful [[Curse|curse]] to be invoked, or a regio attuned to Autumn might be shifted to Summer to allow the creation of a vital Enchantment. Either way, mastery of the ritual is not common - its use is circumstantial - but when it is needed it dramatically increases [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] options of an Imperial strike force.
The ritual is believed to have minimal effect on the regio-[[Aura|aura]] at [[Anvil]]; that regio is already attuned to several realms. The [[Imperial Conclave]] has specifically interdicted the use of this ritual on the Imperial Regio at [[Anvil]], for fear that it may have unforeseen repercussions for the [[Sentinel Gate]], the [[Hall of Worlds]], or the settlement of Anvil.
## Common Elements
The performance of this ritual depends largely on the realms involved. To shift a ritual from Spring to Winter, symbols of entropy and declining energy might be used. To shift from Autumn to Day, images associated with building order and hierarchy through influence and rational thought might be more appropriate. The ritualists must be inside the regio, and often subject to any [[Roleplaying effects|roleplaying effects]].
As previously mentioned, this ritual often involves the [[Runes|runes]] [[Xun]] and [[Wyr]], the constellations of [[The Wanderer]] and [[The Door]], and the invocation of eternals of Night associated with mystery and transformation.
