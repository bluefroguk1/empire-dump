## Rules
Season|Day|8
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Area enchant
[[Enchantment]] This is also a location [[Aura]]. A target may only be under the effect of one Aura at a time.
### Effects
This ritual enchants an area with a potent aura. Anyone who enters the area becomes aWare of (and subject to) the aura, and experiences a powerful roleplaying effect: they feel calm, relaxed and focused; they find meditation and rational discussion preferable to physical action. All emotions and pressing concerns are muted; physical action and behaving in an impassioned way are both tiring. Violence requires a major effort of will.

## Description
This ritual creates an [[Enchanted]] aura that evokes feelings of calm focus and mental clarity, similar to those that surround some Eternals of the Day [[Realm]]. It is commonly used to prepare areas that enCourage relaxation and quiet discussion. Some [[Urizen]] spires have an area set aside specifically for the use of this ritual - and a rare few have expended the expensive resources needed to create a permanent Aura in a library or meditation chamber. Many [[Merrow]] find such enchanted areas especially appealing - not least because of their effectiveness at convincing more boisterous companions to settle down a little and become easier to deal with.
Such persistent enchantments are almost always performed inside a building rather than in a tent or other fragile structure - simply because it is too easy to cause the enchantment to collapse by shifting the boundaries of the Aura. Magicians theorize that an [[Ilium]]-infused enchantment such as this would be especially strong. They speculate that in addition to the usual resistance to replacing such an enchantment with an enchantment not also infused with ilium, removing or replacing the aura with the [[Consecration]] ceremony would only work if the priests involved used true [[Liao]]. The reticence of the Synod to "waste" True true liao on magical experimentation has meant that there is no definitive proof either way.
Some doctors and Healers find the ritual useful for treating patients who are in a great deal of pain or have terminal illnesses - the quiet and calm created in the aura can also be a boon to convalescence.
There have always been priests who are skeptical of this Enchantment, and those like it. They claim that it somehow invokes a false virtue, or even a malign spiritual presence. However such claims are often dismissed by scholars of [[Magic]]. Magicians of the [[Sevenfold Path]] have demonstrated more than once that while consecrations and enchantments such as these share some similarities, they are ''different'' on a profound level. In practice, most priests see ''The Solace of Chimes'' much as they would any other Enchantment - it is just something that influences the minds of mortals, through magic. It may be a useful tool, or a test for the faithful, but the context in which it is encountered is the most important thing. More than one priest on the path of [[Wisdom]] or even [[Vigilance]] has seen the value in such auras, and the clarity of thought they encourage.
The ritual is known and used by people across the world by many different names. Imperial magicians speculate that it should be possible to create similar enchantments in the Summer, Spring, and even Winter realms although no such [[Rituals]] are currently part of [[Imperial lore]].
## Common Elements
This ritual is designed to create feelings of calm and inspire meditation. It is often performed with soothing [[Music]], especially the sound of wind-chimes. Soothing incense is often burnt, and where possible the area is dressed in neutral colours and decorated with patterns designed to help focus the mind (mandalas, depictions of the [[Runes]] of Day and so on). Crystals, mirrors and other reflective surfaces are often scattered around the area.  Invocations are almost invariably performed in quiet voices, and may involve participants sitting and staying as still as possible.
The area is often dressed in ways that highlight and reinforce the culture of the nation to which the ritualist belongs. A [[Highguard]] [[Magister]] performing this ritual is likely to ensure that there is a suitable vessel for washing the hands and face. A [[Navarr]] vate is likely to decorate the area with complex, swirling designs that can be studied and followed during meditation.
The rune [[Cavul]] is almost always evoked with this ritual.
