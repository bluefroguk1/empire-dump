### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same [[Banner|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 6. Additional [[Characters|characters]] must be present throughout.
## Description
This [[Enchantment]] allows a target to pin an opponent in place for a short time, making them especially vulnerable to capture, or to defeat if they are wielding short weapons. It is sometimes called ''The [[Thief-taker]]'s Net'', and used to stop fleeing fugitives in their tracks. Unlike the ability granted by the [[Entangle]] spell, the power of the ''Constricting Scourge'' allows the target to restrain an opponent with a simple strike from a weapon or implement.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, a [[Coven|coven]] often invokes symbols of binding, stagnation and hesitation. Some magicians weave invocations of doubt and uncertainty, while others evoke forces of capture or [[Law|law]] enforcement. Skirling pipe-[[Music|music]] may often be involved, as might interweaving flutes. Sinuous dances are common, but so are things that bind - chains, threads, ropes, nets and even ribbons.
Other common elements in this ritual might include [[Runes|runes]], especially [[Hirmok]]. Beasts such as spiders and great serpents that crush their prey may be mentioned, and some [[Freeborn]] use images of octopi, squid or even kraken in their [[Magic|magic]]. The [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Chain]] is sometimes invoked, as are the names of the [[Autumn]] Eternals know as the [[Lictors]].
