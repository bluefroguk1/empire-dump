### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same banner. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 6. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
This Enchantment allows a target to pin an opponent in place for a short time, making them especially vulnerable to capture, or to defeat if they are wielding short weapons. It is sometimes called ''The [[Thief-taker]]'s Net'', and used to stop fleeing fugitives in their tracks. Unlike the ability granted by the Entangle spell, the power of the ''Constricting Scourge'' allows the target to restrain an opponent with a simple strike from a weapon or implement.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, a coven often invokes symbols of binding, stagnation and hesitation. Some Magicians weave invocations of doubt and uncertainty, while others evoke forces of capture or law enforcement. Skirling pipe-[[Music]] may often be involved, as might interweaving flutes. Sinuous dances are common, but so are things that bind - chains, threads, ropes, nets and even ribbons.
Other common elements in this ritual might include [[Runes]], especially [[Hirmok]]. Beasts such as spiders and great serpents that crush their prey may be mentioned, and some Freeborn use iMages of octopi, squid or even kraken in their [[Magic]]. The constellation of [[The Chain]] is sometimes invoked, as are the names of the Autumn Eternals know as the [[Lictors]].
