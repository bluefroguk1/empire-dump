## Rules
Season|Autumn|80
[[Urizen]] Lore
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction
regio|Autumn  This ritual targets an [[Imperial army]]. The [[General|general]] responsible for the army (or the [[Egregore|egregore]] if the [[General|general]] is not at [[Anvil]]) must be present throughout.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
Go to Ground
* Defending order.
* Your side must control a region with the  hills keyword.
* The ability of this army to defend [[Territory|territory]] is increased by a fifth.
* [[Casualties]] suffered by this army are decreased by a fifth.
* [[Casualties]] inflicted by this army are decreased by a fifth.
The army uses their supernatural understanding of broken territory to slow enemy advances. The unmatched ability of the soldiers to travel quickly via hidden paths, and to exploit the rugged terrain to hamper their attackers makes the army difficult to attack directly, and rarely presents the enemy with an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for a pitched battle.
### Effects
This ritual enchants a campaign army, granting the soldiers a supernatural understanding of and ability to move through hills and similar rugged terrain. The army loses any existing quality and gains the ''Hillwise'' quality for the duration. For the duration the [[General|general]] can issue the order ''Go to Ground'' when defending, but only while fighting in a Territory where their side controls a region with the ''hills'' quality.
While the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] persists, the [[General|general]] responsible for the army experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: '' you become suspicious of anyone moving in your peripheral vision, and feel an urge to ensure you always have a clear view of the exits from your location.''

## Description
This ritual was one of the very first to become part of [[Urizen lore]], following the [[Autumn]] Equinox 383YE. Contributed by Mord Thorntarry of the [[Spire]] of Auric Horizon, the ritual was one of those contained in the book ''Meditations''. Written by Callus Strategos, [[Dean of the Lyceum]] during the reign of [[Empress Britta]], the book also contained [[Swords in the Noonday Sun]], [[Good Green Oak]], [[Hook of the Hoarfrost Guardian]], and two [[Rituals|rituals]] that had already become part of [[Imperial lore]] - [[Find the Best Path]] and [[Hammers of the Brilliant Shore]].
There are few things more disheartening than facing an enemy army that has superior command of the terrain over which the campaign is fought. The [[Thule]] were like ghosts – they would vanish in one area and appear in another hours later. They fired arrows at us across impassable chasms; they confounded our catapults with the spurs of the mountains; they sabotaged and hid the passes. We spilled so much blood trying to push northwards it stained the rivers red.
All that changed when the Varushkans appeared. The [[Northern Eagle]] [[Banner|banner]] came up with the sun, and they fell on the [[Thule]] like the [[Judgement|judgement]] of the heavens. They had a counter to every tactic and perhaps most importantly they had heavy woolen blankets. To this [[Day|day]], I have never forgotten the first [[Night|night]] I spent in the warm embrace of a … but I digress. They were prepared, is what I am trying to say, and their preparations and training and simple awareness of the hills and the slopes of the mountains saved lives. [[Mine]] included.
When I became Dean, I remembered my experiences fighting the [[Thule]] and decided to find a way to impart understanding of the terrain to the armies of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
A powerful [[Enchantment]] of the Autumn [[Realm|realm]], the [[Eyes of the Hills]] infuses soldiers with a supernatural awareness that allows them to quickly navigate rugged terrain. It also makes them preternaturally aware of living creatures, giving them unmatched ability to prepare ambushes and outmaneuver enemies relying on mundane senses. The army becomes adept at avoiding open battle, striking at their enemies and retreating, and making excellent use of the [[Opportunities|opportunities]] presented by broken ground, steep hillsides, cliffs, wild water, and even naturally occurring caves and tunnels.
The [[Magic|magic]] has a lingering effect on the [[General]] of the army however; their sensitivity to threats and awareness of their environment is heightened to potentially inconvenient levels. A nervous general, or one who is concerned about treachery, or who is already alert to the possibility of hidden danger - especially someone of the naturally alert for danger [[Draughir]] [[Lineage|lineage]] - might lash out at a perceived threat. Anyone moving around the general of an army [[Enchanted|enchanted]] with this potent defensive [[Magic|magic]] would do well to move slowly and obviously to avoid potential tragedy.
## Common Elements
As an [[Enchantment|enchantment]] that enhances a campaign army, the general of the target army serves as a vital focus for delivering the [[Magic|magic]]. a banner or standard that [[Will|will]] be used by the target force as a focus for the ritual is an obvious component, as is the presence of soldiers who have fought beneath that banner in the recent past. Other elements include girding or crowning [[The Military|the military]] leader, the slow and steady beat of drums, and the use of earth or stone from battlefields in suitably hilly environments.
[[The Mountain]] has a strong resonance for this [[Enchantment|enchantment]] - both as a literal representation of the [[Magic|magic]] and as symbol of [[The Law|the law]] ''Things are not easy''." [[The Spider]] also works well with this ritual - the [[Magic|magic]] after all imparts potency to scouts,  observers,  and pathfinders moving stealthily to observe enemy positions.
