## Rules
Season|Winter|14
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2  The area to be [[Enchanted|enchanted]] with this ward must be clearly apparent to those within, and without, its bounds.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
This ritual targets a building or well defined, walled area. It must be performed inside that location.
At the completion, the area is warded against the Heralds of the eternals. Such a creature approaching the boundary is always aware that the area is warded; if it enters it is immediately weakened for as long as they remain in the area. Even creatures that are larger-than-human-sized [[Will|will]] be weakened by the power of the ward if they enter it.
When used inside a building, the ward protects the entire structure. Any openings in the structure - doors and windows especially - must be clearly marked with [[Runes|runes]] or symbols of warding. The building must be a reasonably permanent structure, preferably of wood or stone; the ritual [[Will|will]] not work on a tent or other entirely similar structure.

If undisturbed, the ward remains until the next sunrise.
## Description
This is a powerful ritual that keeps Heralds at bay. Weak Heralds [[Will|will]] usually hesitate before entering the area; the more powerful the creature is, the more it has to lose and the less likely it is to enter the ward if it has any choice. Magical scholars see no reason that the ward would not be equally useful against eternals themselves, but few people have ever been in a position to test this theory.
The wards are effective against Heralds who serve as diplomats, but also on more martial Heralds such as the troops conjured by [[Rituals|rituals]] like [[Knights of Glory]]. Some lineaged individuals with very strong [[Lineage|lineage]] are known to be uncomfortable if they spend large amounts of time in a warded area - often lethargic and short tempered. It is not clear if this is a real magical effect, or a psychological repercussion of knowing the ward was in place.
## Common Elements
The most common [[Runes|runes]] to use with this ritual are the [[Wintermark]] [[Runes|runes]] [[Yoorn]] and [[Kyrop]] and the common tower symbol associated with [[Vigilance]]. In [[Varushka]] these wards are often supplemented with staring humanoid faces or the heads of geese, while in [[Wintermark]] bird-heads are common on the top of any warding poles. In [[The Marches]] the warding symbols often include stylised figures of guardians, or straw poppets- sometimes with small daggers, needles or shields bound to their limbs.
When performing the ritual, the ritualists often walk the boundaries of the waded area, invoking protection. They often burn incense, or scatter ashes, and check that all the warding symbols are intact. Some ritualists place bowls of milk or honey at each entry point. Fire is often used as well, especially when the ritual is performed at [[Night|night]].
