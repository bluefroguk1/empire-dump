## Rules
Season|Spring|22
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains the ability to call [[Shatter|shatter]] twice each [[Day|day]] with a great weapon. 
The target also experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: you want to deal with problems and obstacles in the simplest and most direct way; to act ''now'' rather than worry about complicated plans. When confronted by a complex situation, the urge is always to solve it in a direct physical way (rather than find another way through a a locked door, smash [[The Door|the door]] in, for example).

## Description
In the [[Spring]] [[Realm|realm]], the works of mortal artifice, crafting or building are quickly undone. Stories suggest that not only do bodies rot away within minutes, but that a book, sword, suit of armour or even a castle would be quickly undone by the relentless assault of trees, wind and rain. This ritual harnesses some of that power and turns it against the enemies of the [[Coven|coven]].
This ritual is commonly attributed to the [[Landskeeper]] Moira of Old Pig, who named it after the opening lines of a short poem about [[Glory]] attributed to the early Marcher poet Od the Blithe. ''The castle has [[Gone|gone]],'' it begins, ''but [[The Mountain|the mountain]] and [[The Forest Remains|the forest remains]].'' It is also known as ''The Viridian Hammer'' (referencing [[The Way|the way]] that new shoots can force their way between and ultimately crack flagstones and cobblestones), ''Splintering Woodsman's Axe''  and ''The Devouring Storm'' (often with reference to the various insects and bugs that destroy wood and cloth).
The [[Enchantment]] does not provide any additional ability to wield a two-handed weapon. As a consequence the ritual is best performed on someone who already knows how to use a maul, greataxe or similar two-handed weapon.
With the additional power provided by this ritual, the target can smash their way through a shield, or quickly disarm a number of opponents armed with pole-arms or pikes. While it grants an obvious advantage to someone already able to break such things, it can also be just the tool needed to get past an obstacle in the absence of such heroic individuals.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes the relentless powers of natural destruction and erosion. These forces may take the form of wind and rain, the irresistible strength of vines and roots that tear down walls, or the slow rot that consumes wood and leather.  
The ritual often involves [[Music|music]], chanting or dancing with a slow increase in tempo until the performance reaches a violent crescendo. This slow building of power to a destructive climax mirrors [[The Way|the way]] that natural forces tear at the fruits of civilisation. The ritual may also involve destroying fragile items, working to create a sympathetic relationship between that destruction and the destruction the ritualists hope to visit on their enemies.
Some ritualists invoke the name of the [[Eternal]] [[Llofir]], the fungal lord of rot and  decay who represents the slow triumph of natural forces over craftsmanship.
The [[Rune|rune]] [[Mawrig]] is a common element of this ritual, as is the evocation of [[The Claw]] or even [[The Oak]].
