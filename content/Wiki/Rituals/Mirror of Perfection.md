### Effects
This ritual [[Enchantment|enchants]] a mana site. It requires a number rings of [[Ilium|ilium]] equal to the level the mana site will be upgraded to (one more than the current rank of the mana site). When the ritual is complete the illium is consumed and over the next few weeks the power of the mana site is increased - it is permanently [[Mana site#upgrades|upgraded]] one level. 
The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] does not prevent a character from upgrading their mana site during downtime using the normal rules.
The owner of the mana site experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]] while their mana site is enchanted: you feel an urge to question established wisdom especially about magical matters and are fascinated by different ways of doing things.
