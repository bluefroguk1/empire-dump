### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Mana site]] 
Performing this ritual requires a number of rings of [[Ilium]] equal to the level the mana site will be upgraded to.
[[Enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual enchants a mana site. It requires a number rings of ilium equal to the level the mana site will be upgraded to (one more than the current rank of the mana site). When the ritual is complete the illium is consumed and over the next few weeks the power of the mana site is increased - it is permanently upgraded one level. 
The enchantment does not prevent a character from upgrading their Mana site during downtime using the normal rules.
The owner of the Mana site experiences a Roleplaying effect while their Mana site is [[Enchanted]]: you feel an urge to question established [[Wisdom]] especially about Magical matters and are fascinated by different ways of doing things.
