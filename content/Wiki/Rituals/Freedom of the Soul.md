## Rules
Season|Night|2
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] This is also a [[Aura#Personal Auras|personal aura]]. A target may only be under the effect of one [[Aura]] at a time.
### Effects
At the conclusion of the ritual, the target is [[Enchantment|enchanted]] with an aura of passionate energy. The target experiences a powerful [[Roleplaying effect]]; whenever they experience an emotion, they experience it far more strongly than normal. They switch between one powerful emotion and another freely and without restraint. They feel an urge to question and disregard anything that restrains their behaviour, whether it is a law, an expectation of society, or a sign that says 'no entry' on it.
The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] also provides a source of [[Roleplaying effects#spiritual strength|spiritual strength]] for purposes of overcoming any roleplaying effect that would dampen the expression of emotions, or create feelings of calm, clarity or tranquillity.
This [[Enchantment|enchantment]] is a personal aura, similar to that created using the [[Anointing]] ceremony. An individual can only be under the effect of one personal aura at a time. This ritual will replace any standard personal aura (including those created by similar [[Rituals|rituals]]), but is not powerful enough to remove a personal aura with a [[Aura#Strong Auras|strength]] higher than one. Likewise, any anointing can replace (or remove) this enchantment. A [[Detect Magic]] spell determines the realm and magnitude of the effect. The insight skill does not detect any spiritual element to the enchantment.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Band|band]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 1. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
This ritual creates a powerful [[Enchantment|enchanted]] aura on the target. Those who have experienced the enchantment often describe it as similar to being under the influence of certain powerful narcotics (or how they imagine such experiences might be). For the most part, the aura encourages joyful, positive behaviour - but it is just as likely to send an incautious person into a spiral of sadness and despair, or drive someone with repressed anger into a violent outburst. 
Some individuals particularly relish the way the enchantment encourages them to question convention, or encourage them to indulge in their pleasures without worrying about the consequences until the next day. Ironically, it is this very element that makes the ritual contentious. Some priests of the Way, for example, consider this enchantment little more than an attempt to channel the dangerous spiritual force of [[Malign spiritual presences#Anarchy|Anarchy]]. Less devout individuals, especially magistrates and militia, may treat people experiencing the aura as if they are extremely drunk, or heavily drugged.
Indeed, some students of Night magic view this ritual as an expensive narcotic to offer to the jaded and the bored, or to "''help a party go with a bang''". Others of a more mystical bent consider this enchantment to be a spiritual experience designed to free the mind from imposed restraints (which worries the priests even more, of course), or to achieve a cathartic release of pent-up frustrations. They view using this ritual 'for fun' as being an abuse of something much better suited to helping people explore philosophical truths about freedom and responsibility.  
The enchantment can be emotionally and physically exhausting. Regardless of whether it is being used to explore philosophical concepts or simply for fun, it is usually cast at night to restrict the potential duration. On a few are occasions, subjects have made themselves very ill indeed by forgetting to eat or drink while filled with enthusiasm and in the grip of powerful emotions - or engaged in rash and foolish actions that have consequences that persist long after the enchantment itself has faded away. This has led to some discussion about whether the ritual out to be [[Interdiction|interdicted]] - most recently in [[385YE Spring Equinox Conclave sessions#Interdiction: Freedom of the Soul|Spring 385YE]].
The eternal [[Janon]] is known to favour this enchantment, approving of the way it inspires people to embrace their passions.
## Common Elements
This ritual often involves a symbolic 'freeing' of the target from chains or bonds. Narcotics are a common element, as is the consumption of strong drink or herbal preparations. Fires that are stoked and made brighter, or music and dance that begins quietly and becomes faster and more exuberant, are also regular components of this ritual., 
The rune [[Zorech]] is unsurprisingly a common element, and the eternal [[Janon]] is often evoked during performances of the ritual.
