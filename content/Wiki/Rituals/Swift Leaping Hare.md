## Description
Also known as ''Cunning Puissance of the Leaping Hare'' in some circles, this Enchantment is among one of the best-known [[Summer rituals]]. Along with Swan's Cruel Wing, [[Hammer of Thunder]] and [[Strength of the Bull]] it provides a coven with the ability to select the right enchantment to enhance any band of Warriors.
The ritual is usually referred to by its popular Marcher name. The swift movement of the hare and [[The Way]] it weaves back and forth underfoot are an iMage associated with the quick and deft use of a bill to hook a target's legs out from under her. Some Magicians use the name of their own favoured totem animal in the ritual - for example it is called ''The Dancing Fox'' by some [[Navarr]], while several cabals of Dawnish [[War]]-witches call it ''Glittering Salmon Leap'', and a few [[Urizen]] refer to it as the ''Charge of [[The Mountain]] Goat''.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their polearm. A ritualist might trace matching [[Runes]] on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. The target is often persuaded to perform a series of quick, deft manoeuvres; sweeping, jabbing and hooking as the ritualist weaves [[Magic]] over the warrior and the polearm. Legendary warriors, especially those who displayed cleverness or guile, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 
Any of the Summer runes might be evoked, but [[Jotra]], the Rune of Battle, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of Horses and unicorns.
