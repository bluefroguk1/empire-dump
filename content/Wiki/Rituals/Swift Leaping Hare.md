## Description
Also known as ''Cunning Puissance of the Leaping Hare'' in some circles, this [[Enchantment]] is among one of the best-known Summer [[Rituals|rituals]]. Along with [[Swan's Cruel Wing]], [[Hammer of Thunder]] and [[Strength of the Bull]] it provides a [[Groups#Covens|coven]] with the ability to select the right [[Enchantment|enchantment]] to enhance any band of warriors.
The ritual is usually referred to by its popular [[The Marches|Marcher]] name. The swift movement of the hare and the way it weaves back and forth underfoot are an image associated with the quick and deft use of a bill to hook a target's legs out from under her. Some magicians use the name of their own favoured totem animal in the ritual - for example it is called ''The Dancing Fox'' by some [[Navarr]], while several cabals of [[Dawn|Dawnish]] war-witches call it ''Glittering Salmon Leap'', and a few [[Urizen]] refer to it as the ''Charge of the Mountain Goat''.
## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their polearm. A ritualist might trace matching runes on weapons and warrior, or might anoint them with a mixture of blood and oil. The target is often persuaded to perform a series of quick, deft manoeuvres; sweeping, jabbing and hooking as the ritualist weaves magic over the warrior and the polearm. Legendary warriors, especially those who displayed cleverness or guile, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of warlike mien. 
Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Summer runes]] might be evoked, but [[Jotra]], the Rune of Battle, is the most common. An evocation of [[The Stallion]] or [[The Oak]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as are evocations of horses and [[Legendary beasts#Unicorns|unicorns]].
