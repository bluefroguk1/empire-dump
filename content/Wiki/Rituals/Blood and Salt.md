## Rules
Season|Spring|12
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Resource|Fleet
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
The target [[Fleet|fleet]] earns additional profit during the next season, but only if it engages in privateering. The effect of the ritual increases the level of the target [[Fleet|fleet]] by 5 ranks, which is sufficient to effectively double the production of a starting [[Fleet|fleet]]. 
The character who controls the target [[Resource|resource]] is under a [[Roleplaying effect]] for at least ten minutes after the ritual is performed: they feel  unrestrained and unconcerned about the consequences of their actions, with an urge to take what they want; they feel uninhibited about using violence against anyone who gets in their way. 
Season Duration [[Downtime]] buff If the [[Fleet|fleet]] does not engage in privateering during the next [[Downtime|downtime]], the ritual has no effect.
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional fleets belonging to [[Characters|characters]] in the same [[Banner|banner]]. Each additional [[Fleet|fleet]] increases the magnitude by 8. The character who controls each fleet must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This ritual is sometimes called ''Blood in the Water'', ''The Shark Amidst the Nets'', ''The [[Corsair]]'s Cruel Smile'' and other equally poetic names. It helps to ensure that a Fleet [[Will|will]] get good weather and excellent tides, and fires the crew up with vigour and primitive strength. The more aggressive the crew is, the more the [[Magic|magic]] of [[Spring]] encourages them and strengthens them; if they engage in the relatively bloodless pursuit of trade, the [[Enchantment]] [[Will|will]] quickly fade.
A crew [[Enchanted|enchanted]] by this ritual does not turn on itself (although there are stories of crews who were already mutinous who tore each other apart once the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] began to erode their inhibitions and restraints); nor do they become monstrous (although there are also stories of cruel, merciless folk who lost the last vestiges of humanity under the influence of this [[Enchantment|enchantment]]); they are, after all, possessed of free [[Will|will]]. If a [[Fight|fight]] does break out they are less likely to offer or accept quarter or mercy, and likely to [[Fight|fight]] with wild, terrifying abandon. In many cases, the sheer ferocity of the sailors in the [[Enchanted|enchanted]] fleet is enough to convince the prey to give up without a [[Fight|fight]].
The ritual is obviously most common among the [[Freeborn]] corsairs and adventurous [[League]] privateers; there are also plenty of reports of the [[Grendel]] using similar enchantments. It is common for those who receive the benefit of the spell to offer a portion of any plunder they gain in the coming season to the ritualists, although this is by no means mandatory - not least because some ritualists prefer to be paid in advance rather than trust to the short memories of corsairs and privateers.
## Common Elements
The ritual both influences the weather and fills a crew with both vigour and bloodlust. Ritual performances often include the evocation of the [[Rune|rune]] of storms or the [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Claw]]. Blood is often shed during this ritual, often mixed with a cup or bowl of water or spirits and shared by the targets. Sometimes the ritual involves the targets cutting themselves with a blade and swearing oaths to be merciless in pursuit of their prey. There are often invocations of sharks or kraken during the performance of ''[[Blood and Salt]]''. 
The [[Magic|magic]] item known as the [[Corsair]]'s Bloody Mask can be used to make this ritual easier to perform.
