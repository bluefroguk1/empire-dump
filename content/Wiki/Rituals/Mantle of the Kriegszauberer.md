## Description
This ritual formed part of a gift given to the [[Imperial Conclave]] by the ''zauberer'' - magicians - of the [[Commonwealth]] in [[Recognition|recognition]] of the decision to share [[Imperial lore]] with that nation. Four scrolls were provided to different Grandmasters chosen by [[The Conclave|the Conclave]] and delivered at the [[Spring]] Equinox 384YE. The scroll containing [[Mantle of the Kriegszauberer]] was provided to the [[Grandmaster]] of the [[Rod and Shield]], Sakari Nightscale, who almost immediately arranged to have it added to [[Imperial lore]].
The ritual scroll itself was created at Volkavaar University, specifically for "''the Order of the rod and the shield, who wisely encourage magicians to use their powers in defence of [[The Empire|the Empire]], even if they are not a warrior by calling''." According to the scroll, the [[Magic|magic]] of the ''kriegszauberer'' is "''a powerful and versatile weapon, one that can help determine the outcome of a clash of arms if it is employed cleverly and as part of a wider strategy. Some kriegszauberer are adept healers, restoring their injured comrades so they can continue fighting. Others are warriors themselves, able to [[Shatter|shatter]] the weapons and shields of their enemies, or send weak soldiers flying to disrupt the enemy formation. Unfortunately, the fact that the kriegszauberer cannot employ their [[Skills|skills]] while wearing real armour limits their ability to operate on the front lines of an engagement. This ritual [[Enchantment|enchantment]] does its best to improve both their ability to resist the blows of their enemies, and their ability to use their magic in a decisive manner before they are ultimately overrun.''"
The ritual builds on the less powerful [[Crimson Ward of Summer Stars]], providing significantly more protection and also infusing the [[Magician|magician]] with a reservoir of power that [[Will|will]] let them perform several more incantations - power that can be replenished by the usual means. It ''can'' lead to a little overconfidence, but also encourages the magician to rely on their comrades as well as themselves.
## Common Elements
Imperial magicians are still experimenting with the resonances of this [[Summer ritual]]. Given it innately involves a battle-magician and their [[Mage|mage]] amour, that connection is often the focus of the ritual performance. The mage armour may be ceremonially donned as part of the performance, each piece accompanied by an invocation or marked with a [[Rune|rune]] or symbol. Dawnish warwitches have been quick to point out the value of girding when creating this enchantment. Key points on the body that correspond roughly to the locations where mage armour is worn (the brow, the shoulders, the forearms, the shins, the belly, the chest and the neck) might also take place. A practitioner of [[Blood magic]] might prick the skin at each of these locations, spilling a few drops of blood, before donning the corresponding piece of mage armour.
The rune [[Feresh]] seems to resonate well with this ritual, along with evocations of [[The Stallion]], of horses or bears, and especially of unicorns and gryphons. A dramaturge may find that [[The Captain]] has strong associations with this ritual, but a scene involving [[The Witch]], who provides a gift of a ring, also serves to strengthen the ritual, especially if the scene takes place in [[The Counting House]].
