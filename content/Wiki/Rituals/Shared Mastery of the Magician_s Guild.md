### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same coven. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 3. Additional characters must have the magician skill and be present throughout; each target receives the ability to cast the same spell.
## Description
This ritual allows a magician to share their spell casting knowledge with other members of their coven. It differs from [[Day]] [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Illuminate the Higher Mind]] because it builds on the bonds between members of a coven to share [[Skills|skills]] and knowledge, rather than allowing that knowledge to be accessed by any targets.
While it is less versatile than [[Illuminate]] the Higher Mind, it is still useful for allowing a coven to expand their versatility; a common use is to allow members to cast spells such as [[Mend]] or [[Repel]] that might be useful in a coming battle. While it is often used by a coven, it is a simple enough ritual that a single scholar of [[Autumn magic]] might perform it; even though it draws on the bonds between coven-mates, it does not automatically require the use of the coven bond.
## Common Elements
The ritual usually involves a symbolic transfer of knowledge between the character who knows the chosen spell, and the recipients. This often mimics the master/apprentice or student/teacher relationship, but it may just as often build on the idea of 'sharing [[Guild|guild]] secrets' or using 'understudies'. Tokens marked with the [[Runes|runes]] [[Queros]] or [[Lann]] may change hands. [[Navarr]] and Winterfolk ritualists often enact a merging or exchange of blood when they use this ritual, cutting the palm and then clasping hands as the ritual is performed.
A repetition of the coven oath is sometimes used with this ritual, especially in the Varushkan cabals and between Imperial orc oathwrights.
