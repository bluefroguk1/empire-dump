## Rules
Season|Winter|12
[[Urizen]] Lore
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2  Target Character The character must possess the [[Dedication]] skill.
[[Enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains the ability to use [[Liao]] to remove an [[Aura]] on a person, location, or item exactly as if they were using the [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], or Hallowing skill. The character can cooperate with other characters using the appropriate skill or the benefits of this enchantment to help destroy a more powerful aura following all the normal rules.  
When removing a durable aura, the enchantment allows the character to spend up to two additional doses of Liao to increase the strength of the ceremony by the same amount.
The ritual paradoxically creates it's own Roleplaying effect; ''you become keenly aWare of the importance of exercising free will without external influence.''
Season Duration
