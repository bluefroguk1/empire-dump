## Rules
Season|Night|8
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|10 Imperial Reduction
Regio|Night Target [[Territory]]
This ritual is a shroud.
### Effects
The ritual targets a single territory. At the completion of the ritual the target territory is sheltered by a shadowy penumbra that dissipates and blinds attempts to scry the territory or divine information about it with [[Magic|magic]]. Unless the divination or scrying ritual is performed with a magnitude at least equal to the magnitude of the veil, the only information it can gain is the presence of a [[Night]] [[Enchantment|enchantment]] and the magnitude of the effect.
Any scrying or divination ritual that attempts to penetrate the veil, or any ritual that attempts to actually remove it, must have a magnitude at least equal to the of the veil
Anyone traveling to the territory [[Will|will]] find that the night sky appears strange and unfamiliar - the stars are not where they are expected to be, and the moon often seems closer, or further away. The more mana has been spent to create the veil, the more unfamiliar the night sky becomes. This may cause some consternation among the folk living in that territory.

## Description
This ritual is a two-edged sword. It makes it very hard for enemy magicians to scry on [[Events|events]] in the target territory, but it also attracts attention. What could the magicians be doing in that territory that is so important? The [[Freeborn]] [[Magician|magician]] Alcin i [[Guerra]] used to claim that he spent much of his spare time at [[Anvil]] weaving this ritual around random territories in [[The Empire|the Empire]] to confuse and unsettle [[Barbarian|barbarian]] [[Shamans|shamans]]. He made such extensive use of the ritual that it is still called ''Alcin's Celestial [[Confusion]]'' in some parts.
## Common Elements
A common focus for this ritual is a map depicting the target territory. It is sometimes obscured during the casting, or even burnt at the completion. Sometimes the map is created from sand or painstakingly drawn with salt or coloured powders, so it can be obscured with a gesture by the ritualists. Another common element involves the use of shuttered or dark lanterns, or flickering candles, or dim lightstones which provide limited illumination and are passed from ritualist to ritualist around the central map focus, symbolizing the shifting of the stars that accompanies the ritual veil.
The [[Rune|rune]] [[Wyr]] is commonly used during this ritual, and the [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Wanderer]] is often invoked.
