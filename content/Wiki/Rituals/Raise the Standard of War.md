### Effects
The [[Military unit|military unit]] gains a significant bonus to its effectiveness when it is assigned to support a campaign army. [[Military unit|Military Unit]] Strength|100|5
The character who controls [[The Military|the military]] unit experiences a short-lived [[Roleplaying effect]]: they are immediately reminded of any military threats, unresolved grudges or slights against themselves or the things they hold dear, and feel an urge to immediately set about dealing with those threats, grudges or slights. The effect persists for at least ten minutes after the ritual is complete.
Season Duration

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional military units controlled by members of the same [[Banner|banner]]. Each additional military unit increases the magnitude by 15. The character who controls each unit must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This ritual empowers and enhances a military unit, granting them strength of [[Will|will]] and fighting spirit for the coming season. The soldiers in that unit [[Will|will]] find it easier to [[Fight|fight]] against difficult odds, and feel a rush of confidence in their abilities. The ritual can have the occasional downside - highly regimented or ordered troops may experience a little decline in discipline as the soldiers feel a strong urge to take charge of situations and deal with things themselves rather than use [[The Chain|the chain]] of command - but this negative effect is generally transitory. As a counterpoint, affected warriors also tend to feel a swell of [[Pride|pride]] in themselves and their comrades, which can help reinforce their ability to rely on each other in the fray. Unfortunately it also makes brawls between military units more common, especially if there are several units all under the effect of ''[[Raise the Standard of War]].''
On [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], warriors under this [[Enchantment]] [[Fight|fight]] ferociously, giving little quarter and revelling in the challenges of [[War|war]]. They gain additional constitution, meaning that while they are in greater danger they are also better prepared to deal with that danger.
This ritual is also sometimes called ''The Field of [[Glory]]'', a reference to the [[Summer]] [[Eternal]] [[Eleonaris]] who is [[The Sovereign|the sovereign]] of a region of the [[Realm]] by that name. Her association with banners, flags, standards, heraldry and livery means that these are often used as elements when performing the ritual.
## Common Elements
This ritual enhances a small military force, using a connection to its leader to spread [[Magic|magic]] through the entire unit. It is exceptionally common to include a banner or standard that will be used by the target force as a focus for the ritual. Other common elements include the invocation of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Pride]] and [[Courage]], as well as calling on the name of Summer eternals such as [[Eleonaris]], the ''Sovereign in Scarlet and Gold'', or [[Hayaak]], the ''Brother of Lions'' (the latter is especially appropriate when the military force will be engaging hated foes, or foes that deserve retribution). Other elements include girding the military leader, the sound of martial horns or drums, and the presence of warriors from the same nation as the target as witnesses.
The [[Rune]] of Victory, [[Tykonus]], is favoured for this ritual not only for its magical meaning but also because of its common associations with banners and flags.
