### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional congregations provided the congregations are all controlled by [[Characters|characters]] from the same [[Sect|sect]]. Each additional [[Congregation|congregation]] increases the magnitude by 5. The character who controls each [[Congregation|congregation]] must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This ritual targets a [[Congregation]] and the community that surrounds it. Although the people influenced by this [[Enchantment]] are likely unaware, it works through [[The Web|the web]] of friendship, [[Family|family]] and acquaintance among the people near the [[Congregation|congregation]], gently encouraging them to attend that  
As with [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Rivers of Gold]], this ritual is very subtle. The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] is very difficult to spot without magical means, unless one knows it has been cast. Regardless of the influence, the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] does not make the targets embrace the words of their spiritual leader without question; it helps the priests involved with the congregation to understand the people who come to them for advice, or to hear them speak about their faith, but it does not make people more credulous. 
The ritual swells a congregation both by attracting the faithful and by influencing the choices of those who are perhaps less devout, gently nudging them towards seeking spiritual support. People in the area who would have sought a place of worship or prayer [[Will|will]] tend to choose the [[Enchanted|enchanted]] congregation to join. The effects are reasonably temporary; a few of those influenced might continue to attend their new congregation, but the ritual is no substitute for the hard work required to permanently increase the size of a congregation.
Some priests in the [[Imperial Synod]] are sharply divided over this ritual. Some view it as a sinister plot to undermine [[The Way|the Way]], others as simply a way to encourage the faithful to attend one congregation or another - generally a prosperous or ambitious congregation. The civil service do not make a distinction between a congregation that has temporarily increased in size through the influence of this ritual and one that has been increased by other means - the faithful are still worshipping and receiving spiritual advice, and the rules are quite clear that this means the congregation in question gains additional allocation of [[Liao]] and votes. 
## Common Elements
This ritual deals with the Imperial faith, and as such it is usually performed to the accompaniment of a sermon, and with symbols of the Imperial Virtues. The target priests usually make a special effort to attend the ritual in their full finery, and often bring along any members of their congregation or sect who are present. 
The invocation is likely to focus on the connections between the priest and their congregation, or the role that a church, temple, shrine or cathedral plays in the lives of the faithful. The [[Constellations|constellations]] of The Web and [[The Chain]] may be evoked, especially in [[Urizen]] and the [[Runes|runes]] [[Queros]], [[Feresh]] and [[Irremais]] may be evoked (especially in [[Wintermark]]).
