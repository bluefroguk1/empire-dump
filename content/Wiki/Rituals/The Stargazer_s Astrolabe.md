### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character When this ritual is performed by a coven, the target must be contributing to the ritual.
[[Enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains the ability to cast the [[Detect Magic]] spell four times each day as if they know it without spending any mana.
They also experience a Roleplaying effect: you find [[Magic]] fascinating; it's enjoyable to talk about it and even more enjoyable to observe it being cast or experience it first hand. You also may experience odd sensory effects; any spell that you hear being cast causes you to perceive dramatic displays of colourful light that can be quite distracting. When you are in a location with a magical [[Aura]] such as a [[Chamber of Delights]] or a [[Regio]] you will experience peculiar Visions of colours and shapes, as well as peculiar snatches of sound. Coming into contact with a magic item can likewise cause you to experience mild visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations.
If the target regains all spent personal mana by resting in a magical aura such as that provided by [[The Chamber]] of Delights, or drinks an Elixir of Empyrean Art, they ''also'' regain all spent uses of this ability at the same time. Other methods of restoring personal mana do not restore uses of Detect Magic.
