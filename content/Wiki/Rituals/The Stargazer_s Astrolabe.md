### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character When this ritual is performed by a [[Coven|coven]], the target must be contributing to the ritual.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
The target gains the ability to cast the [[Detect Magic]] spell four times each [[Day|day]] as if they know it without spending any mana.
They also experience a [[Roleplaying effect]]: you find [[Magic|magic]] fascinating; it's enjoyable to talk about it and even more enjoyable to observe it being cast or experience it first hand. You also may experience odd sensory effects; any spell that you hear being cast causes you to perceive dramatic displays of colourful light that can be quite distracting. When you are in a location with a magical [[Aura|aura]] such as a [[Chamber of Delights]] or a [[Regio]] you [[Will|will]] experience peculiar visions of colours and shapes, as well as peculiar snatches of sound. Coming into contact with a [[Magic|magic]] item can likewise cause you to experience mild visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations.
If the target regains all spent personal mana by resting in a magical [[Aura|aura]] such as that provided by [[The Chamber]] of Delights, or drinks an Elixir of Empyrean Art, they ''also'' regain all spent uses of this ability at the same time. Other methods of restoring personal mana do not restore uses of [[Detect Magic]].
