## Rules
Season|Night|10
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Fleet]]
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
The [[Fleet]] gains a significant bonus to its effectiveness when it is [[Fleet#Downtime Options|assigned]] to support a fleet-specific [[Spy network]]. This temporary bonus increases the effective fighting force of the unit by 100, the equivalent of 5 normal upgrades.
While the fleet is enchanted, the character who owns it experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: ''you find it difficult to be concerned about the legal implications of your actions. In particular, you find the idea of laws about who can own or use items or substances to be of minor consideration.''
Season Duration
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[Fleet|fleets]] as long as they are controlled by characters in the same [[Territory]]. Each additional fleet increases the magnitude by 8. The character who controls each fleet must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This [[Enchantment|enchantment]] of the [[Night magic|lore of Night]] was codified at the ''College of Silent Voices'' in the [[Sarcophan Delves]]. The ritual was given to the [[Imperial Conclave]] by the ''Haaienvermijders'', a Sarcophan magical cabal whose named apparently translates literally as "Shark Dodgers". The ritual was intended to help with the 384YE [[Struggle with the sea#Evacuating Feroz|evacuation of Feroz]], where it was apparently used to great effect. It was secured as [[Struggle with the sea#Sarcophan Magic|part of a deal]] brokered by the [[Eternal]] [[Sadogua]], and in exchange the Haaienvermijders received a copy of "Andreas i Sol-Devorador i Erigo's [[Golden Voyage]]" from the Conclave.
The [[Enchantment|enchantment]] it provides combines the [[Night magic#Resonance|resonance]] of [[Night magic#Obfuscation|obfuscation]] and [[Night magic#Intuition|intuition]] to help a ship avoid enemies – whether pirates, rival ships captains, or legal authorities. Under the effect of Obfuscation conceals noises and manipulates weather phenomena in a subtle way to ensure that ships are not marked by vigilant watchers. Intuition grants the captain a supernatural awareness of when their current course will take them within sight of, or reach of, those who wish them harm.
Furthermore, this same power of intuition helps guide the ship and its crew to places where they are more likely to learn something useful, or seize an opportunity. While it is mostly of use to fleets that are engaged in smuggling goods, it is also valuable on those rare occasions when a ship must navigate enemy waters without being seen, or without engaging a superior naval force.
Unfortunately, there is a drawback to the ritual. It subtly encourages the captain of the fleet to ignore legal restrictions on their behaviour, especially when it comes to possession or use of illegal substances. Indeed, in some quarters, the very existence of this ritual has raised questions about what exactly the "Shark Dodgers" are using it for...
## Common Elements
The ritual involves exploiting the [[Ritual theory#The Law of Dominion|Law of Dominion]] to enchant a fleet by using the captain as an arcane connection. Given the magical emphasis on obfuscation, a [[Coven]] might shroud themselves and the target in some way - wrapping them in cloth, veiling them, or concealing their identity behind masks. The ritual might also be performed in darkness - perhaps with only a single candle - to reinforce the concept of hiding ships while still leaving the crew the ability to navigate. 
Several [[Runes]] resonate with the magic - [[Queros]] the Rune of Plots symbolises covert action, while [[Diras]] the Rune of Secrets highlights the concealment the ritual confers. [[Aesh]] might also be used, surprisingly, as the concept of Wisdom resonates well with the other half of the enchantment, which grants intuition and instinctive navigational abilities to the crew of the enchanted ship.
For an [[Astronomancy|astronomancer]] the [[Astronomancy#Constellations|constellations]] of [[The Key and The Lock#The Lock|the Lock]] and [[The Spider and The Web#The Spider|the Spider]] both have an affinity for the enchantment - representing both that ''things can be hidden'' and ''things are watched by a hidden eye''. Tracing the Lock onto the skin of the target, while drawing the Spider on their forehead brings the resonance of both constellations into pay, concealing and empowering with hidden vision in equal measure.
Likewise certain [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] images are closely tied to the magic of the ritual. [[The Witch]] represents hidden forces, and both [[The Cloak]] and [[The Lantern]] could be employed to highlight different elements of the ritual.
