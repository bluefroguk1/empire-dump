### Effects
The target character gain three additional ranks of endurance. 
The target is also under a Roleplaying effect: you feel physically massive, as if you are much larger than you actually are. It takes a significant effort of will to move quickly or to change your mind once it is made up.
If the target is a [[Briar]], they may choose to temporarily increase the amount of bark on their skin, and may include Thorns as well if they wish although these are also temporary and Generally do not last longer than a few weeks.

## Description
This old ritual is believed to be a remnant of Ushka [[Magic]], although the [[Navarr]] and the [[Suaq]] claim that their people have used similar [[Rituals]] since time immemorial. It fills a target with the unyielding vigour of a massive tree - an oak, ancient pine or similar long-lived plant.
Some suspicious people see the effect that the ritual has on some briars and assume that they run the risk of becoming briars themselves when exposed to this ritual, but there are no recorded cases of this happening.
## Common Elements
An obvious component commonly part of the ritual is ambergelt, although amber and pine resin are equally common. As with many rituals that create an Enchantment, the casters may symbolically give gifts to the target and branches from old trees, amber jewelry and favours or tokens that bear iMages of oak-leaves, acorns or similar plants. Some Dawnish Weaver cabals gird the targets in light or medium armour made of leather or hide while Landskeepers often crown their targets with leaves to show their connection to and mastery over natural forces.
The rune [[Rhyv]] and [[Verys]] are often evoked with this ritual, as is [[The Oak]]. Some ritualists also call on [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Loyalty]], [[Courage]] and [[Vigilance]] - especially [[The Sentinel]] - when they perform ''[[Skin of Bark, Blood of Amber]]''.
