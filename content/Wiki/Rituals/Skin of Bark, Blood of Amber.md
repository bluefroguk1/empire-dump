### Effects

## Description
This old ritual is believed to be a remnant of [[Varushka History|Ushka]] magic, although the [[Navarr]] and the [[Suaq]] claim that their people have used similar [[Rituals|rituals]] since time immemorial. It fills a target with the unyielding vigour of a massive tree - an oak, ancient pine or similar long-lived plant.
Some suspicious people see the effect that the ritual has on some briars and assume that they run the risk of becoming briars themselves when exposed to this ritual, but there are no recorded cases of this happening.
## Common Elements
An obvious component commonly part of the ritual is [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]], although amber and pine resin are equally common. As with many [[Rituals|rituals]] that create an [[Enchantment]], the casters may symbolically give gifts to the target and branches from old trees, amber jewelry and [[Dawn Hearth Magic#Favours|favours]] or tokens that bear images of oak-leaves, acorns or similar plants. Some [[Dawn|Dawnish]] [[Weaver cabal|Weaver cabals]] [[Dawn Hearth Magic#Girding|gird]] the targets in light or medium armour made of leather or hide while [[Landskeeper|Landskeepers]] often crown their targets with leaves to show their connection to and mastery over natural forces.
The rune [[Rhyv]] and [[Verys]] are often evoked with this ritual, as is [[The Oak]]. Some ritualists also call on [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Loyalty]], [[Courage]] and [[Vigilance]] - especially [[The Sentinel]] - when they perform ''[[Skin of Bark, Blood of Amber]]''.
