## Rules
Season|Winter|20
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|10 This ritual targets a [[Druj]] miasma pillar which must be present throughout.
### Effects
This ritual draws on the unstoppable power of [[Winter]] to permanently destroy a [[Druj miasma]] pillar. The physical item is left unharmed, but the essential nature of it is ended. The item ceases to be magical or to have any other spiritual properties and becomes a mundane item.
Any other miasma pillars in the area are unaffected, but they can no longer draw on this pillar for support.
## Description
This ritual was codified in [[Autumn]] 384YE at the Icy Crag of the [[Eternal]] Sun, under the guidance of Ceinwen of the [[Eternal]] [[Family]], the [[Master of Ice and Darkness]]. The ritual was the first to be formulated at the Icy Crag of the [[Eternal]] Sun under the patronage of the Silver Prince – the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Jaheris]] just having become patron of the college following the grand tourney at the [[Summer]] Solstice. It was based on work originally performed by Palaphon Ankarien of [[Urizen]], drawing inspiration from [[Chimes of Annulment]], and placed into [[Imperial lore|Imperial Lore]] by [[The Conclave|the Conclave]] in [[Spring]] 385YE.
The ritual is relatively straightforward in principle. It uses the Winter resonance of ending to simply unravel whatever esoteric power it is that allows a miasma pillar to exert its malign influence over the people of a region. It is a significantly higher magnitude than [[Chimes of Annulment]], and takes longer to cast, but has the crucial benefit that it does not “care” about any other pillars in the vicinity. In the past there have been circumstances where multiple pillars are tied together in a way that means they must all be “depowered” at the same time. Through brute force application of one of the core principles of [[Winter magic]], this circumstance is negated. The pillar is simply ended by a power that cares naught for interconnected webs or mystical chains.
The ritual destroys the power of something that Imperial scholars still do not entirely understand. The miasma is not formed by ritual [[Magic|magic]], and seems more like a great [[Consecration]] woven from dread and despair. All that is sure is that the misshapen monoliths that anchor the effect are vulnerable to destruction by both spiritual and magical means. Yet understanding is not required; just like [[Words of Ending]] can destroy any [[Magical Item|magical item]] regardless of how much the [[Magician|magician]] knows about it, so [[Dreadful Ending]] simply unravels whatever it is that holds the power of the miasma pillar in place.
## Common Elements
This ritual needs to be performed in the presence of a miasma pillar– which almost certainly means the ritualists [[Will|will]] require a source of spiritual strength if they are to be capable of working [[Magic|magic]] while under the influence of the [[Druj miasma]]. The pillar itself is the target – it might be struck with weapons or symbolically “purified” with water or fire. Some covens may trace [[Runes|runes]] on the surface – [[Yoorn]] and [[Mawrig]] have obvious resonances with the ritual, but surprisingly [[Tykonus]] and [[Feresh]] have also been discovered to have resonance. The former most likely represents triumph over the power of the [[Druj]], while the latter appears to amplify the defiance of the ritualists and use it as a weapon against the targeted pillar.
For astronomancers, [[The Drowned Man]] has a clear resonance with [[Dreadful Ending]]. A dramaturgemight favour [[The Doctor]], [[The Prince]], and [[The Garden]]. A blood [[Mage|mage]] [[Will|will]] find that freely given [[Changeling]] blood, or the blood of those who have defiantly resisted the [[Druj]] before, both have potence with regard to this ritual. Evocations of the name of [[Kaela]], or of courageous [[Korl]] may also provide inspiration.
