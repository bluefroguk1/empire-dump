## Description
This ritual is often used in advance of situations where warriors know they [[Will|will]] receive desperate injuries, allowing them to keep fighting. Warriors who find themselves in the thick of battle often embrace it, although in some [[Battles|battles]] it is much more useful than others. An engagement that includes wights, powerful beasts or the cruel weapons of the [[Druj]] [[Barbarians|barbarians]] are all much more likely to result in complications for the warriors involved.
The [[Eternal]] [[Sorin]] is known to offer boons that enhance or [[Empower|empower]] the casting of this ritual, and it is sometimes known as ''That Which Does Not Kill Us'' after a saying allegedly attributed to the callous [[Eternal|eternal]] king.
## Common Elements
Common elements include washing away blood, especially with melted snow, but may also include rubbing soil into the injured location (especially when the caster or the target is a Marcher). [[Paragons and Exemplars]] may be invoked, especially those associated with determination and resilience, and the [[Rune|rune]] [[Jotra]] or [[Rhyv]] is used to encourage fortitude and determination as are the [[Constellations|constellations]] of [[The Oak]] or [[The Drowned Man]].
