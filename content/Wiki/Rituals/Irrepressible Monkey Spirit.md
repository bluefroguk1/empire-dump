## Description
This ritual was first recorded by the Freeborn magician Sagai i Tobera i [[Guerra]], who spent much of his Earlier life as a member of a [[Kohan]] band, and his middle years as a [[Corsair]]. In later life he extended his studies to embrace ritual [[Magic]], and eventually rose to proMinence as the Spring [[Archmage]] of the conclave. He helped codify this ritual shortly before his death at the tragically young age of eight-nine.
This ritual draws on two themes; the spirit and vitality of youth, and the energy and vitality of Spring. It allows a Warrior to [[Heal]] themselves on [[The Battlefield]] without the [[Assistance]] of a physick, chirurgeon or magician, extending their ability to be self-reliant.
Some magicians dislike the comparison between the warriors of [[The Empire]] and the frivolous monkey, despite Sagai's assertion that it is a fine totem for a ritual that grants its targets boundless enthusiasm and reserves of energy as well as the ability to bounce-back from serious injury. Some magicians prefer to refer to it as ''Unfailing Resilience of the Kudzu'' and it is referred to as such in many tomes , especially those used by the vates. In [[Wintermark]] there is a virtually identical ritual called ''The Inevitable Thaw'' while the dignified Highborn magisters employ a version they call ''The Unceasing Ocean''.
Regardless, the ritual is popular with covens of Spring magicians looking for a versatile, if somewhat expensive, benefit to give an allied warrior that they see as being as useful as any Summer Enchantment.
## Common Elements
This ritual is often performed with exuberant and energetic [[Music]], incantations and dance in a style reminiscent of the traditional Guerra style, even if the coven is not made up of Freeborn ritualists. Invocations include drawing on the inevitable power of spring to breed life from dead or barren Winter soil, the mysterious power that surrounds the birth of new living beings, and in many cases the naming of energetic totem creatures such as monkeys. Even calm [[Urizen]] and restrained Highborn covens find it difficult not to invest this ritual with energy and exuberance.
Common elements include the rune of fertility; the evocation of [[The Fountain]] or [[The Stallion]]; a comedic or action-oriented scene with plenty of physical business; and images of Horses, monkeys, and especially winged beasts.
