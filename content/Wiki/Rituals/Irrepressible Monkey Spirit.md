## Rules

### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Character
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
Twice each [[Day|day]] the target can use their choice of unstoppable or relentless as if they know them and without spending any hero points. They can choose each time they use this ability which skill to employ. 
In addition the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: you feel exuberant, energetic and enthusiastic; you become bored easily, and frustrated by any period of inaction or extended concentration. You may choose to respond to any roleplaying effect that would cause you to become weary, despondent or sad by instead becoming exceptionally energetic and immediately doing ''something'' as exuberantly as possible.

## Description
This ritual was first recorded by the [[Freeborn]] [[Magician|magician]] Sagai i Tobera i [[Guerra]], who spent much of his earlier life as a member of a [[Kohan|kohan]] band, and his middle years as a [[Corsair]]. In later life he extended his studies to embrace ritual [[Magic|magic]], and eventually rose to prominence as the [[Spring]] [[Archmage]] of [[The Conclave|the conclave]]. He helped codify this ritual shortly before his death at the tragically young age of eight-nine.
This ritual draws on two themes; the spirit and vitality of youth, and the energy and vitality of Spring. It allows a warrior to [[Heal|heal]] themselves on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] without the [[Assistance|assistance]] of a [[Physick|physick]], [[Chirurgeon|chirurgeon]] or magician, extending their ability to be self-reliant.
Some magicians dislike the comparison between the warriors of [[The Empire|the Empire]] and the frivolous monkey, despite Sagai's assertion that it is a fine totem for a ritual that grants its targets boundless enthusiasm and reserves of energy as well as the ability to bounce-back from serious injury. Some magicians prefer to refer to it as ''Unfailing Resilience of the Kudzu'' and it is referred to as such in many tomes , especially those used by the vates. In [[Wintermark]] there is a virtually identical ritual called ''The Inevitable Thaw'' while the dignified Highborn [[Magisters|magisters]] employ a version they call ''The Unceasing Ocean''.
Regardless, the ritual is popular with covens of Spring magicians looking for a versatile, if somewhat expensive, benefit to give an allied warrior that they see as being as useful as any [[Summer]] [[Enchantment]].
## Common Elements
This ritual is often performed with exuberant and energetic [[Music|music]], incantations and dance in a style reminiscent of the traditional [[Guerra]] style, even if the [[Coven|coven]] is not made up of Freeborn ritualists. Invocations include drawing on the inevitable power of spring to breed life from dead or barren [[Winter]] soil, the mysterious power that surrounds the birth of new living beings, and in many cases the naming of energetic totem creatures such as monkeys. Even calm [[Urizen]] and restrained Highborn covens find it difficult not to invest this ritual with energy and exuberance.
Common elements include the [[Rune|rune]] of fertility; the evocation of [[The Fountain]] or [[The Stallion]]; a comedic or action-oriented scene with plenty of physical [[Business|business]]; and images of horses, monkeys, and especially winged beasts.
