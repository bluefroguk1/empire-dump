### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
Twice each day the target can use their choice of [[Heroic skills#Unstoppable|unstoppable]] or [[Heroic skills#Relentless|relentless]] as if they know them and without spending any [[Heroic skills#Hero points|hero points]]. They can choose each time they use this ability which skill to employ. 
In addition the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: you feel exuberant, energetic and enthusiastic; you become bored easily, and frustrated by any period of inaction or extended concentration. You may choose to respond to any roleplaying effect that would cause you to become weary, despondent or sad by instead becoming exceptionally energetic and immediately doing ''something'' as exuberantly as possible.

## Description
This ritual was first recorded by the [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] magician Sagai i Tobera i Guerra, who spent much of his earlier life as a member of a [[The Brass Coast military concerns#Kohan|kohan]] band, and his middle years as a [[Corsair|Corsair]]. In later life he extended his studies to embrace ritual magic, and eventually rose to prominence as the Spring Archmage of the [[Imperial Conclave|conclave]]. He helped codify this ritual shortly before his death at the tragically young age of eight-nine.
This ritual draws on two themes; the spirit and vitality of youth, and the energy and vitality of Spring. It allows a warrior to heal themselves on the battlefield without the assistance of a [[Surgical skills#Physick|physick]], [[Surgical skills#Chirurgeon|chirurgeon]] or [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]], extending their ability to be self-reliant.
Some magicians dislike the comparison between the warriors of the Empire and the frivolous monkey, despite Sagai's assertion that it is a fine [[Totem magic#Spirit Animals|totem]] for a ritual that grants its targets boundless enthusiasm and reserves of energy as well as the ability to bounce-back from serious injury. Some magicians prefer to refer to it as ''Unfailing Resilience of the Kudzu'' and it is referred to as such in many tomes , especially those used by the [[Navarr Magical Traditions#Vates|vates]]. In [[Wintermark]] there is a virtually identical ritual called ''The Inevitable Thaw'' while the dignified [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[Magister|magisters]] employ a version they call ''The Unceasing Ocean''.
Regardless, the ritual is popular with covens of Spring magicians looking for a versatile, if somewhat expensive, benefit to give an allied warrior that they see as being as useful as any Summer [[Enchantment]].
## Common Elements
This ritual is often performed with exuberant and energetic music, incantations and dance in a style reminiscent of the traditional [[Guerra]] style, even if the coven is not made up of [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] ritualists. Invocations include drawing on the inevitable power of spring to breed life from dead or barren Winter soil, the mysterious power that surrounds the birth of new living beings, and in many cases the naming of energetic totem creatures such as monkeys. Even calm [[Urizen]] and restrained [[Highguard|Highborn]] covens find it difficult not to invest this ritual with energy and exuberance.
Common elements include the [[Bravash|rune of fertility]]; the evocation of [[The Fountain]] or [[The Stallion]]; a comedic or action-oriented scene with plenty of physical business; and images of horses, monkeys, and especially [[Legendary beasts#Winged beasts|winged beasts]].
