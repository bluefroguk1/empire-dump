## Rules
Season|Winter|14
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2  The area to be [[Enchanted|enchanted]] with this ward must be clearly apparent to those within, and without, its bounds.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
This ritual targets a building or well defined, walled area. It must be performed inside that location.
At the completion, the area is warded against undead creatures. An undead creature approaching the boundary is always aware that the area is warded; if it enters it is immediately weakened for as long as they remain in the area. Even undead creatures that are larger-than-human-sized [[Will|will]] be weakened by the power of the ward if they enter it.
__TOC__
When used inside a building, the ward protects the entire structure. Any openings in the structure - doors and windows especially - must be clearly marked with [[Runes|runes]] or symbols of warding. The building must be a reasonably permanent structure, preferably of wood or stone; the ritual [[Will|will]] not work on a tent or other entirely similar structure.
Warding an Area|undead
If undisturbed, the ward remains until the next sunrise.
## Description
This is a powerful ritual that keeps undead or unliving creatures such as husks, wights, wraiths, restless spirits at bay or weakens them if they enter the warded area. Husks and other weak undead will usually hesitate before entering the area; the more powerful the undead creature is, the more it has to lose and the less likely it is to enter the ward if it has any choice. There are stories that suggest that the ward has had some success at keeping some other unnatural creatures at bay; specifically those that are unliving, rather than undead - [[Volodny]] and the grim warriors of the legion of the [[Eternal]] [[Kaela]] are both said to be weakened by this ward, as are some sovereigns. Not many experiments have been done - in the words of the itinerant [[Volhov|volhov]] Pakaanan "''The time to experiment with this kind of thing is when there is an angry sovereign in your village, slaughtering your warriors; if you try to find out earlier, there's a good chance that your experiments will end with an angry sovereign in your village, slaughtering your warriors.''"
In parts of [[Varushka]], and with some places near the Highborn [[Necropolis]] it is common practice to have warding [[Runes|runes]] carved or [[Painted|painted]] above the doors and windows of a house, or on fence posts set up to surround a shrine, church, hall or similar structure. Then, should undead enemies threaten, those unable to [[Fight|fight]] flee to the safe location, which is then warded through the reasonably quick ritual. The alternative - to create the ward afresh each morning - would quickly deplete the mana reserves of an entire [[Coven|coven]] without useful effect, and leave everyone vulnerable should undead creatures attack.
## Common Elements
The most common runes to use with this ritual are the [[Wintermark]] runes [[Yoorn]] and [[Kyrop]] and the common tower symbol associated with [[Vigilance]]. In [[Varushka]] these wards are often supplemented with staring humanoid faces or the heads of geese, while in [[Wintermark]] bird-heads are common on the top of any warding poles. In [[The Marches]] the warding symbols often include stylised figures of guardians, or straw poppets- sometimes with small daggers, needles or shields bound to their limbs. Highborn ritualists usually ensure there is a bell to hand, and bells are rung throughout the warding ritual itself - not least because they serve to warn the community that there is danger.
When performing the ritual, the ritualists often walk the boundaries of the warded area, invoking protection. They often burn incense, or scatter ashes, and check that all the warding symbols are intact. Some ritualists place bowls of fresh- or salt-water at each entry point. Fire is often used as well, especially when the ritual is performed at [[Night|night]].
