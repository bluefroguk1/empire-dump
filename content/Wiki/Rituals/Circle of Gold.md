### OOC Elements
Note that the targeting restriction of this ritual this does not mean "''people who are enchanted with [[Circle of Gold]]''" it is "''people who were targets of the same Circle of Gold ritual''". The targets of a given ritual can only use the stay with me skill on other targets of the same ritual performance.
## Description
Battlefields are dangerous places, and this ritual grants an Enchantment that allows members of a tight-knit band to prevent their comrades succumbing to mortal wounds easily. The dynamic of the group it is used on often influences how the enchantment is perceived - some groups use this Healing as soon as one of their number is incapacitated, while others focus their attention on keeping a certain key member of the group (such as a healer, officer, magician or reckless Warrior) on their feet.
Participants feel a strong urge to stick together, and tend to be very defensive of each other. It has an unfortunate side effect of encouraging groups of warriors to become embroiled in brawls and honour-duels; on more than one occasion a [[Free Company]] captain has been known to restrict his bravos to camp after the ritual is performed to prevent them becoming engaged in a [[Fight]] with other bravos and wasting the enchantment's power.
## Common Elements
As with many similar Rituals, it is common for the targets to share a drink or consume food together, often with a toast or rousing cheer to mark the beginning and end of the ritual. Tokens are often given to the targets, especially tokens of weltsilver or those woven or [[Painted]] with a group insignia. Some ritualists have any weltsilver they plan to use towards the performance of the ritual twisted into rings, one for each target of the ritual.
Many ritualists, especially [[Imperial Orcs]], Marchers and Varushkans, enCourage the participants to recite of some sort of oath of fraternity or mutual protection while joined in a literal circle, arm to arm. IMages and invocations of camaraderie, [[Loyalty]] and mutual respect are common, as is the rune [[Lann]] and the constellation of [[The Chain]]. Scenes involving [[The Captain]] in various guises, often on The Battlefield are often used by dramaturgists to help create an appropraite atmosphere. The evocation of totem beasts that hunt in packs or small groups such as wolves (especially for League or Winterfolk ritualists) are also common, especially winged beasts,
