### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same sect. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 8. Additional characters must be present throughout.
## Description
It is easy to focus solely on the physical and [[War]]-like potence of the [[Magic]] of Summer, but as this Enchantment demonstrates there is much more to the [[Realm]] than that. This ritual enhances and strengthens the spiritual powers of a priest, allowing them to perform more potent ceremonies through the use of additional Liao.
While some priests are concerned about allowing magic to influence them, there are many more who see the strength this ritual can grant in a very positive light. Whether they are creating a potent [[Consecration]] or exorcising a force of corruption, the usefulness of ''[[Chasuble of Majesty]]'' cannot be denied. Indeed, the ritual was first used extensively by Highborn magisters, and some religious magicians point to it as proof that magic is another tool for humanity to use in pursuit of its glorious destiny.
The ritual is named for the travelling garment popular among pre-Imperial pilgrims, although it is also commonly called ''Mantle of Majesty''. A roughly oval piece of tough woollen cloth, with a hole in the centre through which to pass the head, falling below the knees on all sides and gathered up on the arms to allow them to be used freely. It became associated with several Early Chapters and as [[The Way]] spread, so too did the chasuble. While it was eventually replaced by the beautiful robes favoured by high ranking priests today, the chasuble remains popular with some sects, especially among the priests of the [[Assembly]] of the Way.
## Common Elements
This ritual often incorporates religious iMagery of the Imperial Virtues. Some magicians, especially in [[Wintermark]] use the seven accepted [[Runes]] of the faith when they perform the ritual, but others prefer to focus more on [[Symbols of the Way]], especially the seven-spoked wheel.
