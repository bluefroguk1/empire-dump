## Rules
Season|Autumn|3
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2  The target [[Biting Blade]] must be present throughout.
### Effects
This ritual targets a [[Biting Blade]] crafted item that has been used already today. It only targets an item of that specific type.
At the completion of the ritual, the [[Biting Blade#Rules|daily power]] of the biting blade (the ability to call [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]] with the item) is recharged and can be used one more time today.
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional [[Biting Blade|Biting Blades]]. Every additional item increases the magnitude by 2. All target items must be present throughout..
## Description
This specific ritual was added to the body of [[Formulaic ritual#Imperial Lore and the Ritual List|Imperial lore]], and came into common use, due to the activities of a [[Sarvos|Sarvosan]] [[Troupe]] associated with one of the [[The League|League]] [[Free Company|free companies]]. The ''Biting Blades'' company made a point of equipping as many of its members as possible with the crafted weapon of the same name, and gained a reputation for quickly and efficiently crippling enemy warriors on every battlefield where they fought. With the use of this ritual, the magic of the enchanted blades was quickly and efficiently restored, while still permitting the soldiers themselves to benefit from various additional [[Enchantment|enchantments]] such as [[The Swan's Cruel Wing]] or [[Strength of the Bull]].
The ritual endures partly because it represents a broad classification of ritual and serves as an example of one of the limitations of formalised magic. The ritual ''only'' replenishes the power of the [[Biting Blade]]; it has no effect on a [[Vorpal Sword]], a [[Bloodsteel Barb]] or a [[Butcher's Bill]]. In each case, a different ritual would be required to restore the magic of those weapons. Likewise, ritual magic could be used to replenish the use of a suit of [[Tombshroud Guardian]] chain or a [[Caress of Arhallogen]] staff - but in each case a different ritual tailored to the specific [[Enchantment|enchantment]] of the target item would need to be used.
On occasion, when the need is especially great, a [[Groups#Covens|coven]] may use [[Spontaneous magic]] to replenish the powers of a useful magic item, and occasionally formulaic versions of those [[Rituals|rituals]] are developed or discovered in collections of ritual writings. Unless a coven sees an obvious use for the magic, however, it is rare to find coven that masters one of those [[Rituals|rituals]]; recharging enchanted items is much more likely to be within the purview of a lone magician.
## Common Elements
The ritual usually involves a symbolic transfer of power. It may involve careful handling of the target item, evocations of the runes [[Pallas]], [[Lann]] or [[Verys]], or of the names of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] associated with crafting. The ritual often includes the presence of either [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] who can make a [[Biting Blade]] or raw [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. In [[Urizen]] natural light is often focused onto the weapon, while in [[The Brass Coast]] it may be passed over a fire.
