Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Mana site]]
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual diverts all the flows of magic that would normally infuse a [[Mana site]] into provoking the growth of valuable [[Herbs]]. The target produces no crystal mana during the coming season. Instead it produces herbs as if it were a [[Herb garden]] of the same rank. In addition, the magical herb garden produces an additional 14 drams of random herbs.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional mana sites in the same [[Territory]]. Each additional mana site increases the magnitude by 10. The character who controls each mana site must be present throughout the ritual.
