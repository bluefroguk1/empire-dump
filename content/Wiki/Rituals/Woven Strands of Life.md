### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Mana site]]
[[Enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual diverts all the flows of [[Magic]] that would normally infuse a Mana site into provoking the growth of valuable Herbs. The target produces no crystal mana during the coming season. Instead it produces herbs as if it were a [[Herb garden]] of the same rank. In addition, the magical [[Herb]] garden produces an additional 14 drams of random herbs.
Downtime buff
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional mana sites in the same Territory. Each additional mana site increases the magnitude by 10. The character who controls each mana site must be present throughout the ritual.
