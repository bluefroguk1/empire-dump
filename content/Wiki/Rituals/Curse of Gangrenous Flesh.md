### Effects
This ritual creates a Curse that is delivered to a target with a pronouncement of doom: one contributors is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the curse, the target experiences a powerful Roleplaying effect; you feel feverish and unwell; and your skin constantly itches. When you are wounded, your wounds often weep pus. 
In addition, while under the Curse the target is under the effect of [[Venom]]. This venom cannot be removed by any means as long as the Curse remains in effect. Any resources used to try and remove the venom condition are consumed without effect.
You are more likely to suffer infected wounds and similar complications; you should see a referee after any significant engagement (a battle, skirmish or similar) in which you lost hits to see if your wounds are festering. You must see a referee after any engagement in which you were dying (and survived due to some Magical [[Assistance]]).
If you become terminal while under this Curse, you are likely to be overwhelmed with feverish [[Delirium]] and suffer a slow, agonising death as the flesh rots from your bones.
Year Duration
### Removing the Curse
The curse can be removed by certain powerful creatures or items. It can also be alleviated by powerful [[Rituals]] that remove curses of sickness such as the consumable produced by [[Amalgamation of Silver and Gold]].
### OOC Elements
A [[Briar]] can use their natural vitality to shake off the feeling of sickness and fever, but all the other effects apply as normal.
## Description
This dreadful curse can leave its victim prone to fevers, chills and a [[General]] malaise of sickness. Worse, when badly injured their wounds weep pus and quickly become infected. A seriously injured victim of this curse soon lapses into madness and death as they literally rot while still alive - skin and flesh slough from bones, starting with the extremities; the body bloats with gas; the brain is poisoned with the juices of decay and they soon die in fevered agony. This is a very unpleasant thing to see happen, especially to a loved one.
Some victims go out of their way to avoid this horrible fate. Certain Enchantments and items can help to alleviate the fatal effects of the curse, but generally these are only effective for someone who already possesses reserves of bodily fortitude. For many people, the only way to survive this curse is to avoid dangerous situations that might cause serious injury.
## Common Elements
As with many curses this ritual often involves a recitation of the grievances against the target. The ritual often involves the [[Burning]] of meat, or the torture with fire of a poppet that represents the target. Rotting food and drink may be another component, especially meat that is ripe with sickness. The [[Runes]] [[Rhyv]] (to poison the blood), [[Bravash]] (to enCourage sickness to breed and spread)  and [[Kyrop]] (to encourage sickness to weaken the target) may be evoked, as might the constellations of [[The Claw]] or [[The Drowned Man]].
