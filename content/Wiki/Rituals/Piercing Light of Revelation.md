## Rules
Season|Day|2
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 This ritual may target any single creature, item or effect that is present throughout. It may target any [[Enchantment]] on a [[Resource|resource]], region or [[Territory|territory]] within [[The Empire|the Empire]] if performed using the [[Anvil]] [[Regio]]. It may target any [[Enchantment]] on a resource, region or territory outside [[The Empire|the Empire]] with the use of a strong [[Day]] [[Regio|regio]] in the same region or territory.
### Effects
This ritual pierces and drives away obfuscation and deception. It has a number of functions.
* It opens a [[Night Pouch]]. The [[Night Pouch|night pouch]] is destroyed in the process.
* It [[Will|will]] allow an [[Enchanted|enchanted]] [[Night|night]] pouch created with the [[Secrets for the Shadow Courier]] ritual to be opened provided that ''[[Piercing Light of Revelation]]'' is performed at a magnitude equal to or greater than that ritual. The pouch is destroyed in the process.
* It [[Will|will]] permanently remove the Enchantment created by any obfuscation or concealment created by a [[Night ritual]] provided that ''[[Piercing Light of Revelation]]'' is performed at a magnitude at least twice that of the target enchantment. If the ritual does not have sufficient magnitude to remove the shroud, it fails. This does ''not'' reveal information about the magnitude of the shroud.
* It ''may'' permanently remove a [[Curse]] that creates obfuscation or concealment. The magnitude should be at least twice that of the target [[Curse|curse]].
### Additional Magnitude
You may increase the magnitude of the ritual in order to pierce more powerful [[Rituals|rituals]] of concealment.
## Description
This ritual is primarily used for forcing open night pouches. It is quite effective at overcoming the [[Magic|magic]] of an incantation, but finds it harder to force open the more durable pouches created by [[Secrets for the Shadow Courier]]. The ritual will also destroy the effects of more powerful [[Rituals|rituals]] that create concealing or obfuscating enchantments, but the ritual must be performed with overpowering strength - the magnitude must be double that of the target ritual, or the ''Piercing Light of Revelation'' fails. 
In most cases, the ''Piercing Light of Revelation'' is used for destroying night pouches; it is rarely as effective to remove a concealing enchantment as it is to simply force one's way past it using a divination. Exceptions exist - rituals that create durable concealments are generally only pierced by divination for a short time, and there are some such as [[Vale of Shadows]] that need to be removed before the target resource can be conquered.
## Common Elements
This ritual often includes some combination of fire, light, mirrors and the [[Rune|rune]] [[Ophis]], representing the evocation of overpowering might.
