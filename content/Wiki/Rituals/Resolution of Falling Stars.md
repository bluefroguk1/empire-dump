## Rules
Season|Day|6
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2  The ritual targets the caster only; it cannot be performed by a coven.
[[Enchantment]] 
### Effects
The Enchantment provided by the ritual grants the caster the ability to spend a point of personal mana at any time to justify remaining calm and collected when exposed to a roleplaying effect (as if they had spent a hero point). This expenditure of mana has the same restrictions as casting a spell.
While under the effect of the enchantment the character experiences a Roleplaying effect: ''you are centred and focussed and feel Empowered to master your emotions rather than be mastered by them regardless of their source.''
