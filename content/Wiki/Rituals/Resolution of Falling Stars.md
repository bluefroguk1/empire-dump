## Rules
Season|Day|6
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2  The ritual targets the caster only; it cannot be performed by a [[Groups#Coven|coven]].
[[Enchantment|enchantment]] 
### Effects
The [[Enchantment]] provided by the ritual grants the caster the ability to spend a point of personal mana at any time to justify remaining calm and collected when exposed to a roleplaying effect (as if they had spent a hero point). This expenditure of mana has the same restrictions as casting a spell.
While under the effect of the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] the character experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: ''you are centred and focussed and feel empowered to master your emotions rather than be mastered by them regardless of their source.''
