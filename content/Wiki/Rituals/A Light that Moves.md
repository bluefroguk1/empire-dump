## Rules
Season|Day|18
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Congregation]]
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This [[Enchantment]] creates auras that encourage clear communication and a focus on spiritual and philosophical concerns. The target [[Congregation]] swells over the next season and is assessed by the civil service to provide an additional 6 doses of [[Liao]] and an additional 12 votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] at the next event, in addition to normal production. 
In addition, while the congregation remains enchanted the character who owns it experiences a roleplaying effect: ''you feel an urge to communicate as clearly as possible. The more passionately you care about something the stronger the urge to avoid metaphor or circumlocution and speak directly from the heart.''
