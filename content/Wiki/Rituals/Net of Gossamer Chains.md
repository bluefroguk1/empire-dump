## Rules
Season|Autumn|14
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Resource|[[Congregation]]
[[Enchantment]]
### Effects
The heralds that congregate at the [[Enchanted]] Congregation provide additional wealth over the next season, in addition to normal production. At the start of the next season the target congregation provides three measures of Warm ashes in addition to the votes and measures of [[Liao]] they would normally provide.
This ritual will not have any effect if the [[Eternal]] [[Callidus]] is under enmity of the [[Imperial Conclave]].
Season Duration Downtime buff
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional congregations provided the congregations are all controlled by characters from the same coven. Each additional congregation increases the magnitude by 12. The character who controls each congregation must be present throughout the ritual.
### Assurance
This ritual directly invokes the power of the eternal Callidus. If he is ever under the enmity of the Conclave for four consecutive seasons the contract that forms the basis of this ritual is broken. It will no longer be possible to perform it. A new contract could be discussed to re-[[Empower]] the ritual but that would require extensive negotiation.
