## Rules
Season|Winter|150
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|10 The ritual can only be performed in a [[Regio]]. It cannot be performed by a [[Groups#Covens|coven]] who is drawing on the power of that [[Regio|regio]] to enhance their ritual.
### Effects
At the completion of the ritual, the target [[Regio]] is destroyed.
## Description
This ritual ends a [[Regio]] permanently. In theory, a [[Regio|regio]] might be recreated, but there is no guarantee of this. The circumstances that caused the destroyed [[Regio|regio]] to form will need to recur, and it will take about the same amount of time. A lonely graveyard might eventually generate another Winter regio, but it is likely to take as many decades as the original regio took to form, perhaps longer; there is a theory that events that helped empower the original regio do not influence the formation of a later regio.
To all intents and purposes, the regio is gone forever.
Any portal attached to the regio is also destroyed; this usually means that any chamber or hidden realm associated with the regio is also destroyed.
The [[Interdiction#Interdicted Items|magical practice]] of using this ritual to target the [[Regio#The Imperial Regio|Imperial Regio]] at Anvil is interdicted.
## Common Elements
This ritual is often performed with an extended invocation, often with funereal elements such as the ringing of bells. A fire that represents the power of the regio might be built and then dramatically extinguished at the climax of the ritual. The rune [[Yoorn]] is often evoked, as is the constellation of [[The Lock]].
