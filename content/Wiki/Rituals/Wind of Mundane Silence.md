## Rules
Season|Winter|150
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|10 The ritual can only be performed in a [[Regio]]. It cannot be performed by a coven who is drawing on the power of that regio to enhance their ritual.
### Effects
At the completion of the ritual, the target Regio is destroyed.
## Description
This ritual ends a Regio permanently. In theory, a regio might be recreated, but there is no guarantee of this. The circumstances that caused the destroyed Regio to form will need to recur, and it will take about the same amount of time. A lonely graveyard might eventually generate another Winter Regio, but it is likely to take as many decades as the original Regio took to form, perhaps longer; there is a theory that [[Events]] that helped [[Empower]] the original regio do not influence the formation of a later regio.
To all intents and purposes, the regio is gone forever.
Any portal attached to the regio is also destroyed; this usually means that any chamber or hidden [[Realm]] associated with the regio is also destroyed.
The Magical practice of using this ritual to target the Imperial Regio at [[Anvil]] is interdicted.
## Common Elements
This ritual is often performed with an extended invocation, often with funereal elements such as The Ringing of bells. A fire that represents the power of the regio might be built and then dramatically extinguished at the climax of the ritual. The rune [[Yoorn]] is often evoked, as is the constellation of The Lock.
