## Rules
Season|Autumn|15
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 Target Resource|Farm which must already be [[Enchanted|enchanted]] with the [[Strong Ox, Golden Sun]] ritual
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This ritual completely replaces the effect of Strong Ox, [[Golden Sun]].
The [[Farm|farm]] earns an additional 400 rings at the [[Autumn]] Equinox (event 4). The ritual ends at the start of [[Winter|winter]]. 
This spell is intended to be cast at the [[Summer]] Solstice. If the spell is cast earlier in the year, then money that would have been gained from ''[[Strong Ox, Golden Sun]]'' or [[Blessing of New Spring]] is lost. 
If the owner of the [[Resource|resource]] does not attend the Autumn Equinox event, then the additional production provided by the resource is still added to that character's inventory.
### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional farms in the same [[Territory|territory]]. Each additional [[Farm|farm]] increases the magnitude by 12. The character who controls each farm must be present throughout the ritual.
## Description
This spell is intended to be cast at the Summer Solstice, and it is a little less productive if cast earlier in the year and is useless if performed after the Summer Solstice. A farm affected by the ritual [[Will|will]] gather its crops faster, and with less wastage; the weather remains fairer for longer; and all the minor elements that might damage or reduce the value of a crop tend to be mitigated or avoided. Every harvest is a bumper harvest under this ritual; stalks bend practically double with corn and wheat, fruit are oversized and succulent, animals are fat and complacent to the slaughter ... it ensures wealth, [[Prosperity|prosperity]] and comfort for the farmers and their families, as well as plenty left over to sell at a profit. 
As with the [[Blessing of New Spring|blessing of new spring]], this is a very old ritual indeed. The ritual is understandably popular in [[The Marches]], and there are covens of landskeepers who work hard to ensure that they can perform this ritual on many farms simultaneously. Such covens also work to master Blessing of New [[Spring]] and Strong Ox, [[Golden Sun]] if they can, and know that their ability to perform this ritual gives them a useful political tool when dealing with the households and [[Monasteries|monasteries]].
## Common Elements
The ritual brings [[Prosperity|prosperity]], and of all the farm enchantments this is the one that tends to have the most dramatic performances. Ritual performances often include the evocation of the [[Rune|rune]] [[Pallas]]. Hearth magics and symbols associated with strength and agricultural Prosperity are also commonly evoked, such as sweat, salt, honey, ale, milk or grain. Foodstuffs are often shared and a toast drunk, with a libation poured onto the soil in acknowledgement of the role it plays in providing a fine harvest.
In [[The Marches]], a portion of the produce that the farm produced the previous year might be used in the ritual. In a similar way, a Varushkan cabal or circle of [[Wintermark]] magicians might use honey made in an especially prosperous year with fresh-baked runebread, to draw a connection between ''then'' and ''now''.
The [[Magic|magic]] item known as the [[Straw Mask]] can be used to make this ritual easier to perform.
