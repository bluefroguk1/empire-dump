## Rules
Season|Autumn|2
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 This ritual targets an object which must be bonded to a character. Both the item and the character it is bonded to must be present throughout. 
### Effects
This ritual places an enduring magical mark on the item containing the name and face of the character that the item is bonded to.  A [[Detect Magic]] spell cast on the item reveals that it is the 'property' of that character in addition to other information. 
If an item is bonded to more than one person, the mark can identify it as belonging to a [[Banner|banner]], [[Coven|coven]] or [[Sect|sect]], or a member of that band, at the discretion of the ritualist.
[[Rituals]] and effects that obscure information about bonds or auras, such as [[Masque of the Blinded Weaver]], [[Will|will]] obscure the ''[[Mark of Ownership|mark of ownership]]'' from lower-magnitude divinations.
An item may be under multiple ''[[Mark of Ownership|mark of ownership]]'' effects, in which case they are revealed in the order in which they were created.
The ''[[Mark of Ownership|mark of ownership]]'' lasts as long as the object retains its magical qualities and is capable of being bonded to a character.
## Description
This ritual is effective when performed on an item that might be stolen. It makes it difficult for thieves to fence their stolen goods, and more likely that a stolen item [[Will|will]] be returned to them if it is recovered by [[Imperial Law]]. While the mark can be obscured, it is virtually impossible to remove. 
Some ritualists offer the use of ''[[Mark of Ownership]]'' to anyone for whom they perform the [[Create Bond]] spell, as do some [[Magician|magician]]-artisans. This increases the price of the bond, often dramatically, but is often described as offering extra insurance that the item [[Will|will]] be returned to them if stolen.
Some artisans have the ritual performed on their behalf when they complete a masterwork item of which they are especially proud. It is also common for someone who has gained the use of a powerful item through an Imperial position (such as the staff of an [[Archmage]] to have this ritual cast on the object at the start of their [[Tenure|tenure]]. It should go without saying that it is very common to have this ritual performed on an artefact, and a particularly old item may accrue a number of these marks as it passes from hand to hand.
## Common Elements
During the ritual the item and its owner are usually marked in some identical way to help reinforce the idea of ownership. A drop of blood from the owner might be smeared on the item. identical [[Runes|runes]] or symbols (especially the [[Rune|rune]] of wealth and symbols of [[Prosperity]] or [[Loyalty]]) might be [[Painted|painted]] on both owner and item. In [[The Marches]] especially, the target of the ritual is often encouraged to deliver a loud statement of ownership and a [[Challenge|challenge]] to thieves, reinforcing the idea of 'what's [[Mine|mine]] is [[Mine|mine]].'
