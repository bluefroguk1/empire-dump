### Effects
The target may call IMPALE three times each day with any great weapon. In addition they may react to any Roleplaying effect that attempts to coerce them to follow another being by immediately lashing out at the source of that effect instead.
While under the Enchantment they also experience a roleplaying effect: you find it difficult to tolerate anyone who you believe is trying to exert authority over you. In mild cases you might simply ignore them but in situation where you feel especially bUllied or oppressed you find it difficult not to physically lash out at that person.
