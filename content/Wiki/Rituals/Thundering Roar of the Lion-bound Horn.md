[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This [[Enchantment|enchantment]] allows the target to call MASS [[Repel|REPEL]] once during the duration. The character must be able to cast spells to make this call - it explicitly [[Will|will]] not work if they are wearing armour. 
While under the effect of the [[Enchantment|enchantment]], the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: they feel full of boisterous energy, and find it very hard to talk quietly. Indeed, they may have to make an effort not to shout whenever they feel even slightly emotional or stressed. All their passions are stirred up, and their emotions are heightened. Whenever people pay attention to what they are saying or doing, they feel a rush of pleasure. When people ignore them, they feel a burst of irritation and resentment. This is especially potent if they have the [[Changeling]] [[Lineage]]; such [[Characters|characters]] find it difficult to resist trying to be the center of attention at all times.
[[Day]] Duration The power of the ritual can be invoked only ''once'' during this time.
### Additional Targets
The ritual can affect additional [[Characters|characters]] from the same [[Coven|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude of the spell by 35. Additional characters must be present throughout, and each must contribute to the performance of the ritual.

## Description
This [[Battlefield Ritual|battlefield ritual]] allows a powerful magical attack to be unleashed against a group of enemies, hurling them backwards and breaking their formation. It is especially useful when used against shield walls, or against enemies who have taken up defensive positions such as in a gateway or on top of the wall of a [[Fortification|fortification]]
The ritual is named after the legendary [[War|war]]-horn of the [[Eternal]] [[Hayaak]], the Gryphon-king, whose irresistible wrath sweeps all before it.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, a coven often invokes symbols of strength and physical might. Some magicians might invoke the unleashed power of an earthquake, while others look to legendary figures like [[Inga Tarn]] or [[Korl]]. Others invoke the names of eternals such as [[Barien]] or [[Hayaak]]. This is a ritual that creates a violent force, and as such the ritual itself is often violent with sudden movement and discordant or clashing [[Music|music]]. Drums and cymbals are quite appropriate, but the sound of horns being blown can be a particularly powerful element.
Other common elements in this ritual might include the [[Runes|runes]] [[Verys]] or [[Mawrig]], and occasionally the [[Rune]] of Dominion. They might also evoke the powerful roar of the lion, chimera or wyvern.
