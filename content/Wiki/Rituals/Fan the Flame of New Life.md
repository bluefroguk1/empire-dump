## Rules
Season|Spring|6
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Group|two willing characters
[[Enchantment]]
### Effects
Any attempt at conception between the target characters for the duration of the enchantment will be successful. The ritual was originally designed to allow conception where characters were old or otherwise infertile. It will temporarily alleviate infertility, impotence, and Curses that might prevent conception. Where necessary the ritual causes the minimum physiological changes needed to carry a baby to term which last until the baby is born. It can allow characters of the same species to conceive, and is equally effective on humans and orcs. It does not allow characters of different species to conceive together however, so it will not allow conception between an orc and a human. 
The enchantment lasts until the next sunrise, but some of the physiological changes may linger.
### Out Of Character Note
This ritual will allow two characters of the same species to conceive a child. It will work on any two characters, regardless of sexual characteristics. We will not be providing further details about how this ritual works in character; it is below the [[Abstraction]] layer because the sex or gender of your character is your concern. When engaging with this ritual and its effects be mindful of our Conduct rules around sexual activity and performance, sexual consent, and gender identity and be sensitive when roleplaying about issues of fertility, conception, pregnancy, and childbirth.
## Description
This enchantment infuses targets with a trace of [[Spring magic]], filling them with vitality and fertility. While some magicians speculate that a child conceived with the aid of this ritual might be more likely to gain the [[Briar]] Lineage in later life, Imperial scholars have found no concrete evidence that this is the case. [[The Way]] the briar lineage manifests makes it very difficult to get conclusive proof either way.
It's not uncommon for this ritual to be included as part of a marriage ceremony, or any celebration of love where those involved are keen to start a [[Family]]. One word of Warning that is often given to targets who could conceive normally without [[Assistance]] is that the use of the ritual somewhat increases the likelihood of twins, or occasionally triplets. It also burns away the benefits of Herbal contraceptives such as bitterweed.
The ritual is equally effective on animals as it is on humans and orcs, although the expense rarely makes it [[Worth]] the effort of using it to improve the fertility of pigs, oxen, or goats.
## Common Elements
The most common element used in this ritual is the rune [[Bravash]] although there are some magicians who are unsettled by the implication of comparing a human to a goat or other domestic animal. The rune [[Verys]] is sometimes substituted - often with a certain amount of ribald commentary from onlookers.
The attitude towards sex demonstrated by the targets, the performers, or their nation often influence how the ritual is performed. in some parts of [[The Empire]] it is viewed with a certain degree of earthy frankness; in others the power of love will be expounded upon in a subtle and gentle ceremony designed to bring two people into spiritual as well as physical harmony.
As with all [[Rituals]] that target more than one person it is common for the performance to include the sharing of a drink, or for the targets to be symbolically bound together, often with red cord or sashes at one of their wrists. The primal iMagery of fire may be evoked as well - the targets may leap through or pass between fires, representing both the ability of fire to thaw frozen earth and the idea of 'heating the blood' to inSpire passion. In [[The Marches]] especially the targets will walk barefoot across grass fields or meadows, drawing a connection between the land's fertility and their own.
