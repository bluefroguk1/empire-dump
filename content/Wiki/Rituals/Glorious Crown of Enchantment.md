## Description
This Enchantment allows the target to inSpire their allies to strike decisively against their enemies. It is equally potent when driving the foe back with a triumphant charge, or launching a last-ditch defense against overwhelming odds. By speaking words of enCouragement or command, the magician grants strength to the Warriors alongside whom they [[Fight]]; the greenest recruit or the wiliest veteran alike can be granted the strength to strike devastating blows with the power of this enchantment.
The ritual evokes themes of nobility and majesty. Many magicians [[Enchanted]] with this ritual speak of a physical sensation of being "''garbed in power''" - as if they were actually wearing a crown. They tend to carry themselves more proudly, unconsciously enacting mannerisms that their culture associated with leadership or command. This is especially true for magicians of the [[Changeling]] [[Lineage]], some of whom find that this enchantment perfectly complements their instincts to command others. Interestingly, some [[Draughir]] who have experienced the enchantment have reported similar feelings - although in their case the urges fostered by the ''[[Glorious Crown of Enchantment]]'' are a little darker, encouraging them to order their allies around for their own good - and to deal harshly with anyone who questions their instructions.
The ability to replenish the magical prowess granted by this Enchantment should not be underestimated. While it is usually a little tricky to take advantage of this additional power on [[The Battlefield]], the Elixir of Empyrean Art will not only replenish the magician's reserves of personal power but also restore their ability to empower their allies, making that rare [[Potion]] even more powerful in the right hands.
Some Eternals are known to offer boons that further enhance the use of this ritual. [[Eleonaris]] is said to favour those with truly noble souls who make use of it to command their allies. [[Barien]] on the other hand is known to offer those who use the Enchantment to support and encourage allied [[Heroes]] foci that make the ritual easier to perform, or to provide those who make use of it with [[Magic Items]] similar to a [[Roaring Chimera Rod]] to use the ''empower'' spell even more frequently.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes proud or ferocious animals such as lions, bears, gryphons, unicorns or chimerae. Loud, inspirational [[Music]] or the sound of horns are common accompaniments to the performance. 
Any coven, but most especially a coven of witches, is likely to engage in girding the recipient of this [[Magic]]. They might present the target with actual regalia representative of nobility, or mime placing a crown on their head while wrapping them in an inVisible cloak of majesty. [[Anointing]] the head with oil (or for a blood [[Mage]] the blood of a respected leader or changeling) is also particularly appropriate with this ritual. 
Other elements might include the rune [[Feresh]]. A dramaturgic coven may focus their working around an inspirational speech from [[The Captain]], or a more subtle exhortation from [[The Witch]], usually delivered on The Battlefield, and using [[The Ring]] or [[The Blade]]. The astronomantic constellations of [[The Phoenix]] or [[The Chain]] may also empower the effectiveness of this ritual.
