## Description
This [[Enchantment]] allows the target to inspire their allies to strike decisively against their enemies. It is equally potent when driving the foe back with a triumphant charge, or launching a last-ditch defense against overwhelming odds. By speaking words of encouragement or command, the magician grants strength to the warriors alongside whom they fight; the greenest recruit or the wiliest veteran alike can be granted the strength to strike devastating blows with the power of this [[Enchantment|enchantment]].
The ritual evokes themes of [[Summer magic#Nobility|nobility]] and [[Summer magic#Majesty|majesty]]. Many magicians enchanted with this ritual speak of a physical sensation of being "''garbed in power''" - as if they were actually wearing a crown. They tend to carry themselves more proudly, unconsciously enacting mannerisms that their culture associated with leadership or command. This is especially true for magicians of the [[Changeling]] [[Lineage]], some of whom find that this [[Enchantment|enchantment]] perfectly complements their [[Changeling#Roleplaying Effects|instincts]] to command others. Interestingly, some [[Draughir]] who have experienced the enchantment have reported similar feelings - although in their case the [[Roleplaying effects|urges]] fostered by the ''[[Glorious Crown of Enchantment]]'' are a little darker, encouraging them to order their allies around for their own good - and to deal harshly with anyone who questions their instructions.
The ability to replenish the magical [[Summer magic#Prowess|prowess]] granted by this enchantment should not be underestimated. While it is usually a little tricky to take advantage of this additional power on the battlefield, the [[Philtres of the High Peaks#The Elixir of Empyrean Art|Elixir of Empyrean Art]] will not only replenish the magician's reserves of personal power but also restore their ability to empower their allies, making that rare [[Potion]] even more powerful in the right hands.
Some [[Eternal|eternals]] are known to offer boons that further enhance the use of this ritual. [[Eleonaris]] is said to favour those with truly noble souls who make use of it to command their allies. [[Barien]] on the other hand is known to offer those who use the enchantment to support and encourage allied heroes [[:Category:Foci|foci]] that make the ritual easier to perform, or to provide those who make use of it with [[Magic Items]] similar to a [[Roaring Chimera Rod]] to use the ''empower'' spell even more frequently.
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, the coven often invokes proud or ferocious animals such as lions, bears, [[Legendary beasts#Gryphon|gryphons]], [[Legendary beasts#Unicorn|unicorns]] or [[Legendary beasts#Chimera|chimerae]]. Loud, inspirational music or the sound of horns are common accompaniments to the performance. 
Any coven, but most especially a coven of [[Dawn magical traditions|witches]], is likely to engage in [[Dawn hearth magic#Girding|girding]] the recipient of this magic. They might present the target with actual regalia representative of nobility, or mime placing a crown on their head while wrapping them in an invisible cloak of majesty. Anointing the head with oil (or for a [[Blood magic|blood mage]] the blood of a respected leader or changeling) is also particularly appropriate with this ritual. 
Other elements might include the rune [[Feresh]]. A [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgic]] coven may focus their working around an inspirational speech from [[The Captain]], or a more subtle exhortation from [[The Witch]], usually delivered on [[The Battlefield]], and using [[The Ring]] or [[The Blade]]. The [[Astronomancy|astronomantic]] constellations of [[The Phoenix]] or [[The Chain]] may also empower the effectiveness of this ritual.
