## Rules
Season|Day|4
### Performing the [[Ritual]]
Casting time|2 This ritual targets a single opaque container in which are placed a book, pamphlet, scroll, or similar written work, and five ingots of [[Weltsilver]] that must be present throughout.
### Effects
When the ritual is complete, the target written work and the weltsilver disappear and are received by the attendants of the Great Library in the [[Realm|realm]] of [[Day]] who then use the weltsilver to make a copy of the written work.
Once the copying is complete - even the longest tome [[Will|will]] take only an hour - the book [[Will|will]] be returned to the container along with a single vial of prismatic ink in thanks for the [[Gift of Knowledge|gift of knowledge]] provided. The exception is that a book containing a [[Ritual text]] [[Will|will]] ''not'' be returned, or [[Will|will]] be returned with the pages detailing the ritual excised. Those [[Rituals|rituals]] [[Will|will]] then become part of [[Urizen]] lore.
If the book is considered particularly fine - especially if it contains new verifiable information that either is not already included in [[The Library|the library]], or that confirms such information - the [[Eternal|eternal]] may dispatch an additional token of its appreciation.
## Description
This ritual was received as a gift from the [[Eternal]] [[Phaleron]], also known as [[The Celestial Library|the Celestial Library]]. It was proposed for inclusion in [[Imperial lore]] during the [[Winter]] Solstice 383YE by the [[Archmage of Day]], Skywise Gralka (following a failed proposal a year earlier).
Prior to the creation of ''[[Gift of Knowledge]]'', magicians were able to send books and scrolls to [[The Celestial Library|the Celestial Library]] using a very different ritual. Following from the [[Events|events]] of [[Autumn]] 382YE (after an apparent "attack" on [[The Library|the Library]] using the earlier ritual was discovered), [[Phaleron]] withdrew support for that ritual. Instead, it provided ''[[Gift of Knowledge]]'' to then-[[Archmage]] Gancius della Notte di [[Sarvos]] in its place. [[Phaleron]] now seals books sent by the former ritual away, and has them destroyed, while offering appropriate payment for tomes delivered with the correct ritual. 
Though [[The Celestial Library|the Celestial Library]] has drawn closer to [[Urizen]], it should also consider the [[Legacy|legacy]] of the whole, [[The Empire|the Empire]] is defined by its nations. 
There is some concern about this ritual's inclusion in [[Imperial lore]]. During the [[Spring]] Equinox 383YE, in the lead up to a parley between Imperial magicians and the magicians of [[Urizen]], [[Phaleron]] specifically requested that this ritual not enter [[Imperial lore]]. The parley included only magicians from [[Urizen]], and the [[Archmage of Day]], and during the meeting the foundations of what would later become [[Urizen lore]] were laid, culminating in the enfolding of the Grand Library of Canterspire. The ritual has a particular significance for this unique magical technique, allowing texts to be submitted to [[The Library|the Library]] that are then available only to [[Urizen]] magicians. As of the Winter Solstice 383YE, it remains to be seen how the [[Eternal|eternal]] responds to the ritual entering the main body of [[Imperial lore]].
While there is no specific assurance associated with the ritual, [[The Library|the Library]] will presumably choose to withdraw its support if it is used to launch another attack on the [[Eternal|eternal]] - although what form such an attack would need to take to cause harm to a magical building of incomprehensible size is difficult to imagine.
## Common Elements
As with the earlier version of this ritual, the most important element of the [[Magic|magic]] is the written work to be transferred. It is often wrapped in fine silk or cotton, and usually forms the focus of the ritual; sometimes it is passed from hand to hand before being placed in the container, sometimes it is placed prominently in the centre of the ritual. Invocations of great scholars, [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] of [[Wisdom]], and the [[Rune|rune]] [[Aesh]] often accompany the ritual, as do [[Sular]] and [[Ophis]].
Likewise, the opaque container can be an important focus for the [[Magic|magic]]; some magicians or covens might have a specially prepared box or chest that is specifically designed for use with this ritual, decorated with [[Runes|runes]] or astronomantic [[Constellations|constellations]], and often inlaid with Weltsilver. 
Some ritualists wrap the book in a chain, and seal it with a lock during the ritual - the [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Lock]] is unsurprisingly a common element of such [[Rituals|rituals]]. Other ritualists seal the item with a wax seal, often marked with the Rune of Discovery or Rune of Revelation, as appropriate to the nature of the work. 
The completion of the ritual is often signalled by sprinkling seawater on the container.
