### Effects
This ritual creates a [[Curse]] that is delivered to a target with a [[Curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]]: one [[Rituals#Contributors|contributor]] is chosen to deliver the [[Curse|curse]], and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the curse, the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]; you often stumble over your words; the more people who are listening to you or the more authoritative you are being about a subject the harder it is to express yourself clearly.
If the target leads a [[Congregation]] it will quickly shrink as a consequence. During the next downtime period and for as long as the curse persists the congregation provides only half the [[Congregation#Production|liao and votes in the Synod]] it would normally provide.
