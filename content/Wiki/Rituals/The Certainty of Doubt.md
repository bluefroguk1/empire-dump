### Effects
This ritual creates a Curse that is delivered to a target with a pronouncement of doom: one contributor is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the curse, the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]; you often stumble over your words; the more people who are listening to you or the more authoritative you are being about a subject the harder it is to express yourself clearly.
If the target leads a [[Congregation]] it [[Will|will]] quickly shrink as a consequence. During the next [[Downtime|downtime]] period and for as long as the curse persists the [[Congregation|congregation]] provides only half the [[Liao|liao]] and votes in [[The Synod|the Synod]] it would normally provide.
Year Duration
