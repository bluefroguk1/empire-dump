### Effects
This ritual creates a Curse that is delivered to a target with a pronouncement of doom: one contributor is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 
While under the curse, the target experiences a Roleplaying effect; you often stumble over your words; the more people who are listening to you or the more authoritative you are being about a subject the harder it is to express yourself clEarly.
If the target leads a [[Congregation]] it will quickly shrink as a consequence. During the next downtime period and for as long as the Curse persists the congregation provides only half the [[Liao]] and votes in the Synod it would normally provide.
Year Duration
### Removing the Curse
The Curse can be alleviated by certain powerful creatures or items.
