## Description
This ritual was one of the very first to become part of [[Urizen lore]], following the [[Autumn]] Equinox 383YE. Contributed by Mord Thorntarry of the [[Spire]] of Auric Horizen, the ritual was one of those contained in the book ''Meditations''. Written by Callus Strategos, [[Dean of the Lyceum]] during the reign of [[Empress Britta]], the book also contained [[Swords in the Noonday Sun]], [[Hook of the Hoarfrost Guardian]], [[Eyes of the Hills]] and two [[Rituals|rituals]] that had already become part of [[Imperial lore]] - [[Find the Best Path]] and [[Hammers of the Brilliant Shore]].
The ritual draws on the resonance of vitality in a manner reminiscent of the undeniably more potent Imperial [[Skin of Bark, Blood of Amber]]. It fills the recipient with a surge of resilience and good health, both physical and mental; they do not tire as easily; and they enjoy almost supernatural fortitude. complexity and subtlety are both dissonant for the [[Realm|realm]] of [[Spring]], however, and the [[Magic|magic]] used in this ritual has a notable effect on the attitudes of the recipient. They tend to have little patience for immaterial concepts, theories, and ideas, preferring to interact with the world in immediate, concrete, and straightforward ways - much like a highly lineaged [[Briar]].
According to ''Meditations'', this ritual was somewhat controversial when it was first formulated. Callus persevered however and the design apparently drew on an "unpolished" ritual that certain [[Navarr]] vates had been using for centuries. It was initially codified with their scholastic and political support despite criticism from magicians who pointed to [[Strength of the Bull]] as a more efficient way of creating an almost identical effect. When a [[Declaration]] of [[Imperial lore]] was raised in the [[Imperial Conclave]] for this ritual it was defeated. To quote Callus however "''It is all very well saying “it is easier to create this enchantment with [[Summer magic]]!” but the fact remains that, even in the [[Spires|spires]] of my homeland, not everyone is a [[Summer]] [[Magician|magician]], and when you do not understand the lore the enchantment might as well require you to juggle the moon and the sun for all the ease with which you can master it.''"
## Common Elements
As the name suggests this ritual resonates strongly with the astronomantic [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Oak]]. As with many enchantments designed to [[Empower|empower]] a person, performing the ritual often involves adorning or girding the target with objects symbollic of the strength it provides. Freshly gathered leaves or blossoms are particularly effective,  but wholesome food and drink might also be consumed as part of the ritual. So clear is the connection between the ritual and the symbolism of trees that some covens recommend performing the ritual in the presence or shade of a sturdy tree,  the older the better.
