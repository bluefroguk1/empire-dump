## Rules
Season|Spring|50
### Performing the Ritual
Casting time|2 Target Character The target character must be a [[Rituals#Contributors|contributor]] participating in the performance of the ritual.
[[Enchantment|enchantment]]
### Effects
This [[Enchantment|enchantment]] allows the target to call [[Calls#Mass Calls|MASS]] [[Calls#VENOM|VENOM]] once during the duration. The character must be able to cast spells to make this call - it explicitly will not work if they are wearing armour. 
While under the effect of the [[Enchantment|enchantment]], the target experiences a [[Roleplaying effect]]: their body seethes with magical power that makes it difficult to relax or concentrate. The longer they spend in inactivity (talking, sleeping, waiting), the worse this gets. It may include feverish symptoms (as if the blood or body were on fire), a whole body itch (as if invisible insects were burrowing beneath the skin), or aching bones and inflamed of the joints. This effect is particularly pronounced if the target has the [[Briar]] [[Lineage]]; a briar under the influence of this enchantment finds it difficult to stay still for extended periods, and feels the urge to take decisive action ''right now''.
Day Duration The power of the ritual can be invoked only ''once'' during this time.
### Additional Targets
The ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude of the spell by 30. Additional characters must be present throughout, and each must [[Rituals#Contributors|contribute]] to the performance of the ritual.

## Description
This [[Battlefield Ritual|battlefield ritual]] allows a powerful magical attack to be unleashed against a group of enemies, filling them with supernatural poison and feverish sickness. The power to release a wave of venomous spring magic is an [[Enchantment]], allowing the magic to be stored for a time before being employed at the most tactically appropriate moment. The ritual has a strong affinity for the caustic material [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]]. A coven can take advantage of this affinity to help reduce the difficulty (and cost) of performing the ritual.
This ritual has a number of uses, but two are worth noting. Firstly, it is useful when facing groups of creatures with regenerative or supernatural-healing abilities. This might mean exotic beasts such as undead, [[Vallorn|vallornspawn]], but even a barbarian force might qualify if it is supported by a number of magicians who are making good use of [[Heal|healing spells]]. Secondly, it is a very effective terror tactic. Those caught in the arc of the spell are left in no doubt as to the merciless intent of their opponents; no prisoners will be taken in this engagement. That fact alone is sometimes enough to break the morale of an enemy, or at least encourage them to withdraw until they can [[Purify|remove the venom]].
## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, a coven often invokes symbols of poison and disease. Some magicians prefer to weave incantations involving poisonous plants and venomous animals, while others may work spells that suggest disease, sickness and pestilence. [[Eternal|eternals]] such as [[Arhallogen]] and [[Llofir]] may be invoked, or the names of specific malignant plagues could be used.
The target of the ritual is always a contributor, and the ritual should reflect that. Some practitioners of [[Blood magic]], for example, make small cuts on the palms of the coven which are pressed against similar cuts on the target, symbolically focusing power in one of their number. Others might prepare a poisonous (or symbolically poisonous) brew, and cause the recipient of the enchantment to consume it at the climax of the ritual. 
Other common elements in this ritual might include the runes [[Mawrig]], [[Naeve]] or [[Yoorn]], the evocation of [[The Claw]] or [[The Drowned Man]], the slow ringing of heavy bells suitable to a funeral, or evocations of the [[Legendary beasts#Hydra|hydra]], .[[Legendary beasts#Dragons |hydra]], [[Legendary beasts#Dragons, Wyverns and Wyrms|wyvern]] or the basilisk (especially for the [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]], [[Highguard|Highborn]] and [[The League]]).
If the coven intends to draw additional power through the use of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]], it is not uncommon to dilute the lye in water and use it to paint designs on the skin of the target. If the concentration is high enough, the caustic solution will cause slightly painful minor burns that fade over the course of an hour or so - tracing runes in this way is especially appropriate.
