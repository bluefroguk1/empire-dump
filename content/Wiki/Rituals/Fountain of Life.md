## Description
''[[Fountain of Life]]'' allows a magician to perform three potent healing incantations as if they knew them. Many ritualists focus entirely on mastering [[Rituals|rituals]], and this [[Enchantment]] allows them to 'unlock' their reserves of personal mana and use them in dangerous situations to [[Heal|heal]] their companions. It also sees some use in allowing a magician who already possesses a good store of personal mana to expand their versatility.
This spell grants an almost instinctual ability to understand the incantations it provides; magicians say there is no real sense that they understand the intricacies of the spells in question. Rather they possess an intuitive, instinctual awareness that they can shape and channel magical energy to bolster and heal their friends, that fades away when the enchantment ends. Some magicians feel a strong urge to use their new healing powers at the first [[Opportunity|opportunity]], as often as possible, until they are entirely spent. These individuals need to maintain a strong grip on their instincts to avoid expending all their energy in a frenzy of healing, and ensure that their new abilities are employed where they [[Will|will]] do the most good. 
## Common Elements
This ritual sometimes involves people who already possess the spell knowledge it imparts, or even items such as a [[Staff of Life]] or [[Mazzarine Spindle]], and symbolically sharing that magical knowledge with the target. It is also common to paint [[Runes|runes]] such as [[Rhyv]], [[Aesh]] or [[Irremais]] or occasionally [[Hirmok]] on the hands of a target; to evoke the power of [[The Fountain]]; or to cut the target and allow a symbolic sacrifice of blood to fall onto natural vegetation.
