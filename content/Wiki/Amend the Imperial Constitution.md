__NOTOC__
So that we can truly call ourselves an equal society of sapient beings afforded equal treatment under our Constitution.

Amend the Imperial Constitution

Replacing:
“In concord with the representatives of the great nation of humanity, we declare the founding of our Empire.”

With:
“In concord with the representatives of our great nations, we declare the founding of our Empire.”

This is a Constitutional motion that will require a two-thirds majority vote of the Empire’s senators and ratification by The Throne to pass.

Let us make history today, and complete the work begun by the exemplars of Ambition and of Courage, Thrace and Ahraz. Let us enshrine the equality of Imperials Orcs and Imperial Humans at the very heart of our Empire’s principles.
Proposed by Skarsind, Seconded by Segura
