As strong as iron and as supple as a river reed. These great trees are the sinews of our world.
## Overview
[[Weirwood]] is a highly precious golden wood prized for its straight grain, flexibility, and strength. The durability and natural resistance to fire of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] make it particularly prized in the building of boats. It is one of [[The Key|the key]] [[Materials|materials]] used by the [[Imperial Senate]] to resupply armies or to [[Commission]] new buildings and is a vital component of many [[Opportunities|opportunities]].
[[Weirwood]] is bought and sold in Imperial wains. These weigh about 500kg, with a volume of half a cubic metre. Due to the vast weight, trading is done in [[Bourse]] Certificates provided by the civil service.
## Bourse Certificate
[[Weirwood]] is too bulky to easily transport to [[Anvil]]. To help facilitate trade across [[The Empire|the Empire]], the [[Imperial Civil Service|Imperial civil service]] provide Bourse certificates for every wain. Citizens can trade these certificates safe in the knowledge that they can be exchanged for a wain of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] when the need arises.
## Uses of Weirwood
### Commissions
Weirwood is primarily useful as a building material. [[The Senate]] can [[Commission]] a range of buildings that fortify, enrich or uplift [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Weirwood is usually required in the construction of:
* [[Imperial navy|Imperial Navy]] 
* [[Ministry]] - a [[Ministry|ministry]] built with weirwood would allow the purchase of [[Herbs|herbs]].

*[[Fleet]] - each upgrade increases military strength of the unit is increased by 20
*[[Herb garden|Herb Garden]] - each upgrade gives 2 additional herbs, as chosen by the owner. 
*[[Farm]] - each upgrade gives 36 additional rings per season
To upgrade a [[Resource|resource]] requires Imperial wains of weirwood equal to the level the resource is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 [[Forest|forest]] costs 2 Imperial wains of weirwood, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.

### Recent [[History]]
The [[Great Forest at Reikos]] was seized by the [[Druj]] [[Barbarians|barbarians]] in 367YE. In  Winter 379YE, the seat was [[Liberated|liberated]] by [[Imperial armies]]. The Highborn attempted to have this allocated as a National seat, but the [[Senate]] appointed it an Imperial seat in [[Spring]] 380YE
In Winter 380 YE,  Dawnish witches attacked the shipment from the [[Weirwater Vales]] , and took five wains of that season's output.
In Spring 381YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] built a set of dedicated docks, trading with [[Magician]]-Prince of PÓ“rnau Principality in Eastern [[Jarm]]. The resultant [[Pallas]] Docks depends on [[The Empire|the Empire]] retaining good relationship with Jarm. 
In [[Autumn]] 381YE, the Senate permitted the  [[Great Forest Orcs]] to work the trees in the [[Thimble]] for [[The Empire|the Empire]] in return for a bounty of four wains of weirwood each season. This means there is no costs to the Senate for the running of the [[Forest|forest]] and orcs could use the weirwood they gained to create [[Herb|herb]] gardens and similar in [[Therunin]]. 
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions|sanctions]] on the [[Principalities of Jarm]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost|cost]] of purchasing weirwood through the [[Pallas]] Docks increased by roughly a fifth.
In Spring 383 YE, Varushkan merchants offered to pay 1000 thrones to turn the [[Hunt of Alderei the Fair]] National instead of Imperial.
