Lyrics by Jude 

Tune - 3 little monkeys


Five little ploughboys marching off to war
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his brush and one forgot his comb
Five little ploughboys had to march back home 

Four little plough boys marching off to  war
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his  pouch and one forgot his sack
Four little ploughboys had to march right back 

Three  little ploughboys marching off to war
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his ink and one forgot his pen 
Three little ploughboys turned around again

Two little ploughboys marching off to war
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his hawk and one forgot his hound
Two little ploughboys had to turn around


One little ploughboy marching off to war
Pitchfork boldly held before
'Now it's getting dark come in,' his mummy said
One little plough boy went home to his bed
