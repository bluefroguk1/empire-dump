## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 

 

### Effects

The target can use [[Heroic skills#Stay with Me|stay with me]] twice a day as if they know the skill without spending any [[Heroic skills#Hero Points|hero points]]. 



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banner|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 6. Additional characters must be present throughout.

### Option
Any caster who has mastered the ritual may choose to substitute [[True Vervain]] for crystal mana when contributing to it. Every 2 doses spent counts as 1 crystal mana when contributing to the ritual.

## Description

Sometimes a [[Surgical skills#Chirurgeon|chirurgeon]] finds that time is against them, and that life hangs in the balance. Sometimes a warrior needs to get a comrade to safety ''now'', before the enemy can kill them both. The ''Chirurgeon's Healing Touch'' ritual gives immediate options to the target, allowing them to quickly get an ally on their feet and moving under their own steam.

To use the healing power provided by this ritual, the recipient usually breathes deeply onto their cupped hands, or rubs them swiftly together to make them warm, then places them on the forehead of their injured companion. Warmth and vitality then flows from the lungs and heart, through the hands, into the patient and jolts them back to life.

## Common Elements
As with many healing rituals, blood and water are common elements, but so is the concept of breath and breathing. Washing the hands with water or wine is common, as is the inhalation of steam especially steam from a bowl where healing herbs are brewed. The [[True Vervain]] herb is especially valuable as a symbol for this ritual, and the pungent juice of crushed leaves is often used as a way to boost the power of the ritual - while it is rare to see a [[Groups#Covens|coven]] use large amounts of true vervain (it is rarely effective to consume the healing power of the herb to grant healing powers), it is sometimes used to make the ritual more accessible to smaller groups. 

Invocations using the names of great healers, legendary beasts such as the [[Legendary beasts#Firebird|firebird]], and and the constellation of [[The Fountain]] are all popular images to use with this ritual. Runes such as [[Rhyv]] may be used, but the healing might also be evoked through the [[Aesh|rune of thought]] or [[Feresh|the rune of majesty]].
