## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
  

Performing this ritual requires a number of rings of [[ilium]] equal to the level the forest will be upgraded to.



### Effects
This ritual [[enchantment|enchants]] a forest. It requires a number rings of ilium equal to the level the forest will be upgraded to (one more than the current rank of the forest). When the ritual is complete the illium is consumed and over the next few weeks the power of the forest is increased - it is permanently [[forest#upgrades|upgraded]] one level. 

The enchantment does not prevent a character from upgrading their forest during downtime using the normal rules.

The owner of the forest experiences a [[roleplaying effect]] while their forest is enchanted:  you feel an urge to challenge traditional understanding and hearsay, and to pick apart the "accepted truths" that people take for granted.
