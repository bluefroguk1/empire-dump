### Overview
The High Herbalist of Sybella is an [[Imperial title]] [[Construct_Ministry_in_Sybella|created]] by the Highguard Civilian Commissioner in Summer 380YE. It is responsible for overseeing the [[#Sybella Cross Physician's Hall|Sybella Cross Physician's Hall]], a [[ministry]] built at [[Bastion#Sybela|Sybela]] in [[Bastion]]. When it was established, the expectation was that the hall would give preferential treatment to the [[Anvil#The_Anvil_Hospital|Anvil Hospital & Imperial School of Medicine]] [[Imperial sodality|sodality]], but it remains to be seen whether successive High Herbalists adhere to this vision for the Physician's hall.
### Responsibilities
The High Herbalist is expected to supply herbs at a preferential rate to the [[Anvil#The_Anvil_Hospital|Anvil Hospital & Imperial School of Medicine]] - although of course this is merely an expectation and exerts no legal restrictions on the holder of the title who is free to do with the resources provided by the ministry as they see fit. If the Physician's Hall were ever threatened, it would be the responsibility of the High Herbalist to deal with those threats - but also to deal with any [[opportunity]] to expand the Hall, or work more closely with the [[Surgical skills#Physick|physicks]], [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|apothecaries]], and herbalists of [[Bastion#Sybella_Cross|Sybella Cross]].

The Sybella Cross Physician's Hall is a [[ministry]]. The High Herbalist can purchase quantities of herbs at a set price. The High Herbalist makes their decision how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

### The ''Kruidenkenner''
In Autumn 383YE, the Senate chose to [[Expand_the_Kruidenkenner_Magazjin|expand]] the [[Kruidenkenner_Trademaster#The_Kruidenkenner_Magazijn|Kruidenkenner Magazjin]] in [[Necropolis]]. As a consequence, grateful merchant-herbalists of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] have made their merchandise available to the High Herbalist at what they consider ''reasonable prices''. This additional track will remain available as long as the Empire's good relations with the ''Kruidenkenner'' and the Delves continue.

==Appointment== 
The High Herbalist of Sybella is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 

The title can be held by a citizen of Highguard. The High Herbalist has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Highborn [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Sybella Cross Physician's Hall
Built in [[Bastion#Sybella_Cross|Sybella Cross]] in [[Bastion]], the Physician's Hall purchases herbs from citizens and provides medicinal support to the inhabitants of Sybella Cross. As one of the richest towns in Bastion, and a central hub for trade, the Hall is ideally placed to take advantage of herb traders traveling to and from [[Urizen]] and [[Therunin]], or those en route to or from the new [[Gardens of High Chalcis]] in Reikos.

Much of the trade at the Physician's Hall is between private citizens, but the High Herbalist and their representatives often receive first refusal or access to special opportunities to acquire herbs at bargain prices.

The Hall also serves as an academy for training herbalists, physicks, and apothecaries. While it does not rival the great physicians schools of pre-[[Druj]] [[Reikos]], it has attracted students and teachers from across Bastion, [[Casinea]], and [[Necropolis]] - especially in the wake of the [[Iron_and_wine|coronation address]] of [[Empress Lisabetta|Imperatrix Lisabetta]].
