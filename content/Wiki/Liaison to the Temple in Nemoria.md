## Overview
The Liaison to the Temple in Nemoria (or ''Grand PrÃªtre des Sept Seigneurs de la Vertu'' as the [[Asavean Archipelago|Asaveans]] insisted on calling it) was an [[Imperial title]] charged with maintaining good relations between the priests at the [[Construct_Temple_of_the_Way_in_Nemoria|Temple of the Way]] in [[Asavean_Archipelago_ports#Nemoria|Nemoria]] and the Asavean populace.

## Responsibilities
The Liaison was responsible for supporting the Temple of the Way in Nemoria, and maintaining the relationship between the [[Imperial Synod]] and the priests serving there. This was most likely to involve smoothing over any conflicts, and dealing with any problems of [[opportunity|opportunities]] related to the Temple. 

## Powers
### Point of Contact
Imperial priests serving in Nemoria looked to the Liaison to resolve issues between themselves and the Asaveans, in conjunction with the [[Ambassador to Asavea]] and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

The Liaison was able to donate [[liao]] to the temple in Nemoria, and in return received gifts and recompense in a manner identical to that of a [[ministry]]. The Liaison spent their liao and made their choices during downtime from their character page. Liao was removed from, and resources were placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime was processed.

## Appointment
This title was appointed during the Winter Solstice. The Liaison was [[appointment|appointed]] by a [[judgement]] of [[Appointment]] in the [[the Brass Coast|Freeborn]] [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National assembly]]. 

Any Freeborn citizen was able to hold this title. They could have been revoked by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Freeborn Assembly, and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## The Temple of the Way in Nemoria
The temple is built of white granite, patterned after the Basilica of Seven Doors in [[Bastion#Bastion.2C_the_White_City|Bastion]], albeit on a smaller scale. An outer ring of seven shrines, each [[consecration|consecrated]] to one of the seven virtues, surround a single great hall beneath a white marble dome dedicated to the Way itself. Where the Basilica in Bastion stands at the heart of a public park, the Temple in Nemoria is surrounded by a marble-paved plaza with four beautiful fountains.

The shrines dedicated to each of the virtues contain prominent statues of the [[Paragons_and_exemplars#Renowned_Paragons|renowned paragons]], and smaller statues of the [[Paragons_and_exemplars#Renowned_Exemplars|renowned exemplars]]. The central hall, dedicated to the Way, contains fewer statues. Used as an auditorium and lecture theatre, the space is intentionally kept empty but the walls of the Hall of the Way are decorated with a number of beautiful marble frescos depicting the mysteries of the Labyrinth, and the [[The_Doctrines_of_the_Faith|Doctrines of the Faith]]. Regular sermons are held here for the benefit both of local followers of the Way (a minority in Asavea), and guests interested in learning more of the Imperial faith.

While there is some animosity from some of the local priests - the Way is closely associated with various slave rebellions and with the hated [[Sumaah Republic]] in the eyes of many Asaveans - the temple proved moderately popular with the Nemorian populace. This is most likely due to its novelty value than from any deep interest in learning more about the foreign religion, however. This novelty value persisted until Summer 383YE when [[Through_my_sails#Ruined_Buildings|news reached the Empire]] than an angry mob had attacked the temple and seriously damaging it, injuring and in one case killing the priests assigned to support it.
