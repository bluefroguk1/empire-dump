### Overview
Initially raised from the people of [[Bregasland]], there is still a strong territorial bias in the soldiers of this army. The [[Strong Reeds]] is notorious for the dour, stubborn nature of the soldiers who serve under its banner. The Strong Reeds have a long history of resisting [[Jotun]] aggression against the marshes, and have several times in their history fought alongside the [[Wintermark]] armies in [[Kallavesa]].  In recent years they have embraced much older, [[Army qualities#Secretive|secretive stratagems]], relying on skills honed by years in the fens to perfect the art of scattering into a territory and lay low in appropriate [[territory]].

The second Marcher General leads the Strong Reeds army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Winter solstice each year.

## Army Quality : Secretive
The Strong Reeds were a notoriously [[Army_qualities#Hard_Bitten|hard bitten]] army, making their enemies pay in blood for every inch of land ceded. In recent years, however, they have embraced much older, [[Army_qualities#Secretive|secretive]] stratagems, relying on skills honed by years in the fens to perfect the art of scattering into a territory and lay low in appropriate territory.
