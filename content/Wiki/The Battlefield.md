The battlefield is a [[Dramaturgy#The Thrones|throne]], a location used in [[dramaturgy]] that represents both a setting and a Realm of magic.

Realm: Summer.

Setting: The Battlefield is most commonly presented as either a military camp, or as a castle or fortification. Themes of war, conflict, strength and the threat of death are all strengthened on the battlefield. The story might involve preparations for a battle, the arming of a mighty warrior or the fight itself (often a duel) and its aftermath. 

Characters: [[The Captain]] and [[The Bishop]] are strong characters in this setting; they are often larger-than-life, taking on iconic roles as figureheads or representations of patriotic, political or religious themes. The Captain leads, and the Bishop inspires; it is here that they are at their most majestic. 

Magical Style: This is often a location where someone is strengthened, or commits themselves to action. 

Rituals that create [[enchantment|enchantments]] of strength, [[Combat skills#Endurance|endurance]] or that grant martial abilities such as [[The Hammer of Thunder]] or [[Alignment of Mind and Blade]] are made stronger here. Any ritual that targets a [[military unit]], fortification, campaign army or [[Groups#Banners|banner]] may be performed in this setting.
