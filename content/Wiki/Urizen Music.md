## The Music of Urizen

### Style summary
The Urizen musical tradition mirrors their tranquil, philosophical approach to life. More in meditation than performance, traditional Urizen musicians gather to improvise fluid, shifting melodies and harmonies around a series of repetitive themes, usually choosing a concept such as 'tranquility', 'hope' or 'grief' around which to base their compositions. They favour picked strings, tuned percussion and light, breathy woodwind, though any instrument can be played as part of the soundscape.

Real world inspiration includes gamelan, minimalists such as Phillip Glass and Ludivico Ianoudi, Vangelis and Mike Oldfield, though with acoustic rather than electric instruments.

### A musical tradition
Urizen does not have a popular concert tradition. However, many Stargazers who are also musicians use musical improvisation and composition to structure their ritual magics; one such major tradition is the [[Silutarian Method]], which utilises the connection between musical modes and the realms of magic.

### Further examples

### Songs
Traditionally, Urizen has not had a significant song tradition of its own, although bards have happily purloined the songs of other nations to sing in bars and around campfires. See [[Music]] for songs known throughout the Empire. 

Children still sing songs and nursery rhymes, such as the following: [[Hungry Goat]]

Very recently, however, there has been a developing vogue for musical settings of Urizen lyric poetry. The pieces are usually repetetive, cyclical and reflective, as befits the Urizen outlook.

*[[The Stargazer's Song]]
*[[Cold, Crisp Air]]
*[[From the Spires Tall]]

### Instrumentation
Bells, glockenspiels, [http://www.handpan.org/ Hand pans], hammer dulcimer, soft pipes, long notes from bowed instruments or drone instruments such as singing bowls or wine glasses.

### Other performance traditions
Performers in Urizen more commonly recite poetry than sing. There is more information about Urizen art [[Urizen_Culture_and_Customs#Art|here]].

### How to adapt your repertoire
* Take any tune and repeat a phrase over and over, allowing others to improvise around it.
