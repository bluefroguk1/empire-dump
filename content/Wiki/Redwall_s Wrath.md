## Description
The Redwall's Wrath is a dangerous weapon when used by a [[heroism|hero]] of [[Wintermark]]. The [[Magic_items#Schema|schema]] was recovered during a conjunction through the Sentinel Gate to [[A_wandering_fire#Borderline_.28Conjunction.29|rescue]] Yantl the Storm Runner. Originally known as the ''Linebreaker's Axe'' the weapon was renamed in honour of the fallen warrior Sven Red Wall, who fell in Liathaven during the Winter Solstice 384YE, by Kali Keen-Eye who passed the schema to [[Wintermark_Egregore#Sulkavaris|Sulkavaris]] to be added to Runesmith's Law.

The original schema suggested use of the runes of [[Mawrig|Storms]], [[Verys|Might]], [[Jotra|Battle]], and [[Tykonus|Victory]]. The inclusion of Redwall's Wrath has seen a stir of enthusiasm amongst the [[Suaq]] who have shown a great deal of interest in what could prove to be a very cunning weapon.

## Rules

* Effect: You may spend a [[Heroic skills#Hero Points|hero point]] to call [[Calls#STRIKEDOWN|STRIKEDOWN]] with this one-handed weapon.
* Materials: Crafting a Redwall's Wrath requires 18 ingots of [[tempest jade]], 11 ingots of [[green iron]], 5 ingots of [[orichalcum]], and 5 measures of [[dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
