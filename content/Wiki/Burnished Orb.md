## Description
Few ritual tools are as splendid as those associated with the practice of Summer magic. This valuable item is usually crafted in the form of a metal orb inlaid with tempest jade and usually decorated with gold, silver and precious gems. It is infused with potent enchantments and attuned to the realm of Summer. A [[Groups#Covens|coven]] can use it to draw on the power contained in ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and align it with their own magic, allowing them to reduce or in some cases replace the need for crystal mana when performing Summer rituals.

A Burnished Orb most often takes the form of an actual 'covenstone' wielded by one of the magicians in a ritual, but it is not the only shape appropriate to this item. Some covens possess burnished orbs that take the form of a bowl or chalice, while others possess a literal crown that is worn by one of the ritualists to display the aspects of majesty and potence that are core to many Summer rituals. The item is often marked with [[Runes#Runes of Summer|runes]]; or with images associated with power and strength such as physically strong animals (stags and eagles being the most common); clenched fists; castles; or the accoutrements of war. Regardless of the precise form it takes, a coven that uses it is careful to ensure that it plays a central role in their ceremonies - in addition to its ceremonial use it is a symbol of their unity of purpose and their coven oath.

## Rules

* Effect: Members of the coven who are performing a Summer ritual they have mastered may use [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] in place of crystal mana. Every two measures of orichalcum spent count as one crystal mana.
* Materials: Crafting a Burnished Orb requires seven ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], four ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and three measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
