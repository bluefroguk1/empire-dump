## Overview
The Arcane Architect is an [[Imperial title]] appointed by the [[Imperial Conclave]]. The title was [[Create title of Arcane Architect|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Autumn Equinox 379YE.

When the title was initially created, it had an unlimited power to [[commission]] the construction of mana structures. The Senate [[Amend powers of the Arcane Architect|amended]] the power to once per season as part of an administrative motion. The Senate voted to further [[Amend powers of the Arcane Architect Autumn 383YE|amend]] the powers of the Arcane Architect during the Autumn Equinox 383YE by extending their power of commission to ministries and great works.

==Responsibilities== 
The Arcane Architect is responsible for supporting the [[rituals|ritual]] [[Magical skills#Magician|magicians]] of the Empire in virtuous application of mana.

## Powers
### Commission construction of mana structures
Once per summit, the Arcane Architect can [[commission]] the construction of sinecures, ministries, or [[great work|great works]] that produce crystal mana. The materials required for construction are provided by the Arcane Architect. In the case of a [[sinecure]] or [[ministry]] this would create a new [[Imperial_title|Imperial title]], one that is appointed by [[Candidacy|Declaration of Candidacy]]. These titles must be Imperial titles, rather than national titles (meaning they can be held by any citizen). As with any other title appointed through the Imperial Conclave, these subsidiary titles cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by any assembly of the [[Imperial Synod]].

To use this power, the Arcane Architect provides an [[Senate_announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, and then presents the announcement to the Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Arcane Architect. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[veto]] over the Arcane Architect's commission.

In Summer 382YE, the civil service raised [[382YE_Summer_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Administrative|an administrative motion]] to confirm that the Arcane Architect could commission sinecures that would produce [[vis]], as well as those that would produce crystal mana. The Senate confirmed this was their intent.

### Toad Wand
During the Winter Solstice 379YE, the [[eternal]] [[Sadogua]] pledged to provide a [[magic items|magic item]] to the Arcane Architect. This item takes the form of a wand surmounted by a toad. Sadogua has pledged to re-empower the wand every year during the Winter Solstice, as long as he enjoys the [[Alignment#Amity|amity]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]]. The powers of the wand have not been made public knowledge.

## Appointment
The appointment, replacement, or removal of the Arcane Architect is made by the [[Candidacy|Declaration of Candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]].

The Arcane Architect serves until they are replaced by another magician using the Declaration of Candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]].
