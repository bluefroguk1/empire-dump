This goes to the tune of Scot's Whae Hae - a video of the original can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgskbClWZ68 here]


Marchers who have sown your grain
Reaped it back to grow again
Now we march from field and fen
On to victory 

Now's the day, and now's the hour; 
See the front o' battle lour; 
See approach barbarian power- 
Chains and slavery!

What will be a traitor knave? 
What can fill a coward's grave? 
What so base as be a slave? 
Let him turn and flee! 

For the Marches land and law, 
Freedom's sword will strongly draw, 
Free-man stand, or Free-man fa', 
Let them on wi' me! 

By oppression's woes and pains! 
By their slaves in servile chains! 
We will drain our dearest veins, 
But they shall be free! 

Lay the proud usurpers low! 
Tyrants fall in every foe! 
Liberty's in every blow!- 
Let us do or die!
