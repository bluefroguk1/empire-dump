## Description
The Mask of the Mountebank empowers a ritualist with the ability to change someone's appearance through the power of [[the Twilight Masquerade]]. The ritual is often used to grant the outward features of a [[lineage]] not the target's own - or to disguise and conceal lineage features granting the recipient the appearance of an unlineaged human being. The ritual is often employed in the creation of magical [[Playing_the_game#Disguises|disguises]], but also sees some use as a form of entertainment - especially in [[the League]] and some parts of [[Dawn]].

With one of these masks, even a reasonably inexperienced practitioner of [[Night magic]] can perform the ritual without the assistance of a coven, provided they have mastered its intricacies. Furthermore, even a small coven equipped with several of these masks finds it relatively straightforward to enchant [[The_Twilight_Masquerade#Additional_Targets|several individuals]] at once which can prove extremely valuable if time is of the essence.

The mask also provides the bonded wearer with the ability to employ [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] in place of the expensive [[Game_items#Mana_Crystals|crystal mana]] normally required to enact the ritual magic. A ritualist wearing the Mask of the Mountebank often supplements their ritual performance by literally painting new faces onto their subject using the valuable pigments.

These talismans are often crafted as a harlequin mask, a domino mask, or as a full-face mask depicting the [[dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] [[Dramaturgy#The_Personae|persona]] of [[the Mountebank]] or (despite the common name), [[the Witch]]. Occasionally one of these magical [[:Category:Foci|foci]] may be encountered in the form of a ''Charlatan's Periapt'', a jewel which tricks the eye appearing different from varying angles; or as a ''Facedancer's Veil'' - a severe white veil that shrouds the head and shoulders of a [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[magister]]. Regardless of form, the mask often incorporates either the [[Diras|Rune of Secrets]] or the [[Xun|Rune of Transformation]].

## Rules

* Effect: Gain 2 ranks for the [[The Twilight Masquerade|Twilight Masquerade]] ritual, subject to the [[Realm_Lore#Gaining_additional_ranks|normal rules for effective skill]]. When contributing to a performance of the Twilight Masquerade ritual, you may choose to substitute [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] for crystal mana. Every 2 measures of iridescent gloaming spent counts as 1 crystal mana, up to the normal limit determined by your effective rank of night lore. 
* Materials: Crafting a Mask of the Mountebank requires three measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]], three measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and ten measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.


Oh no, there are no briars here, no siree.
