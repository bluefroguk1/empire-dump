## Description
This useful armour is most often crafted in the form of a heavy arming jacket, usually with reinforced steel jack chains on the arms. It is popular with officers and sergeants in the [[the Marches|Marches]] and the [[The League|League]]. A variant form of the Jack of Irons called the ''Bloodiron Hauberk'' is crafted in [[Wintermark]], mixing weltsilver and mithril to provide a long leather jacket that covers the arms and upper legs and is worn over mithril chain.

In the Marches it is also called a ''Jack of Chains''; both names come from a legendary giant called variously Jack-in-chains, Jack-of-Irons and Bloody Jack. Wrapped in heavy chains and wielding a terrible spiked club, the massive creature is said to be twice the size of a person and impossible to kill. According to stories the creature recovers almost immediately from even mortal wounds, and limbs hacked off continue fighting. Popular tales suggest that the demonic horror was defeated by a girl variously known as ''Clever Jill'' and ''Wise Mary'' who tricks the beast into falling down a well from which it is unable to escape. The legend insists that the giant is still buried under the earth somewhere near the modern town of [[Mitwold#Wayford|Wayford]]. 

Interestingly, some scholars believe the creature spoken of in [[Suaq]] and [[Kallavesi]] legends that they call the ''skinned king'' may be the same creature, although in the stories of [[Wintermark]] the giant beast has no skin and is ultimately defeated by a clever hunter who creates a human-shaped mannikin of fresh deer meat studded with spiked hooks, and then taunts the giant into grappling the mannikin. Trapped by the hooks, the giant cannot escape and is rolled down a steep incline into the waters of Westmere where it is assumed to have drowned.

"Why would I, Rhondira Havarri, the greatest thief in all of Sarvos, choose such a martial piece of armour? Rhondira Havarri who stole the signet ring from the Prince of Tassato! Rhondira Havarri who seduced the Bishop of Vigilance and made off with his coinbox! Rhondirra Havarri who forged the signature of the head of the civil service and proclaimed a day's holiday throughout the League! Why would I choose armour? Why, precisely so that I could pull my hand through such cruelly tight handcuffs as you have used, my friend. It mends broken bones quite splendidly quickly. Ah, you have notice that your blade is in my hands now? Yes, and the coin-purse as well, if you please. You will not be collecting the sizeable bounty on my head this day, but you're a comely lad, so Rhondira Havarri will leave you with a kiss for your troubles..."
