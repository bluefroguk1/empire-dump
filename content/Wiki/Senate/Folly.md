You've all fools and [[Briar|briar]]-brains! This is another sop to them bloody mummers in the mountains, or I'm no brewer. It's [[Folly|folly]] to pass this thing. Them that pay the piper [[Will|will]] call the tune.
Walter Brewer, [[Senator]] for [[Upwold]]
## Overview
Because of the great costs involved in creating a structure using [[Mithril|mithril]], [[Weirwood|weirwood]], or [[White granite|white granite]], most commissions are built to provide important practical benefits. A [[Folly|folly]] is the [[General|general]] term for any [[Commission|commission]] that is explicitly designed ''not'' to provide any apparent benefits.
Most follies are straightforward endeavours, statues created to celebrate some great accomplishments  of a nation, or more cynically the reputation of one of it's senators. They are ideal to create suitable monuments to memorialise those who have died in battle.
## [[Senate]] Commissions
The [[Imperial Senate]] may pass a motion of [[Commission]] for the construction of a [[Folly|folly]]. [[The Senate|The senate]] must select a [[Territory]], and a region within that territory, where the [[Folly|folly]] [[Will|will]] be constructed.
Since the construction of a [[Folly|folly]] does not provide any tangible benefits, no [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] is created to oversee it. It is possible for a [[Senator|senator]] to create a title to oversee the folly, creating a custodian for the folly.
## [[Scrutiny]]
Follies are often privately funded, the [[Senator|senator]] seeks only the permission of the Senate to create the folly, rather than direct support and funding. At times follies have faced a rough ride through the Senate, with parsimonious senators accusing political rivals of squandering precious resources that might otherwise be devoted to a [[War|war]] effort. Privately funding a motion, lets the [[Senator|senator]] cite the virtue of [[Prosperity|prosperity]] in defence of their motion. On occasions funding from the Senate has been required to complete the folly, leading to appeals to the need to showcase the [[Pride|pride]] of the nation, territory or region where the folly is sited.
Other than [[Cost|cost]], the main reason that a folly might receive close [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] is the possibility that it could be used by a non-Imperial power. Such uses can provide Imperial citizens with valuable benefits, but the Senate and [[The Synod|the Synod]] have both taken a dim view of such interference in Imperial affairs on occasion. Historically many senators have chosen to be public about the true intent of a folly, but some have preferred to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.
In theory any [[Commission|commission]] could be manipulated or taken-over by a non-Imperial power, but follies are the most susceptible because they do not have a pre-existing function or purpose.
## Benefits
### Grandeur
Upon completion of a folly, we [[Will|will]] update [[The wiki|the wiki]] entry for that region to include a description of the folly, with a length appropriate to the size and scale of the construction. The [[Senator|senator]] responsible for bringing the motion is welcome to [mailto:plot@profounddecisions.co.uk email us] with what they would like to build so that we can use that information to create [[The wiki|the wiki]] entry.
### Tangible Benefits
A folly does not provide any direct tangible benefits as a result of its construction, nor is it possible for [[The Empire|the Empire]] to adapt the folly to provide any benefits without rebuilding it.
### Potential Benefits
It is never possible for a folly to provide any tangible benefits while under Imperial control. (If it were possible, then the [[Commission|commission]] would not be a folly).
Once a folly is complete it ''may'' provide some benefits if control of the folly is ceded to a non-Imperial power. For example if the Senate approved the construction of a temple to the Asavean god of the sea, then the folly might provide some benefits if the Asaveans were given control of the folly.
In these circumstances, the non-Imperial power may appoint a being, who may or may not be an Imperial citizen, to be responsible for their operation of the folly. Such a position is not an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]], as the power of [[Appointment|appointment]] is vested in another body and cannot be directly controlled by the legal authority of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. An Imperial citizen may hold any number of foreign titles, even if they already hold an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]].
Control of a folly may be specified in the [[Senate motion]], or it may be granted by a vote, [[Judgement]] or [[Declaration]] of the relevant political house. It is possible for a non-Imperial powers to attempt to seize control of a folly without the permission or possibly knowledge of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
If [[The Empire|the Empire]] is not content with [[The Way|the way]] a non-Imperial power is employing a folly, then it may pass an appropriately worded [[Senate motion]] to instruct the [[Magistrates|magistrates]] to eject them. If passed, this motion [[Will|will]] restore the folly to its original inert state. If the Senate chooses, they may order the destruction of any [[Commission|commission]] that is in a region controlled by [[The Empire|the Empire]]. The costs to destroy a commission are dependent on the size and scale of the construction.
## Costs
* Time: 3 months to construct per 50 wains of [[Materials|materials]] used
* Labour: 3 crowns per wain
* Upkeep: None
A folly requires at least one wain of either [[White granite|white granite]], [[Weirwood|weirwood]] or [[Mithril|mithril]]. There is no upper limit on the number of wains that may be used to construct a folly, the more material expended, the more impressive the resulting folly [[Will|will]] be.
Most follies do not have any noticeable upkeep. However it is possible for a folly to be damaged, usually by saboteurs or attacking forces, in which case it may require further [[Bourse|bourse]] [[Materials|materials]] or money to restore its grandeur or prevent its complete collapse.

## Game Design
Follies exist so that players can create a proper memorial to the dead, or create similar structures that celebrate national [[Pride|pride]] or other achievements. You cannot build a folly and then have the folly provide some direct tangible benefit - by definition that is not a folly. Anything that provides a benefit while under Imperial control is a [[Sinecure]], [[Ministry]], or similar and must follow those rules in their entirety.
If a player has made an arrangement with a non-Imperial power that they can build a folly that will provide direct benefits if control is granted to or usurped by that power. It is an exceptionally bad idea to build a folly in the vain hope that it will naturally appeal to another power to take it over - that is a recipe for disappointment. Any character seeking to go down this path is strongly advised to make their agreements with the foreign power ''before'' embarking on the construction of a folly.
