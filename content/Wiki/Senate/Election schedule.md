## Overview
Most significant Imperial Titles are reelected annually on a specific date, for instance an election for the title of [[Senator]] of [[Madruga]] is held every summit at the Winter Solstice. If the title dies, is revoked or steps down then the title becomes vacant; it is re-elected at the Earliest practical [[Opportunity]] but an election for the title still takes place at the normal date.
Some Imperial titles appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] serve for a year from the summit where they were appointed. Such a title becomes eligible for reAppointment at anytime during the summit one year later. The incumbent remains in position until replaced or at the end of the event - whichever comes sooner.  If the Senate wish, they can choose to elect a title to serve for less than a year. This must be explicit in the wording of the [[Senate motion]].  It is not possible to extend the term beyond a year, nor to make it shorter than a single season, nor to restrict the length served of a tenured position.  
The majority of titles appointed by the [[Imperial Conclave]] can be reelected at any time through a [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. 
Some Imperial titles have tenure. The title is held until the citizen dies or steps down. 
The schedule below shows the earliest summit at which each [[Imperial Title]] will become eligible for reelection. A title may become eligible at any point before this if the title holder dies, steps down or is revoked.
