Title: Shipyard
---
## Overview
A [[Shipyard|shipyard]] is a significant undertaking, creating a facility specifically designed for the creation and support of [[Imperial navy|naval vessels]]. 
## Senate Commissions
The [[Imperial Senate]] may pass a motion for the construction of a [[Shipyard|shipyard]]. The senate must select a [[Territory]], and a region within that territory that possesses the ''coastal'' quality, where the [[Shipyard|shipyard]] will be constructed.
Since there is no active governance of a shipyard, there is no Imperial title associated with the [[Commission|commission]].
## Benefits
### Naval Construction
The [[Imperial Senate]] can use a shipyard to [[Commission]] the construction of an [[Imperial navy]]. A single shipyard can work on only one Imperial navy at a time, and can build a navy for any Imperial nation regardless of which nation controls the territory where the shipyard has been built.
### Refuge
An Imperial navy may take refuge in a friendly shipyard using the [[Navy orders#Put to Port|put to port]] order. This is a special order which causes the navy to withdraw into the shipyard. In addition to being protected from naval attacks, the navy will recover additional fighting strength each season.
Although the navy cannot be attacked directly, the region containing the shipyard may be vulnerable to attack by opposing forces. If the region is captured then the shipyard will fall into enemy hands and any navy taking refuge there would need to be scuttled to prevent it being seized. The Grendel are known to build fortifications next to their shipyards, fortifying the ports and building powerful coastal defences, to prevent this.
### Costs
* Materials: 30 wains of [[Weirwood]], 20 wains of [[White granite]], and 150 crowns
* Time: 3 months
* Upkeep: 5 thrones
## Limitations
A shipyard can only be constructed in a region that has the coastal keyword.
