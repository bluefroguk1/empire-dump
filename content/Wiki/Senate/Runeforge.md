## Overview
A [[Runeforge|runeforge]] allows [[The Empire|the Empire]] to create new [[Magic Items]]. Creating a new [[Magic|magic]] item is normally a process that can take generations of refinement and experimentation - combining the magical [[Materials]] in the right way and the right proportions is an art, not a science. A [[Runeforge|runeforge]] greatly speeds up this process, focusing the [[Skills|skills]] of dozens of master artisans into experimentation and research, and providing both extensive [[Materials|materials]] and expensive books or examples of existing [[Magic Items|magic items]] with which they can work.
A [[Runeforge|runeforge]] is an expensive proposition, and once complete is likely to cover an extensive area. In addition to the work areas, the [[Runeforge|runeforge]] [[Will|will]] incorporate apartments for the artisans and their assistants, as well as the infrastructure needed to support them. It is also likely to include warehouses for supplies and stores, and more than likely at least one library where books and scrolls can be referenced. A place to preserve and display failed, depleted or partially-successful [[Magic|magic]] items [[Will|will]] also prove useful.
Despite being called a "forge" it is equally possible to create any type of [[Magic|magic]] item here. A skilled tailor from a Dawnish [[Weaver cabal]] [[Will|will]] rub shoulders with a gruff Marcher smith, while an [[Urizen]] weaponsmith argues the finer points of the use of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] with a [[League]] mask-maker.
## [[Senate]] Commissions
The [[Imperial Senate]] may pass a motion for the construction of a [[Runeforge|runeforge]].[[The Senate]] must select a [[Territory]] and region where the runeforge is to be built. 
When the construction is complete a new [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] is automatically created. The title may be either an Imperial or National position. The [[Senate motion]] should state what the title is called, and how it [[Will|will]] be appointed. The most likely path is for an Imperial or National position to be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]], or through the [[Imperial Bourse]].
In the opinion of the Constitutional Court, the power to appoint the title could not be given to the [[Imperial Conclave]], unless that body was altered to allow the full participation of artisans. Such a change would be complex and difficult, not least because artisans cannot reach the [[Hall of Worlds]], and would certainly require the authority of [[The Throne]] to ratify.
### Benefits
### Unique Crafting
The runeforge can be used to create a single copy of a unique [[Magic|magic]] item. It takes six months to research a new item, which can require up to 40 [[Materials|materials]] to create. If the finished item requires more than 40 [[Materials|materials]], it requires one extra season of work for every 20 extra [[Materials|materials]]. When the research is completed, the master of the forge is presented with a standard [[Magic|magic]] item that, as with all such items, [[Will|will]] last for one year. 
At this time, the master of the forge may choose to learn the ability to make that item for the usual experience point costs. However, the character will be unable to teach anyone else how to make the item - the ability to do so will remain theirs alone.
### Forge Schema
Instead of constructing a single copy of a magic item, the master of the forge may choose to make a schema. It takes six months to research a schema, which can require up to 40 materials to create. If the finished item requires more than 40 materials, it requires one extra season of work for every 20 extra materials. 
Creating a schema requires ten rings of [[Ilium]], regardless of how many materials are needed to create the item. A schema is permanent unless destroyed with [[Words of Ending]].
A schema is a "pattern" for the new crafted item that anyone can use to learn the method of creating the item. It can also be expended with the [[Assistance|assistance]] of the [[Imperial Senate]] to spread the knowledge of how to make the new item throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]].
Unique items
A unique item is one that does not already exist in the magic item lists. It is likely that such an item will need to be bonded, and will be a weapon, armour, talisman or group magic item. [[Magic Items|Magic items]] tend to do one thing, rather than multiple types of things, and creating an item that does more than one thing is increasingly more expensive that creating an item that does one thing well. Not every ability of a magic item is equally appropriate to every kind of item, and more powerful items may prove to be prohibitively expensive in terms of time or materials required - or flat out impossible. It is [[Worth|worth]] talking to Profound Decisions about the kind of item you wish to create so that we can work together to come up with something possible that is as close as we can get to your original idea.
### Costs
* Materials: 60 wains of [[Mithril]], 60 wains of [[Weirwood]], 60 wains of [[White granite]], and 540 crowns
* Time: 1 year
* Upkeep: Variable (see below)
The upkeep on the first runeforge would be 5 thrones, the second 10 thrones and the third 25 thrones. There are a limited number of artisans in [[The Empire|the Empire]] who are prepared to help with creating new items. This means that each new runeforge that is constructed will have an increasing upkeep [[Cost|cost]] - to reflect the fact that it must pay more to entice those independent artisans that remain to work there, and that it is competing for raw materials with the other runeforges.

* There are the ruins of an ancient runeforge under Gildenheim in [[Skarsind]] but they are non-functional.
## OOC Note
The runeforge is used during [[Downtime|downtime]]. The player who controls the runeforge should [[Contact Profound Decisions|contact Profound Decisions]] by e-mail (at empire.rules@profounddecisions.co.uk) prior to the next event with the details of the item they wish to try and create. If they want to make a schema, they will need the appropriate number of rings of [[Ilium|ilium]] in their inventory. Profound Decisions will let the player know before the next event the number and type of materials required to make the new item.
