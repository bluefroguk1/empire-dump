## Overview

The [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] has the right to announce a single [[Commission]]. There are currently two of these titles, all auctioned through the [[Imperial Bourse]]. Although the bearer is not a member of the [[Imperial Senate]], they may use a single [[Senate announcement]] to instruct [[The Empire|the Empire]] to approve a [[Commission|commission]] ''provided that they do so at the summit that the title was appointed.''
The titles were created at the [[Winter]] Solstice summit of 380YE. The titles were used to replace the existing civilian commissioners who were expected to approve and oversee the Commission of sinecures, ministries, and great works in their nation.
In [[Summer]] 382YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to reallocate one of the Imperial Wayleaves as an [[Imperial Orcs]] national position creating the [[Imperial Orc Wayleave]].  This reduced the number of Imperial Wayleaves from three to two. They further amended the powers of the Imperial Orc Wayleave during the Winter Solstice 383YE, leading to the Constitutional Court to request that the name of the title be changed to reflect the fact it was no longer a wayleave - it is now called [[Legion Engineer]]. 
==Responsibilities== 
The [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] has no responsibilities and may use the authority granted by the title to order any commission they choose. These titles replaced the previous system where each nation would appoint a [[Civilian Commissioner]], and carry ''some'' of the restrictions and limitations imposed those titles.
## Powers
### Commission
Once during the summit where the title is appointed, each bearer can Commission the construction of a [[Sinecure]], [[Ministry]], or [[Great work]]. The [[Materials|materials]] and money required for construction must be provided by the bearer or their agents.
If the bearer announces the commission of a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] or [[Ministry|ministry]] then an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the commission is automatically created. The location and size of the commission and the method of [[Appointment|appointment]] and [[Tenure|tenure]] of any associated title are all part of the necessary details and may be included in the announcement made by the bearer or determined later by them.
A bearer of an Imperial Wayleave cannot alter an existing commission.
### Announcement
To use their power of commission, the bearer must make an announcement in the Imperial [[Senate]]. No voting is possible by [[The Senate|the Senate]] at this point, as the power had been delegated to the bearer.
The [[Imperial Synod]] may choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the bearer's announcement; there is no refund of the money provided to purchase the title if the commission is vetoed.
## Limitations
The bearer of an Imperial wayleave can only commission a sinecure, ministry, or [[Great work|great work]].
Unlike a [[Civilian Commissioner]], the bearer is not prohibited from using their power to commission anything that provides [[Liao|liao]] or votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. However the [[Appointment|appointment]] of such a title is still subject to the normal constitutional restrictions.
They are not required to build their commission in their own nation and may use any method of appointment (for example, through [[The Bourse|the Bourse]], [[The Conclave|the Conclave]], [[Military Council]], or [[Synod]]). The civil service are on hand to offer legal advice or support to a bearer just as they are to a [[Senator|senator]], and the bearer may wish to submit their commission for [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] before it is announced to ensure there are no problems with their design.
## Appointment
Each title of bearer of an Imperial wayleave is determined by auction by the [[Imperial Bourse]]. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title. 
The bearer retains the title ''for a single season only'' - they must use the power of commission at the summit where they gain the title, otherwise it is lost. As an Imperial [[Bourse]] title, the position cannot be revoked by the Imperial Synod.
