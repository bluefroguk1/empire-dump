This page refers to an obsolete Imperial Title; the civilian commissioners were [[Abrogate Civilian Commissioners|abrogated]] by the Senate during the Winter 380YE summit.
## Overview
Each nation of the Empire appointed a [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] to oversee construction of [[Sinecure|sinecures]], [[Ministry|ministries]], and [[Great work|great works]] in that nation. The commissioner was usually selected by the [[Senator|senators]] of their nation but in rare circumstances it was possible for them to be [[Appointments by the Senate|elected by the Imperial Senate]]. Although the commissioner was not a member of the Senate, they had powers comparable to or greater than those of a senator - and any constructions they intended to [[Commission]] were [[Senate announcement|announced]] in the Senate.
The title was [[Create titles of Civilian Commissioners|created]] at the Winter Solstice summit of 379YE. It was [[Abrogate Civilian Commissioners|abrogated]] during the Winter Solstice 380YE, a year later.
==Responsibilities== 
The Commissioners were responsible for the prosperity of the Empire. They were expected to approve and oversee the [[Commission]] of sinecures, ministries, and great works in their nation.
## Powers
### [[Commission]]
Once during each summit, each commissioner could [[Commission]] the construction of a [[Sinecure]], [[Ministry]], or [[Great work]] in their nation. The materials and money required for construction were provided by the commissioner.  A [[Sinecure]] or [[Ministry]] automatically created an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the [[Commission|commission]]. The new title was a national [[Appointment by the Senate|appointment by the Senate]]. They could only approve a [[Commission|commission]] in their one of [[Territory|territories]] that is part of their nation. Control of a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] or [[Ministry|ministry]] is a lifetime title, unless it is revoked by the General Assembly, the Council of Nine or the appropriate national Assembly.
Prior to Spring 380YE, this power was unlimited. An administrative motion [[Amend powers of the Civilian Commissioners|amended]] the power to be usable once each season.
### Announcement
To use their power of commission, the commissioner needed to provide an [[Senate announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who presented the decision to the Senate. No voting was possible by the Senate at this point, as the power had been delegated to the commissioner. The [[Imperial Synod]] could, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the commissioner's decision.
## Limitations
A [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] could commission anything that requires an ''upkeep''.
A [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] could not commission anything that provided votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. Having such sinecures be assigned by the Senators of a nation would be unconstitutional. This meant that was not normally possible to commission a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] that produces [[Liao]] (as sinecures that produce liao also provide votes in the Synod), without an [[Opportunity]] that specifically permits such a thing.
## Selection
The commissioner was a [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|national position appointed by the Senate]]. Under normal circumstances it was appointed by unanimous vote of the senators of that nation.
Only a citizen of the appropriate nation could be appointed as the commissioner from that nation.
## Removal
A commissioner served until the next election for the title. They could be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[The Assemblies of the Synod|General Assembly]], the [[The Assemblies of the Synod#The Assembly of Nine|Assembly of the Nine]] and by the appropriate [[The Assemblies of the Synod#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]] of the [[Imperial Synod]].
## History
In Spring 380YE, the Senate appointed the following people as Civilian Commissioners
* The Civilian Commissioner of The Brass Coast - Carlos I Guerra
* The Civilian Commissioner of Dawn - Morien Stewart
* The Civilian Commissioner of The Marches- Henry Ward
* The Civilian Commissioner of The Imperial Orcs - Bloodcrow Yargol
* The Civilian Commissioner of The League - Lorenzo of the Butchers
* The Civilian Commissioner of Navarr - Bron Foxden
* The Civilian Commissioner of Varushka - Nadya Gremani
* The Civilian Commissioner of Highguard - Rhesa of the Scions of Ravensfell
* The Civilian Commissioners for Wintermark and Urizen were left vacant.
At the same time, the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to restrict the powers of the civilian commissioners.
During Autumn 380YE Henry Ward resigned his post as the Civilian Commissioner of The Marches as he had just become a [[Senator]].
After a year, in Winter 380YE, the Senate abrogated the motion that created the titles, meaning that they ceased to exist.
