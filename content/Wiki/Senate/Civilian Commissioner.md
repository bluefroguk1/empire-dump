This page refers to an obsolete [[Imperial Title]]; the civilian commissioners were abrogated by [[The Senate|the Senate]] during the [[Winter]] 380YE summit.
## Overview
Each nation of [[The Empire|the Empire]] appointed a [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] to oversee construction of sinecures, ministries, and great works in that nation. The commissioner was usually selected by the senators of their nation but in rare circumstances it was possible for them to be elected by the [[Imperial Senate]]. Although the commissioner was not a member of the [[Senate]], they had powers comparable to or greater than those of a [[Senator|senator]] - and any constructions they intended to [[Commission]] were announced in the Senate.
The title was created at the Winter Solstice summit of 379YE. It was abrogated during the Winter Solstice 380YE, a year later.
==Responsibilities== 
The Commissioners were responsible for the [[Prosperity|prosperity]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. They were expected to approve and oversee the [[Commission]] of sinecures, ministries, and great works in their nation.
## Powers
### [[Commission]]
Once during each summit, each commissioner could [[Commission]] the construction of a [[Sinecure]], [[Ministry]], or [[Great work]] in their nation. The [[Materials|materials]] and money required for construction were provided by the commissioner.  A [[Sinecure]] or [[Ministry]] automatically created an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the [[Commission|commission]]. The new title was a national [[Appointment by the Senate|appointment by the Senate]]. They could only approve a commission in their one of territories that is part of their nation. Control of a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] or [[Ministry|ministry]] is a lifetime title, unless it is revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Council of Nine or the appropriate [[National Assembly|national Assembly]].
Prior to [[Spring]] 380YE, this power was unlimited. An [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]] amended the power to be usable once each season.
### Announcement
To use their power of commission, the commissioner needed to provide an announcement to the Civil Service, who presented the decision to the Senate. No voting was possible by the Senate at this point, as the power had been delegated to the commissioner. The [[Imperial Synod]] could, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the commissioner's decision.
## Limitations
A [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] could commission anything that requires an ''upkeep''.
A [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] could not commission anything that provided votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. Having such sinecures be assigned by the Senators of a nation would be unconstitutional. This meant that was not normally possible to commission a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] that produces [[Liao]] (as sinecures that produce [[Liao|liao]] also provide votes in [[The Synod|the Synod]]), without an [[Opportunity]] that specifically permits such a thing.
## Selection
The commissioner was a national position appointed by the Senate. Under normal circumstances it was appointed by unanimous vote of the senators of that nation.
Only a citizen of the appropriate nation could be appointed as the commissioner from that nation.
## Removal
A commissioner served until the next election for the title. They could be revoked by the [[General Assembly]], the [[Assembly of the Nine]] and by the appropriate National [[Assembly]] of the Imperial [[Synod]].
## [[History]]
In Spring 380YE, the Senate appointed the following people as Civilian Commissioners
* The [[Civilian Commissioner]] of [[The Brass Coast]] - Carlos I [[Guerra]]
* The [[Civilian Commissioner]] of [[Dawn]] - Morien Stewart
* The Civilian Commissioner of [[The Marches]]- Henry Ward
* The Civilian Commissioner of The [[Imperial Orcs]] - Bloodcrow Yargol
* The Civilian Commissioner of [[The League]] - Lorenzo of the Butchers
* The Civilian Commissioner of [[Navarr]] - Bron Foxden
* The Civilian Commissioner of [[Varushka]] - Nadya Gremani
* The Civilian Commissioner of [[Highguard]] - Rhesa of the Scions of Ravensfell
* The Civilian Commissioners for [[Wintermark]] and [[Urizen]] were left vacant.
At the same time, the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to restrict the powers of the civilian commissioners.
During [[Autumn]] 380YE Henry Ward resigned his post as the Civilian Commissioner of [[The Marches]] as he had just become a [[Senator]].
After a year, in Winter 380YE, the Senate abrogated the motion that created the titles, meaning that they ceased to exist.
