### Overview
A [[Sinecure|sinecure]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that provides the office holder with a fixed income, usually in the form of the production from a [[Commission]]. The return can take many different forms, the most common being money, [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Materials|materials]] for crafting items, mana crystals, and [[Liao|liao]] and votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. Sinecures are often created with [[Tenure]], meaning they are generally retained until the holder dies, resigns, or is removed by [[The Synod|the Synod]].
There are several well worn paths for appointing a [[Sinecure|sinecure]]; the most common are by unanimous decisions of a nations senators, a [[Judgement]] of [[Appointment]] in one of the assemblies of the [[Imperial Synod]], or the [[Tally of the Votes]] in the [[Imperial Bourse]].
### Production
The resources a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] provides are added to a character's inventory automatically when [[Downtime]] closes. The income is received only by the person with the title - if the title has not been appointed the resources do not accrue. As long as the title is held by someone, the resources are received regardless of whether they attend the summit at [[Anvil]] or not.
## [[Senate]] Commissions
The [[Imperial Senate]] may pass a motion for the construction of an establishment capable of producing wealth - money, herbs, resources or similar. This motion automatically results in the creation of a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] once the construction is complete.
It is also possible for [[The Senate|the Senate]] to pass a motion to upgrade a [[Sinecure|sinecure]], increasing the benefits that it provides.
### Costs
* [[Materials]]: Variable (minimum 10 wains)
* Time: 3 months to construct per 50 wains of [[Materials|materials]] used
* Labour: 3 crowns per wain
* Upkeep: None
The more resources are devoted to constructing a sinecure, the greater the return. Under normal circumstances, the material required [[Will|will]] be the one associated with upgrading an equivalent personal [[Resource|resource]]. For example, at least 10 wains of [[Mithril|mithril]] is required to create a sinecure that produces mana crystals.
In addition to the wains required, it costs 3 crowns per wain to pay for labour and [[Skills|skills]] to complete the construction.

The table shows some standard costs and benefits for a range of sinecures. For example a sinecure created by the Senate using 20 wains of [[Mithril|mithril]] could produce 13 mana crystals each season. There is no upper limit on how many wains can be used to construct a sinecure; provided at least 10 wains are used, then any amount can be spent to build it.
## Limitations
It is not possible to create a sinecure which mimics the effects of a [[Fleet]] or [[Military unit]], nor is it possible to create a sinecure which creates [[Mithril|mithril]], [[Ilium]], [[Weirwood|weirwood]], or [[White granite|white granite]].
A sinecure is very similar to a personal resource such as a [[Farm|farm]] or [[Mine|mine]] in that it provides a set amount of resources to the character who holds the position at the start of each event. Unlike a personal resource, however, you don't need to attend the previous event to get the benefits. Also, the sinecure cannot be upgraded or diversified by its holder (only by [[Senate motion|senate motion]]) and there are no decisions to be made about what the position provides or how it does so. A sinecure that produces liao [[Will|will]] not come with an option to sell that liao in [[Downtime|downtime]], a sinecure that produces [[Green iron|green iron]] cannot be paid to produce more in [[The Way|the way]] a green iron [[Mine|mine]] could.
Sinecures are not affected by [[Rituals|rituals]] that target a personal resource. A [[Ritual|ritual]] that increases the production of a green iron [[Mine|mine]] [[Will|will]] not affect a sinecure that produces green iron.
A sinecure that produces herbs [[Will|will]] normally produce equal quantities of all herbs. It is possible to create a sinecure that produces a single [[Herb|herb]], provided it is one that is commonly found in the area. As part of the necessary details, the [[Senator|senator]] can indicate what herbs they would like but the final decision about production is made by [[The game|the game]] team.
## [[Synod]] Votes
Any sinecure that produces liao also provides votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. The flavour for such a sinecure almost invariably includes a group of faithful lay followers of [[The Way|the Way]] of some sort. The civil service evaluates this in the same way they would a [[Congregation]] and assigns liao and votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] on that basis.
A sinecure that provide votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] has significant constitutional implications if the [[Appointment|appointment]] of the sinecure is not made through the Synod. For example, the [[Guardian]] of Britta's Shrine was unconstitutional since it was appointed by the Senate but the title carried votes in the Synod. The [[Magistrates|magistrates]] would not have allowed this motion to pass in this form if they had noticed the situation at the time. If the sinecure were appointed by the Synod, then it would be constitutional.
A sinecure that provides votes in the Imperial Synod grants the holder of that title the legal powers and responsibilities of membership of the Synod. If the holder of the title is not already a [[Member of the Synod|member of the Synod]], it automatically includes membership of all appropriate assemblies (the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the appropriate [[National Assembly]], and either the relevant [[Virtue assembly|Virtue Assembly]] or the [[Assembly]] of [[The Way|the Way]]).
The physical location of a sinecure that provides synod votes is not relevant to the assemblies that the owner is considered to belong to. A [[Navarr]] [[Guide|guide]] who maintains a cathedral in [[The Marches|the Marches]] still wields their votes in the [[Navarr]] national [[Assembly|assembly]] rather than the Marcher national [[Assembly|assembly]], even though the [[Congregation|congregation]] of that cathedral are largely of Marcher [[Nationality|nationality]]. Only the size of the [[Congregation|congregation]] matters to the civil service, not its make-up.
A sinecure that provides votes in the Imperial Synod does not provide additional votes during the election of a Highborn [[Senator|senator]]. This could in theory lead to the odd situation where a Highborn citizen can vote in that election due to the possession of a sinecure, but has no votes. On the rare occasions that this has come up, the citizen can attend and participate in the interrogation of the candidates, but cannot cast any votes during the selection process.
## Other Votes
It is no longer possible to create a sinecure that provides votes in a [[Bourse]] or Senate election, even where voting is determined by the size of a citizen's personal resource. After lengthy consideration, the Constitutional Court determined that sinecures that did this violated an important [[Principle of Presence|principle of presence]], that an individual should be present to cast their vote.
## Responsibility
Any citizen who is granted a sinecure is expected to be responsible for any problems that might beset the resources represented by the sinecure. For example, if [[Thule]] reavers are raiding the mines overseen by the Lady of the Upper Halls, then [[The Empire|the Empire]] [[Will|will]] expect that citizen to deal with the problem.
