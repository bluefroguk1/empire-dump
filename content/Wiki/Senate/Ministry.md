Title: Ministry
---
## Overview
A [[Ministry|ministry]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that empowers the holder to purchase one or more valuable resources. The [[Imperial Senate]] can create ministries that allow the title holder to exchange money for herbs, liao, mana crystals or materials such as green iron or weltsilver.
Many ministries have been appointed over the years with specific goals or the support of specific structures in mind. A [[Ministry|ministry]] differs from a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] in a number of ways, but the most obvious is that the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] provides a specific income of set materials, while a [[Ministry|ministry]] is potentially able to purchase large amounts of material as their needs and opportunities dictate.
Ministries may be appointed for life or re-elected annually.
## Downtime
Each downtime, a character who controls a ministry will have the option to spend money from their inventory to buy the materials the ministry provides. Each minister has a specific set of options as to what they may purchase and at what price. Ministers spend their money and make their choices during downtime from their character page. Resources purchased are placed in the inventory when the downtime is processed. The specific choices the character can make depend on the nature of the ministerial position and the number of wains spent setting the position up.
You can always use a ministry, even if you weren't able to attend the last event.
For example, a minister who is appointed to operate a vast Mana market in Morrow might have the choice of whether to buy 21 mana crystals for 18 crowns; 42 mana crystals for 36 crowns; or 63 mana crystals for 54 crowns. They could not spend 9 crowns to buy 7 mana crystals.
## Senate Commissions
The [[Imperial Senate]] may pass a motion for the construction of an establishment that allows the purchase of herbs, resources or similar. This motion automatically results in the creation of a ministry once the construction is complete.
It is also possible for the Senate to pass a motion to upgrade a ministry, increasing the benefits that it provides.
### Costs
* Materials: Variable (minimum 12 wains)
* Time: 3 months to construct per 50 wains of materials used
* Labour: 3 crowns per wain
* Upkeep: None
The more resources are devoted to constructing a ministry, the more resources can be purchased each downtime. Under normal circumstances, the material required will be the one associated with upgrading an equivalent personal resource. For example, at least 12 wains of mithril is required to create a ministry that allows the purchase of mana crystals.
In addition to the wains required, it costs 3 crowns per wain to pay for labour and skills to complete the construction.

The tables shows some standard purchase costs for a range of different sized ministries. For example a ministry created by the Senate using 16 wains of mithril could allow the purchase of 8, 16, 25, or 33 mana crystals each season. There is no upper limit on how many wains can be used to construct a ministry; provided at least 12 wains are used, then any amount can be spent to build it.
## Limitations
It is not possible to create a ministry which allows the purchase of [[Ilium]], [[Liao]], [[Mithril]], [[Weirwood]], or [[White granite]] without a suitable [[Opportunity]].
Although a ministry produces items like a personal resource, it cannot be upgraded or diversified in the same way a personal resource can. The only options available are what materials to buy. A ministry that produces liao will not come with an option to sell that liao in downtime, a ministry that produces green iron cannot be paid to produce more in the way a green iron mine could.
Ministries are not affected by rituals that target a personal resource. A ritual that increases the production of a green iron mine will not affect a ministry that produces green iron.
## Responsibility
Any citizen who is granted a ministry is expected to be responsible for any problems that might beset the resources represented by the ministry. For example, if bandit raiders are threatening the mines overseen by the [[Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills]], then the Empire will expect that citizen to deal with the problem.
