Tune by Dave Lowry, lyrics by Dave Lowry and Claire Sheridan.

A meditation on the key concepts underpinning the Urizen.

The Three Pillars
''Ioseph & Nicassia of Phoenix Reach''

We shape and we perceive,
We hide and grow.
The Realms move and concede;
We move the flow.
A word can break a wall,
A rune a soul:
We'll know and name them all,
Make this world whole.

Chorus:
These three pillars hold our nation,
Stronger than mountains, clearer than a stream,
Virtue carried to our horizon,
These three pillars.

We document and own,
We learn and grow:
All knowledge can be known;
It's ours to know.
We reason and apply,
We use with care,
Our Spires touch the sky,
Destinyâ€™s there.

(Chorus)

So ever on we strive,
Ambitions grow.
Through Poise we show our Pride
In what we know.
Our work will strengthen all;
We'll pass it on.
Others will heed the call
After we've gone.

(Chorus)
