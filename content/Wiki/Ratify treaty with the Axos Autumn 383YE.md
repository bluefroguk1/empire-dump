__NOTOC__
To cooperate with Axos in the following ways: 

1. To Provide maps of the Mountains of the Moon. 

2. Allow them to use the Sarangrave spy network. 

3. Invite Axou military captains to defend the Eastern Brokerage in Therunin and extend the territoriesâ€™ offer of payment to them. 

4. Formally invite the people of Maykop to allow select students at the College to apply for places studying at the great centres of learning in the Empire. 

5. Permit the ambassador to purchase land at the Quayside in Issyk in Axos. 

These points are combined into one Treaty, to save senate time and motions;

* Passed
## Date
* Autumn 383YE
## Cost
* Unknown
## Progress
* None
## Campaign Outcome
The [[Rise_of_Terunael#Therunin|additional rewards offered]] to soldiers prepared to defend Therunin are being offered by private Imperial citizens, not by the Senate. As such this treaty has no power to extend that payment to the Axou; it will be up to the Navarr citizens of Therunin whether they choose to provide these rewards to Axou soldiers. It is unconstitutional for the Senate to demand that Imperial citizens use their wealth in a mandated fashion.

## Constitution
With regards to the section "These points are combined into one Treaty, to save senate time and motions", it is not possible to combine points together to save the senate time and motions. It is either a [[Ambassador#Treaty|treaty]] agreed with a foreign power as defined in the powers of the [[ambassador]], or it is not a treaty.
