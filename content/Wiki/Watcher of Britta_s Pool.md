## Overview
The Watcher of Britta's Pool was an Imperial title [[Construct_shrine_to_Britta|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 379YE. The position of Watcher is a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but awarded a regular income of liao and votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] to reflect the many pilgrims making the visit to the pool.

Following the death of [[Empress Britta]] in 376YE, heroic efforts recovered her body and many of her effects from the [[Thule]] barbarians. The body was interred in the swamps of [[Kallavesa]] while her personal accouterments were placed in a [[Necropolis#The Shrine of Britta|shrine of white granite]] in [[Necropolis]]. In Autumn 379YE, a delegation of Highborn and [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]] visited the shrine and removed the personal effects of the Young Empress and reunite them with her body in the swamps. The Pool was created to support the many pilgrims from Wintermark and beyond to allow them to visit Britta's resting place in safety.
## Responsibilities
The Watcher oversees the pool dedicated to the memory of the dead Empress, and ensures the grove is not disturbed.
## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides nine measures of [[liao]] to the Watcher each season, to be used as they see fit.
### Voice in the Synod
The Watcher of Britta's Pool may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 18 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 18 votes if they already have a [[congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly they are eligible for.
## Appointment
The Watcher of Britta's Tomb is chosen by a [[judgement]] of [[appointment]] in the [[Wintermark]] [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|national assembly]]. 

The title may only be held by a Wintermark citizen. The Watcher of Britta's Pool has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wintermark National Assembly, and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
