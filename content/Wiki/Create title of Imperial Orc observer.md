* Passed Winter 376YE (Easter 2013).

### Election
* Senate election

The Advisor is selected by the [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial orc]] nation. The generals will appoint it, and if they are not unanimous the decision falls to the Senate in the same manner they would select a General (all candidates put themselves forward). This may be seen as setting a precedent for the senator selection process when the Imperial Orcs claim their first territory.

The Advisor on Orc Affairs has the ability to [[Imperial Senate#Speaking|speak]] in the Senate.

The Advisor has the right to address the Senate. They may require the Speakers to timetable an address to the Senate each season as they see fit.

The Advisor cannot be removed from the Senate except by [[The Throne]] or by the Speakers.

The Advisor can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the Imperial Orc assembly, the General Assembly or the Council of Nine.
