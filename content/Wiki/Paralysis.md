## Description
This potent martial magic renders an enemy defenceless for a short period of time - usually more than enough time to either dispatch or capture them. Like the [[repel]] spell, it employs magical force; in this case to restrain the target's entire body. This is sometimes described as akin to being held by a massive, invisible hand or being wrapped from head to foot in loose bands of unseen power that tighten instantly to prevent any movement. Some targets, however, have described the experience more as a metaphorical force - a dominating power that makes it impossible for them to even think about moving their bodies for a short time.

When the spell takes hold it is a rare enemy who has the ability to survive the follow-up attacks of the magician and their allies.

Any [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] who plans to take the battlefield can supplement their magical abilities with a [[Quiet Word]] [[Weapons & armour#Rods|rod]], while more dedicated [[Magical skills#Battle Mage|war wizards]] can appreciate the value of a [[Shadowbound Donjon]] [[Weapons & armour#Staff|staff]]. The [[Caress of Arhallogen]] is a powerful staff that allows multiple additional uses of this spell each day, as well as granting abilities to wield supernatural [[venom]] against enemies, although its connection to the [[eternal]] [[Arhallogen]] has given it something of a dark reputation.

Of particular interest to a magician who masters this devastating spell is the [[Sceptre of the Necropolis]], a powerful rod that gives the wielder a limited ability to use their spell to [[Calls#IMPALE|critically injure]] their target by stilling processes vital to life rather than immobilising their bodies.
## Casting

## Effects
You may call [[Calls#PARALYSE|PARALYSE]] against the target struck by your [[Weapons & armour#Implements|implement]].

Paralysis holds the target in place with magical force for ten seconds. They can talk or drink a potion if they are fed one, but they cannot move or take any other actions. 

If the target blocks or parries your strike they are not paralysed.

## Sample Spellcasting Vocals
* (''Slashing an implement in a swift arc'') "Feel the weight of the mountain - PARALYSE!"
* "I command you with Hirmok's control, be still - PARALYSE!"
* "The light of Ophis stun you with its brilliance - PARALYSE!"
* "Be bound as the Chained Man - PARALYSE!"
* "In the Spider-King's name, I bind you with magic - PARALYSE!"

## Common Elements
* Rune Magic: The rune [[Hirmok]], which signifies control and domination, is strongly connected with this spell, although some magicians favour [[Kyrop]], the rune of weakness. In both cases, a magician might sketch the rune in the air with their implement just prior to striking with it.
* Astronomancy: An [[astronomancy|astronomancer]] might evoke the power of [[the Mountain]] with this spell - its resonance can be used to impart immobility to a victim as easily as it can be evoked to grant strength and endurance. The constellation of [[the Lock]] can be evoked in a similar way - the paralysis spell binds the target, or "wards" them against movement. The [[Astronomancy#Tulpas#tulpa|tulpa]] of the Chained Man is sometimes referenced with this spell. 
* Dramaturgy: A [[dramaturgy|dramaturgist]] might take on the commanding mien of [[the Bishop]] or [[the Prince]] and instruct the target to remain where they are. less commonly, [[the Doctor]] might be employed to remove the facility of movement from an opponent "for their own good", or by using that [[Dramaturgy#The Personae|role's]] superior knowledge of anatomy to restrict movement. The [[Dramaturgy#The Thrones|throne]] of [[the Tomb]] is also a common reference, especially when drawing a connection between the immobility created by magic and the immobility of the dead body bound within a grave.
* Other traditions: A [[Dawn|Dawnish]] witch might echo the terrifying roar of the [[Legendary_beasts#Chimera|chimera]] when casting this spell. Some magicians also like to call on the power of an eternal such as [[Arhallogen]] or [[Kimus]] when striking with this spell.
* Realms: The ability to immobilise someone with magical force resonates strongly with the realm of Day. Some magicians point to the powerlessness this spell creates as showing clear sympathy with the realm of Winter. A few magicians shrug and point to Arhallogen and similar poisonous creatures and calmly claim that this spell is a manifestation of the power of Spring.
