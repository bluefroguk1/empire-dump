Come, my pretty one, and dance with me,
All in your red dress, trimmed with ribbons,
There’s a whole wide world out there for you to see,
But the days are short, and few in number,
So dance,  dance,  dance,  dance,
dance,  dance,  dance,  dance,
dance,  dance,  dance,  dance,
My pretty one.

Come, my merry one, and sing with me,
All by the firelight, gaily glowing,
There’s a whole wide world out there for you to see,
But the night is dark, and filled with terrors,*
So sing, sing, sing, sing,
sing, sing, sing, sing,
sing, sing, sing, sing,
My merry one

Come my bravest one and fight with me,
All in your armour, brightly gleaming,
There’s a whole wide world out there for you to see,
Your enemy’s near and great in number,
So fight, fight, etc…
My bravest one.

Come, my jolly one and drink with me,
Where wine and beer are freely flowing,
There’s a whole wide world out there for you to see,
And bring back tales of your valour,
So drink, drink etc
My jolly one.

Come, my hungry one and feast with me,
All in your best coat, or your leathers,
There’s a whole wide world out there for you to see,
But it wouldn’t serve to leave here starving,
So feast, feast, etc
My hungry one.

Come, my darling one and lie with me,
With naught between but breath and longing,
There’s a whole wide world out there for you to see,
But the night is dark, and all too lonely,
So lie, lie, etc
My darling one.

Come, my fearless on and die with me,
All for the glory and songs hereafter,
There’s a whole wide world out there for you to see,
But our lives are short and ever changing,
So die, die, etc
My fearless one.
