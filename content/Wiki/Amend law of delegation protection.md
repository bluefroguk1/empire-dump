Replace the wording of the barbarian visitor law to read: ''Any delegations from barbarian nations who arrive on the field of anvil under a flag of peace shall have protection under the law as if they were imperial citizens for the duration of their visit and for their direct passage out of the empire.'' ''Proposed by Miaren, seconded by Segura.''

### Overview
* Amending the existing [[Create law of delegation protection|law]] to cover passage out of the Empire as well as activity at Anvil.
* The use of the word "delegation" explicitly means that they are sent as representatives, and are not wandering visitors or mobs.
* This changes the law to dictate that the delegation are not protected if they decide to take a ''scenic'' route home.

### Date
* Winter 378YE

### Campaign Outcome
* This amends the existing law.
