## Description

The Tombshroud Guardian is most often made of heavy segmented leather finished with ambergelt resin and carefully inlaid with weltsilver. It sees most use by scouts, spies, merchants, and others who find themselves operating for long periods of time in potentially dangerous situations. There is a tradition for sets of the armour crafted and sold in [[Necropolis#Longbeach|Crown's Quay]] to be [[Religious_skills#Hallow|hallowed]] by priests of [[Vigilance]] especially when being used by [[fleet]] captains trading in [[foreign ports]]. According to popular belief, when the armour is used dead spirits who have yet to pass into the [[The Labyrinth of Ages and the Paragons and Exemplars|labyrinth of ages]] are drawn to the wearer and offer a little of their essence to revitalise the wearer in whatever battle they are engaged.

Building on these legends, the [[Imperial Orcs]] call this armour a ''Shaman's Beacon''. They claim that when they call on the revitalizing energy bound into the armour their renewed energy comes from their [[Imperial Orcs religious beliefs#Ancestors and hero points|ancestors]], and they often hear them more clearly than normal when they evoke its power.
