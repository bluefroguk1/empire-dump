## Overview
The Ambassador to Jarm is an [[Imperial title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The title was created as a consequence of the [[embassy]] [[commission|commissioned]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Construct_Jarmish_Embassy|Winter 377YE]]. While work was completed after the Summer Solstice 378YE, wrangling continued for several months. The Jarmish House of Princes demanded that the Empire select one of the three primary ports - northern [[Principalities_of_Jarm_ports#Kavor_.28Northern_Principalities_of_Jarm.29|Kavor]], southern [[Principalities_of_Jarm_ports#Vezak_.28Southern_Principalities_of_Jarm.29|Vezak]], or upstart eastern [[Principalities_of_Jarm_ports#Rigia_.28Eastern_Principalities_of_Jarm.29|Rigia]] as the location for an Imperial embassy - an obvious move to entangle the Empire in the internicine internal wranglings of the Jarmish government. The [[Define_Jarmish_embassy|decision]] was made to choose Rigia, and formal relations between the two world powers opened shortly afterwards.
