## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 

This ritual targets a [[fortification]], and must be performed in a strong Day [[regio]] in the [[territory]] containing the fortification. If the territory is part of the Empire, then it may instead be performed from the [[Regio#The_Imperial_Regio|Imperial regio]]. 



### Effects
Over the coming season, the target [[fortification]] becomes a beacon for defenders in a [[territory]]. The garrison and any assigned [[military unit]] become focused on identifying threats to the territory and its people, while empowering them with clarity and focus that allows them to swiftly identify hidden threats.

If there is a [[spy network]] operating in that territory it takes significantly more effort to gain useful intelligence - the thresholds for information are increased by two-fifths. Any efforts to infiltrate the territory by a hidden force may be laid bare to the Empire depending on the situation (may trigger a wind of fortune if such forces are present).

At the next event the captain of any military unit assigned to defend the fortification will receive a report in their pack detailing the information their soldiers have uncovered. The report contains information about any foreign spy network operating in the territory along with details of any enemy [[Imperial army|campaign army]] that undertakes an attacking order in the territory including their allegiance; an estimation of their strength; the name of their general, and information about their special qualities.
