### Overview
This army began with a core of orcs who had been slaves in [[Varushka]], [[Temeschwar]], and [[Wintermark]]. Vicious fighting against the Varushkan armies had decimated the numbers of the freed slaves in that nation, and harsh winters had contributed further to the death toll. After the revolt, their numbers were supplemented with orcs who had been enslaved by the [[Highguard|Highborn]]. The first magicians among the Imperial Orcs belonged to this army, however; they found it easiest to absorb the teachings of the Varushkan and Wintermark tutors the [[Urizen]] [[Urizen magical traditions#Mages|mages]] arranged for them. The hard core of the army were made up of many who had known [[Imperial Orcs history|Thrace]] and the other founders of the revolt personally, and they continued to develop the vision of freedom that had first spurred them to escape the mines.

Today the [[Winter Sun]] is the more politically active of the two Imperial Orcs armies, but it is also the army most likely to use magic in pursuit of their goals. They garner favours, both through military aid and careful use of their magical resources. More [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#Warcasters|warcasters]] and [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#Oathwrights|oathwrights]] fight under the banners of the Winter Sun than the Summer Storm, and they have more [[Preachers]].

The Winter Sun is a [[Imperial armies#Large|large]] army with a history of fighting in difficult terrain. Following a ritual performed at the Autumn Equinox 381YE, the soldiers and associated of the Winter Sun experienced [[Chain_around_my_leg|powerful visions]] of the many generations of ancestors who had lived as Imperial slaves. [[Chain_around_my_leg#Hammers_and_Chains|Embracing these visions]] the general, Bloodcrow Morg'ur, helped to change the direction of the army towards [[Army qualities#Freedom Fighters|fighting for freedom]].

The first Imperial orc General leads the Winter Sun, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Winter solstice.
