Lucinda lifted her spectacles and squeezed the bridge of her nose. From the direction of the stage came a muffled clatter and the sound of raised voices.
"You imbecile Frederick! You're meant to be [[The Witch|the Witch]] as Gancio and you have all the enigma and allure of a [[Horse|horse]] apple!"
"And you're meant to be a sophisticated urbanite and not some Tassatan arsehole who has just slid off the back of a wagon from [[The Marches|the Marches]]!"
There were more raised voices, and the sound of something breaking. Lucinda hoped it was nothing expensive. From the sounds of it, the two leads were attempting to stab each other for the third time in four days. She hoped they were using prop daggers for a change; they opened before [[The Prince|the Prince]] in two nights and if [[The Witch|the Witch]] and [[The Doctor|the Doctor]] were in the hospital - or worse, under arrest - it could mean a lost patron. Or - unthinkably bad! - an offended one...
She needed a drink badly, and looked longingly towards the bottle of Amontillado on top of the cabinet. It was probably too early... but given she had not been to sleep in some time, she thought she could convince herself it was actually very late.
She stood up, grabbing a cup and checking it for spiders, and picked up the bottle.
Someone cleared their throat behind her.
She turned, feeling guilty, until she saw that it was just Amelia. Or "the Black Spot" as she preferred to be called when working.
"It's a little early, isn't it? Even for an actor."
Lucinda put the Amontillado down and scrounged up a second cup. She grabbed a different bottle - an acceptable Black Unicorn vintage from [[Dawn]]. She poured them both a generous measure of white wine.
"I assume you've brought my crystals?" asked Lucinda, sipping.
Her guest made a face behind her sable mask. An expensive face, if Lucinda was any judge.
"There's a problem..." Amelia had the grace to pretend to look uncomfortable.
"Of ''course'' there is," said Lucinda. "How much?"
"Even at the cheapest price I can find it, It's nearly double what we agreed I'm afraid. First there was that [[Business|business]] after [[Winter]] with the peculiar crystals, but now... it seems that whatever it is that has hit your sources has hit ''everyone''. I even tried old Rigo from up north - he says the same thing is happening in [[Temeschwar]]. There's talk down at the Oloroso that it's in both Tassatos, and in [[Holberg]] too. Nowhere else though."
Lucinda hid her desperation behind an actors blank face. Her [[Troupe|troupe]] were short - badly short - and she had been relying on Amelia to provide the rest of the mana she needed.
"Have you any contacts [[On the other side|on the other side]] of the bridge? Someone on the Coast who might have the merchandise at a reasonable price?"
Amelia looked thoughtful.
"Not for crystals... but how does your [[Troupe|troupe]] feel about mixing something up with your slap?" She mimed slapping makeup on her face. "It might be the only way to do it in time, with the money you have..."
Lucinda finished her wine in a single long gulp. She imagined how much fun it was going to be trying to control Frederick and Alo during a [[Leaden Quicksilver|leaden quicksilver]] rush - especially given the bad mood everyone seemed to be in. But the alternative was disappointing [[The Prince|the Prince]]... and failing to perform the [[Magic|magic]] he was paying for was not an option.
She could feel her headache starting again.
"Do it. I'll explain to the troupe what is happening. If nothing else, it [[Will|will]] separate those who can act from those who have merely made a profession of moving in an interesting way while looking pretty."
## Overview
Shortly after the [[Spring]] Equinox, a vicious malaise crept over the cities of [[The League]]. Despite their geographical separation, it hit [[Sarvos]], [[Temeschwar]], [[Tassato]] and [[Tassato]], and [[Holberg]] simultaneously.
Most citizens seemed oblivious but the magicians of [[The League|the League]] - whether troupe dramaturgist at the height of their career, or the lowest street [[Mage|mage]] creating bonds for a handful of rings - were all too aware of it.
The malaise made some lethargic and restless, while others became short-tempered and aggressive - leading unfortunately to several deaths both in common brawls and ill-considered duels. Even those with enough self control to avoid the extremes feel restless, unsettled and short of concentration. Headaches are rife, as are sleepless nights.
The weather does not help - and that is something the mundane population does notice. It is too warm. Even in Temeschwar, where Summers tend to be short and barely distinguishable from the Spring and [[Autumn]] that bracket them, the temperatures are soaring. There is no wind to take the edge off; and precious little rain to clear the air. Even with the modern conveniences of the [[League]], a great city is not the best place to be when the weather is too hot. Worse, there is the threat of fire...
The situation is especially bad in Holberg of course - too many years of fighting against the [[Druj]] have left the sewers in a dreadful state of repair. Years of bloody rivers have not helped - when the wind is from the south they say you can smell the rot of the Morass from the walls. Those who can are getting out of Holfried for the [[Summer]], looking for cooler climates.
In [[Sarvos]] where the Summers are ''usually'' hot, this year is one of the worst on record. There have been incidents where people fall down in the street, insensible. People are actually paying for drinking water. Layers are shed left and right, and every eating-house or drinking-den is putting tables and chairs on the streets - which has led to congestion and arguments about right-of-way, and perhaps inevitably to brawls.
It is only the river that has prevented Tassato exploding in a riot - and that's at it's lowest ebb since the dreadful Summer of 296YE. In some places, things that might better have been left submerged have started poking out of the water. There is a constant worry about what [[Will|will]] happen if there is a fire - with the water levels low, there might not be enough accessible to [[Fight|fight]] a major fire. Coupled with the raids from the [[Jotun]]...
While short tempers and poor sleep and the heat can all be endured, there is a more sinister aspect to this malaise - one that hits the troupe magicians especially badly. All the mana sources in [[The League territories|the League territories]] have without warning slackened off and produced only half the normal crystalline mana. It does not matter whether the site was on a well-maintained estate in the forests around Temeschwar or a mean little cellar in Tassato Mestra.
## Significance
While the hot weather is a problem for everyone in the cities, the magicians of the League find themselves particularly affected. You may wish to role-play being more short-tempered and aggressive - or more lethargic and despondent. Regardless, your personal mana is not affected. The effects are likely to be muted in [[Anvil]], but may take some time to fade completely.
The decline in magical energies has also caused several weak [[Regio]] to collapse completely. In one case, the [[Regio|regio]] was in use at the time and led to several severe injuries.
After a few days of [[Confusion|confusion]], the mystery about what is happening is quickly dispelled. Divinations reveal that all four League cities are labouring beneath the effect of the [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Curse|curse]] known by the voluminous title of [[Icy Maw Devours the Spark of Essence]]. The worst of the effect ''should'' fade over the Summer Solstice... but until then every [[Magician|magician]] based in the League will suffer.
The real mystery lies in ''who has done this''. [[Rituals]] do not cast themselves, after all. More to the point, the curses must have originated within [[The Empire|the Empire]] - either through the [[Anvil]] regio or by a ritual performed in a Winter regio in each of [[The League territories|the League territories]] during the Spring Equinox.
This is not the first time that the League has encountered this kind of problem - several historians in Sarvos have pointed to an incident involving a dispute between magicians in the City of Jewels and neighbouring Siroc which resulted in an almost identical situation - but one restricted to the southern city alone rather than effecting all four great cities.
Others mutter about [[Agramant]], and his cultists but they are generally dismissed as a paranoid ...
## Resolution
Shortly after the Summer Solstice, the effects of the curses fade from all four cities and do not recur.
