"Read it again." she said in a tone that brooked no argument. Jenny Stock's eyesight was so bad she struggled to read in poor light, but the Abbess' voice had lost none of its steel. He'd read the summary of [[Synod]] judgements twice now already and it was not a short list, but he resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Failing eyesight or no, if his Abbess caught him doing that she'd box his ears. "[[Judgement]] 4. The [[General]] [[Assembly]]. Rafael Barossa di [[Tassato]]..."
By the time Robin had finished the list for the third time, his voice was getting hoarse and he was openly eyeing the pitcher of fresh water on the Abbess' desk. Jenny ignored him, continuing to pace up and down as she'd been doing since the first recital.
"Good, good, good. So that's the Cinderpath exchange, the Invisible Cord Brokerage..." her voice trailed off as she started counting commissions on her fingers. She finished her reckoning and then turned to face Robin. "By my tally there's still the potential for at least two maybe three more." 
"Err... there is?" he asked, trying to work out what on earth she was talking about.
"Yes, yes... But we'll need to push! We can't afford to lose this momentum. Bartimaeus' words have roused people from their slumber, but it won't last. We need to pick the apples while they're still green. We've sat back and let the nationals do our work for us. It's time for the [[Prosperity]] [[Assembly]] to strive and toil."
"Right." Robin had no idea what he was agreeing to. The Abbess hated explaining herself, better to just nod.
She beamed at him, her eyes twinkling with obvious pleasure. Filled with hope, Robin allowed himself the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to cast a meaningful glance in the direction of the pitcher of water, but his Abbess was already barking orders at him.
"Fetch parchment, quills, ink, and sand immediately. We'll need to write letters, four at least today."
No water for him then. The prospect of spending the entire morning taking dictation from the old woman caused him to roll his eyes in protest - though not before he'd turned his back to go and do as she'd instructed.
## Overview
Audio|link=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkcyAiU5w9A
Over the last year or so, [[The Empire|the Empire]] has wrestled with the contentious question of how [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s most precious resources should be allocated. Now the civil service have prepared details for the the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to construct a trading hall in Valashal as well as making clear that the Blackfield Market and the Parador of Dust are still viable, though neither opportunity [[Will|will]] exist for much longer as the impact of the three mandates endorsed by [[The Synod|the Synod]] following the [[Winter]] Solstice 382YE is now waning.
Keen to seize the moment before it passes a group of prosperous Varushkans have identified a way to take advantage of a recent opportunity that the Dawnish failed to capitalise on, seeking to increase their share of the trade on [[The Semmerlak|the Semmerlak]]. By contrast, a Marcher [[Friar|friar]] suggests that the [[Cardinal of Prosperity]] should use their leadership and influence in the [[Prosperity]] Assembly to pass their own [[Mandate|mandate]], bypassing the national assemblies, and seeking to identify new [[Opportunities|opportunities]] in the Empire directly.

The current hall at Valashal was constructed on the site of a much older hall, the Runehall. According to legend the Runehall was built by a Troll the scops named The Torn Light of [[Night]] Falling but it was said to be cursed. Brigid razed the Runehall to the ground and had fresh timber and stone brought in so that no part of the original remained. Over time the settlement grew and now a [[Suaq|suaq]] [[Icewalker|icewalker]] named Artja Fivefeet has proposed the construction of the Kauppahall, a new trading hall that would allow merchants from southern [[Hahnmark]] and northern [[Kallavesa]] to bring their goods here for sale.
Artja's Kauppahall is an unusual design that requires 16 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] and 32 crowns and would take 3 months to construct. The hall is actually a pair of twinned buildings, laid out to resemble the curving forms of the [[Rune|rune]] [[Lann]]. The Kauppahall would facilitate trade in stone from the nearby hills helping to enrich Valasmark as well as creating an opportunity for whoever is appointed to oversee the trading hall to buy small quantities of White granite when they come up for sale. This position would be an [[Imperial Title]], the [[Talon of Kauppahall]], and would need to be a [[Wintermark]] national [[Appointment|appointment]] to be effective. The civil service advise that the constitutional method of [[Appointment|appointment]] would be for an annual appointment by [[Tally of the Votes|tally of the votes]], allowing leaders of [[Wintermark]] military units to decide who should hold the position.
As well as white granite, the nearby hills produce the odd ring of Ilium, which might also be available on the market. Fearful [[Children|children]] claim that this ilium is Torn Light's final [[Legacy|legacy]] and that it is cursed, but there is no truth to this. Every [[Magician|magician]] who has ever examined the ilium that is found here confirms that it is pure and unsullied by any [[Curse|curse]].

Of all [[The Nations|the nations]] in the Empire, [[Varushka]] is by far the richest in terms of natural resources with deep seams of valuable metals and vast forests of high quality timber. The bustling port of Korotny, situated in the east of [[Karov]], lies on the north-western shores of [[The Semmerlak|the Semmerlak]], where it benefits from substantial trade with [[Dawn]] and [[Holberg]] as well as the rich resources of the [[Territory|territory]]. Only the ever present threat of the [[Thule]] exists to check its ambitions. 
The local boyars waited with interest to see how the Dawnish would respond to the opportunity to build the Star Metal Market in Lacre. These wealthy Varushkans have grown rich from the lake-trade and welcomed the prospect of new markets opening up but they are quick to seize the chance when the Dawnish opted not to pursue it. Under the leadership of Oksana Lyava Pinavora, they swiftly they put forward an alternative plan.
The plan involves enlarging and expanding the current docks, and would require 18 wains of white granite and 36 crowns. It would take three months, and once complete would also create an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] - Harbour Master of Semmerlak - that would oversee the docks and take advantage of the opportunity to purchase [[Bourse]] [[Materials|materials]] at a reasonable price. The civil service advise that the constitutional method of appointment would be for an annual appointment by [[Tally of the Votes|tally of the votes]], allowing Varushkan [[Mine|mine]] and [[Forest|forest]] owners to decide who should hold the position.
In addition to opening up a useful new market for bourse resources, the docks would become the natural place to sell any ilium found in the Semmerlak, allowing the Harbour Master to benefit from this trade also.

* Constructing the Blackfield Market would cost 12 wains of weirwood, 24 crowns in labour, and require a [[Senate|senate]] motion, or wayleave
* Refurbishing the Parador of Dust would cost 16 white granite, 32 crowns and require a senate motion, or wayleave
The civil service indicate that two previous opportunities are still available. The Marchers could [[Commission|commission]] the Blackfield Market and the [[Freeborn]] could construct the Parador of Dust.
Constructing the Blackfield Market would require 12 wains of weirwood, 24 crowns in labour costs, and the use of a Senate motion or Imperial Wayleave. It would take three months, and once complete would also create an Imperial Title - ''Blackfield Bailiff'' - that would oversee the market and take advantage of the opportunity to purchase Bourse [[Materials|materials]] at a reasonable price. The constitutional method of appointment would be for an annual appointment by tally of the votes, allowing Marcher [[Farm]] owners to decide who should hold the position.
Refurbishing the Parador of Dust would require 16 wains of white granite, 32 crowns in labour costs, and the use of a Senate motion or Imperial Wayleave. It would take three months, and once complete would also create an Imperial Title - ''[[Mistress of the Dust Parador]]'' - that would oversee the market and take advantage of the opportunity to purchase Bourse materials at a reasonable price. The constitutional method of appointment would be for an annual appointment by tally of the votes, allowing Freeborn [[Fleet]] owners to decide who should hold the position.
## A Market Too Many
* The [[Public auction|public auction]] [[Will|will]] receive no more weirwood if the Korotny docks are expanded
* The [[Public auction|public auction]] will receive no more mithril if the Parador of Dust is refurbished
* The public auction will receive no more white granite if the Blackfield Market is expanded or the Kauppahall is raised
* The Blackfield Market and the Kaupahall are in opposition to each other, the returns will be split if both are built
There is a significant problem. All these opportunities for markets, trading halls and the like work by diverting resources to national markets that would normally be sent to [[Anvil]] for public auction instead. The supply of white granite going to the public auction has already halved following the construction of the Cinderpath Exchange. If the Blackfield Market is expanded ''or'' the Kaupahall is raised then the regular supply of white granite will end. If ''both'' are commissioned and completed, then the prices would increase and the quantity available at both the Kauppahall ''and'' the Blackfield market would be halved, for as long as both establishments remained operable.
Likewise if the Parador of Dust is refurbished, then the remaining supply of mithril to the public auction will end, and if the Korotny docks are expanded then the remaining supply of weirwood will end.
Once the supplies to the public auction are being disposed of in this way, there will be no new opportunities in the future to [[Commission|commission]] a [[Ministry|ministry]] in this way.
The reward for a good job is [[More work|more work]].
## An Unspent Coin
* For the next year, the [[Cardinal]] of Prosperity can submit a special [[Mandate|mandate]] to the Assembly of Prosperity
* If the mandate is passed with a [[Greater majority|greater majority]] it will create an economic opportunity in the named territory
* The current [[Cardinal of Prosperity]] is Onan of the Chantry of the Silver Skull, but the title is up for appointment during the Winter Solstice.
Perhaps the most unusual response to Bartimaeus' mandate comes from the Jenny Stock, the Abbess of Stockwater [[Monastery|monastery]]. Jenny is renowned for her adherence to the Virtue of Prosperity and decades ago she rose quickly to become the youngest abbot in the [[Monastery|monastery]]'s three hundred year [[History|history]]. Although she rarely leaves the monastery these days, the Abbess still takes a keen interest in the statements and mandates of the Assembly of Prosperity. She has not shied away from sharing her frustration at the indifferent response from some nations so now she proposes to tackle the problem at its source. Rather than wait for national assemblies to promote opportunities for commerce in their nation, she argues that the Assembly of Prosperity should take matters into their own hands.
There are three things that should never be made: Food that goes uneaten, coin that goes unspent and [[Magic|magic]] that goes unused. We send ''(named priest)'' with 25 [[Liao|liao]] to (named territory) to urge all prosperous citizens to seek out new opportunities for commerce and development in their lands putting forward their proposals for consideration at the next summit.
Jenny proposes that the [[Cardinal]] of Prosperity should submit a suitably-worded mandate that identifies a single region or territory in the Empire. The mandate would need to urge followers of Prosperity who dwell there to seek opportunities to develop trade and commerce in their lands so that suitable proposals could be put forward for consideration at the following summit at [[Anvil]]. She provides an example of the wording that could be used for the mandate, but also points out that the cardinal could try and use the wording of each mandate to provide additional guidance on what sort of opportunity the Assembly were looking for in the named territory.
The civil service calculate that for the next year, if the Cardinal of Prosperity put forward a mandate like this and it was endorsed with sufficient [[Liao|liao]], then it would definitely give rise to an Opportunity in that territory at the next summit. These mandates could create opportunities for increased trade or production in common materials like mana crystals, [[Herbs|herbs]], ingots, measures and similar, they would not be able to provide opportunities for increased production of Bourse resources such as mithril or ilium.
In normal times this mandate only requires a simple majority, but at present ''all'' Synod mandates require a greater majority to be effective, due to the actions of the [[Wisdom]] Assembly.
## Resolution
During the Winter Solstice the [[Imperial Senate]] commissioned Kauppahall and the Parador of Dust. There are problems with the Kauppahall commission however; the method of appointment mentioned by the Senators is unconstitutional.
The opportunity to [[Construct Blackfield Market|construct Blackfield Market]] has now lapsed; interest has waned and the construction of Kauppahall will leave no resources available to be bought by the Marcher [[Ministry|ministry]].
The opportunity to create a market in [[Karov]] remains for the time being, but again interest is likely to wane as time goes by; certainly by the end of the [[Summer]] Solstice 384YE the opportunity will be lost.
Following the Solstice, Bartimaeus of the Prosperity Assembly enacted a mandate to encourage the citizens of [[Redoubt]] to seek ways to increase their prosperity.
