The grim figure pUlled itself out of the water. Peripherally it resembled a [[Draughir]], with long dripping hair obscuring its face. The figure was pale and somewhat bloated, its skin a patchword of livid scars, its only Visible eye milky white with cataracts. On its back it wore a large leather satchel which bulged in ways that made the creature look even more deformed. Rather than stand, it pulled itself along the floor with muscular arms, dragging its limp and broken legs behind it as it approached the wooden throne in the centre of [[The Chamber]].
A servant moved forWard, offering to help it up. It scowled at the girl, baring its broken teeth at her. She backed quickly away. The creature heaved itself and its heavy load onto the wooden Throne, squirming around to face the other inhabitant of the ritual chamber.
Its voice was hoarse, unMusical. It wheezed from time to time, as if labouring for each breath.
“Greetings to Zamashka ... Prince of Votika. The Bound King ... sends to you his ... personal greetings. He thanks you for your ... generous tribute. In [[Recognition]] of ... your gift ... he offers a hope that you may ... live long. He also offers you ... gifts ... in the surety that you will ... use them wisely.”
The herald slid the satchel from its back and fumbled with the clasp. With thick, malformed fingers it withdrew a selection of items, offering each in turn to the the Magician Prince that stood before it. First a fine shield; then a crude cauldron; an orb of polished and engraved bone; and finally a glass vial of crimson liquid. [[The Prince]] inclined his head as each item was presented, and gestured to the servant who took each item gingerly and placed them on the low table to the left of Zamashka.
They were treasures, indeed. He was pleased with his success - but especially anxious to take custody of his final prize.
“Finally ... O Prince Zamashka ... Lord [[Sorin]] has granted you ... ten more years ... of life. You shall not die ... when your life would run out ... provided you ... avoid the spite ... of your ... enemies.”
The creature made a ghastly rattling, coughing noise and its body convulsed and shook as it slid down off the chair onto the floor of the ritual chamber. 
Prince Zamashka realized with a combination of disgust and unease that the twisted creature was trying to laugh.
## Overview
During the Winter Solstice, the rules of the wasteland - Eternals of Winter - offered opportunities to win their favour with tribute of dragonbone. Some of their boons were won by representatives of [[The Empire]]; some were won by other nations. Some of the boons have already been put into action; others have not yet been received.
On the last day of Winter, a number of heralds visited the Empire to reveal the detail of which of the many offered boons had been won by which of the peoples invited to attend the [[Eternal]] courts. The heralds say that between the nations, thirteen-hundred measures of dragonbone were given in tribute, the lions share gifted by the people of the Empire ... but they were not the only folk to win boons.

## Significance
Several of these boons have already been implemented, others will fall into place over the coming months. In certain cases those boons may prove tricky to use - in particular, the claiming of a boon from Agramant apparently by the Hierro orcs of Segura causes a difficult legal situation.
Of the other claimants, only Zamashka, Prince of Votika is well-known. An extremely powerful Magician-Prince of Jarm, and a leader of the Southern Alliance, Votika is known to be a [[Grandmaster]] of the lore of winter and a wily and dangerous player of the game of princes.
Of particular concern to the Empire are the threats to the Court of the Fountain in [[Redoubt]], and to the person of Gabriel Barossa and the Wolves of [[War]] - especially as these threats apparently come from the people of [[Axos]] who were believed to be at least somewhat friendly to the Empire. No doubt there is more going on here than meets the eye!
