## Victory in [[Segura]]
Carlos applauded as Trystane's song ended. "Its a good song," he said, "but so typical of the Dawnish [[Troubadour]] to sing of the glories of their own people. You should sing more of the [[Red Wind Corsairs]] for [[The Empire]]'s victory in Segura was truly their doing. What is more Virtuous than a people Fighting for their homeland?"
Trystane's smile did not go much beyond his lips. "You'll find my song is accurate, [[Sutannir]]. Without the [[Eastern Sky]] and the [[Hounds of Glory]], Segura would be the homeland of the Lasambrians. Two Dawnish armies to [[The Brass Coast]]'s one. The victory in Segura was ours."
Carlos shrugged, "You needed two Dawnish armies to keep up with the Red Wind Corsairs. It was the Red Wind that drove the Lasambrians off the Iron Plains. You had your hands fUll of Summer [[Realm]] soldiers. Anyway, what say you, Harald? You follow the Path of [[Pride]], which of us has the right of it?"
Harald shifted in his seat uncomfortably, taking a drink before saying, "ClEarly the victory belongs to the Empire. We should celebrate together, should we not?"
Harald raised his drink. After a moment's pause, Carlos and Trystane followed suit.
Segura is now fully under the control of the Empire again. The victories of the Red Wind Corsairs, Eastern Sky and Hounds of [[Glory]] removed the Lasambrians' appetite for battle, pushing them to the negotiating table - and then off Imperial land.
Celebrations across the Empire are strongest within the Brass Coast and [[Dawn]] where the soldiers that gave their lives to restore this territory are remembered. This victory has stirred a spirit of military patriotism in these nations. Based on similar [[Events]] in the past, Imperial prognosticators know that applying the right form of enCouragement, whilst passions are riding high, can aid enlistment and the preparation of a new army. 
From past experience, the most effective way to provide this encouragement is through Statements of Principle made within the [[Imperial Synod]]. Specifically, if the [[Assembly]] of Pride chooses to validate a nation, then the citizens of that nation respond. Prognosticators observe that attempts to validate multiple nations, or the Empire, whilst Generally positive, do not elicit the same response from the populace. 
With specific reference to Segura:
* If the Assembly of Pride makes a [[Statement of Principle]] celebrating Dawn's efforts in reclaiming Segura, and the Senate approves the founding of an army in that nation, then the civil service estimates it will require 50 less [[Mithril]] to raise that army than it normally would owing to the fervour raised in Dawnish yeomen. 
* If the Assembly of Pride makes a Statement of Principle celebrating the Brass Coast's efforts in reclaiming Segura, and the Senate approves the founding of a navy in that nation, then the civil service estimates it will require 50 less [[Weirwood]] to raise that navy than it normally would owing to the zeal raised in Freeborn corsairs.
* If both nations are celebrated in the same, or different, Statements, then the impact on the citizens is diluted and the benefit is lost.
* It is noted that the [[General]] Assembly is regarded as having greater weight and authority than Virtue Assembles. Consequently, a Statement of Principle by the General Assembly could supersede that of the Assembly of Pride, but only after the Assembly of Pride had first made a [[Judgement]].
Note: This [[Opportunity]] is only available in the aftermath of this victory, which is to say that the [[Senate motion]] must be passed at the Winter Solstice, 378YE. If construction commences after this time, then it would be at full [[Cost]].
## Resolution
The Assembly of Pride celebrated the achievements of the Brass Coast in reclaiming Segura. The resulting enthusiasm helped with the Mustering of the [[Freeborn Storm]] naval force.
