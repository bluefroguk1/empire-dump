Wulfid found Ellena in the Forge, sipping a glass of lemonade. The place wasn't very busy - it was the middle of the afternoon - so she bought herself an orange juice and joined her friend leaning against the bar.
"What are we doing?" she asked.
"People watching," replied Ellena and inclined her head toWard one of the tables where a small group was engaged in animated conversation.
"What have I missed?"
"I'm not entirely sure. It's either a pair of Highborn apothecaries looking to trade Healing Potions with three Corsairs, or it's a trio of corsairs with more weltsilver than they know what to do with who aren't sure what the potions are [[Worth]]."
The conversation became even more energetic. Voices were raised.
"That's a Sarcophan accent," said Wulfid. "So I think that means your Highborn apothecaries are actually ''Kruidenkenner'' narcotics traders."
One of the group stood up and pUlled a short blade, and within a moment there were weapons in several hands. The barwoman leant over, furiously gesturing.
"If you're going to do that, take it outside!"
There were muttered apologies, and everyone settled down again, but before the hubbub entirely died away a pair of Dawnish yeofolk carrying a strong box came in accompanied by four nobles of various houses and an obvious Asavean. When they saw the Sarcophan and the corsairs, everyone started shouting at once. Ellena finished her lemonade, put the glass on the bar, and stepped forward with her hands up to try and settle the dispute down. Wulfrid caught the barwoman's eye.
"Does this kind of thing happen often?"
The barwoman sighed, a long suffering sigh.
"Often enough that I think we ought to start charging a percentage of deals done, or at least getting them to set up a roster so this kind of thing doesn't keep happening.
## A Concoctions Market
* During the Winter Solstice, apothecaries from [[Faraden]] and [[Axos]] are Visiting [[Anvil]] to sell their unique wares
* They plan to arrange a small market outside the Forge starting at 2pm on Saturday
During the Autumn Equinox, a small group of Faraden traders visited Anvil. Representing one of the wealthy merchant families, they brought with them a number of unique concoctions with narcotic properties, and by all accounts did quite well out of the visit. This season, they've apparently returned to see about selling more of their stock and perhaps even arranging something more permanent. 
When they arrive at Anvil, a week before the Winter Solstice, they are apparently not alone. It's not clear how it happened, but they've been joined by a small number of Axou traders from the Tunnels of Kaban, who are by all accounts in a similar line of business. Together they've announced that they'll be operating a small "market"  outside the Forge on Saturday afternoon, intending to remain until all their stock is sold. The Faraden traders have suggested that anyone who wishes to know more may wish to speak to Sagremar i Zayden, of the New Promise Cartel with whom they apparently did some excellent business during their last trip to Anvil. The Axou, for their part, have been a little standoffish apart from to mention that as well as traders they're also keen to talk to Imperial apothecaries, should any be interested in attending.
## An Exchange of [[Pride]]
* Leofraed the Deft will facilitate an exchange of crafts over the coming season
* They will be at The Hub from 18:30-19:30 on Friday
[[Wintermark]] Runesmith Leofraed the Deft proposes an exchange of crafts between citizens as a demonstration of [[The Empire]]'s Pride in its crafters. They claim that although the Empire readily recognises the skill of its artisans, especially those of a warlike mien, those who labour to create fine crafts and beautiful art sometimes fail to get the fair acknowledgement they deserve. As such they are calling for Imperial citizens who take pride in their crafting abilities to join an exchange of creations over the coming season. At the Spring Equinox, each participant who provides a piece of art, craft, or similar endeavour will in turn receive another participant's creation, and a token of [[Recognition]] from Leofraed themselves. The runesmith hopes to meet with anyone interested in taking part or learning more about the exchange on the Friday of the Summit at the Hub. They'll be there from half-past six until half past seven. There's no need to bring anything to this meeting - it's as much for Leofraed to explain the details and gauge interest as anything else.
Game Information: Leofraed is looking to arrange an exchange of physical objects - not ribboned items necessarily but examples of arts and crafts made by players themselves in-character.
## An Auction of Opportunity
*[[Basileus Flint]] offers a chance for Imperials to play a game of cunning and Curses during the Spring Equinox
* Invitations to the game are strictly limited, but the [[Eternal]] plans to make three of them available during the Winter Solstice
* A herald named Brazen is hoping to meet representatives of Anvil's auction houses to discuss the sale of the invitations
Heralds from the City of Locks have announced that [[The Prince]] of the Black Vaults intends to run "A Game of Cunning and Curses" during the Spring Equinox. There are only seven places available at the table, and the winner’s prize will include the opportunity to act as Basileus Flint’s representative to the Empire for a year. The details of the game - the contest really - have not been released. The players will not need to be Magicians themselves, but they ''will'' need to be capable of reaching the Hall of Worlds - either under their own steam or via methods such as Pauper's Key or [[Ambassadorial Gatekeeper]]. 
Four of the places at the game will be by invitation to contestants hand picked by Basileus Flint themselves. The other three, however, the eternal intends to be "wild cards." As such they have dispatched one of their agents, the herald ''Brazen'' to Anvil to find someone (or multiple someones) to handle these invitations on their behalf.
Brazen will apparently arrive at Anvil around seven o'clock in the evening on Friday. They wish to meet representatives of the new auction houses of Anvil, which they understand have risen to proMinence in the wake of the announcements about the Bourse [[Public auction]]. They are keen to ensure that the invitations fetch a good price, and wish to see which auction house can promise them the best deal - with the understanding that if all goes well this may lead to further business not only from the City of Locks but potentially from the other cities of the Autumn [[Realm]].
## A Blade from the Past
* Vesela Lechovic is coming to Anvil to sell a sword apparently used during the [[Freedom Heresy]]
* The Varushkan trader will be arriving at the summit on Friday at 10 in the evening
''Vesela Lechovic'' is a Varushkan [[Warden]] recently returned from the [[Forest of Ulnak]], having finally completed their two years of service with the [[Golden Axe]]. Whilst Fighting in the [[Druj]] territory he came into possession of a sword that he describes as possessing a distinct spiritual [[Aura]] on it - perhaps even a hitherto unknown [[Hallow]]. For various reason the warden believes that the sword was a weapon used during the Freedom Heresy and is attending the upcoming summit to find someone who wants to own a piece of history. If he is correct, then it seems likely the spiritual aura is unlikely to be a mere hallow - the result of such a ceremony would have faded long ago unless of course it was created with True [[Liao]].
Vesela expected to arrive at Anvil around ten o'clock on Friday evening, heading for the Hub. He will first want to secure a practitioner of [[Day magic]] capable of performing the [[Skein of Years]] on the sword who is prepared to confirm its provenance, and perhaps an adept of [[Autumn magic]] as well to divine any unique circumstances surround the item's creation. Once he has secured signed provenances from such individuals, he intends to discuss the auction of the sword with representatives of the independent auction houses. He's in no doubt that a relic of such a significant part of [[Imperial history]] will certainly attract attention that should prove invaluable in establishing the reputation of such an endeavour.
## An Enchanter of Lye
*A noble and their yeofolk will be visiting Anvil to offer goods and services in exchange for beggar's lye
*They will be arriving at the Imperial [[Regio]] at 17:00 on Saturday
Displaced from Dawnguard by the Druj, the de Coyne fortunes are very much on the wane it seems - although few would be rude enough to point that out. What remains of the house is apparently sheltering in Ulvenholm, essentially camping out in pavilions and tents halfway between Arnet and the Pits of Brychel. A noble of the house, [[The Witch]] ''Ser Sevelan de Coyne'', has announced that they intend to attend Anvil during the Winter Solstice. Not for politics, but for an opportunity to take in some of the sights, meet their fellows, catch up on current Events and the like.
Coincidentally, they will be accompanied by a couple of yeofolk, including one of the de Coyne sensechals, ''Robin Counter''. Counter has let it be known that they are bringing certain treasures that may be of interest to practitioners of [[Summer magic]]. Specifically, Counter wishes to trade three talismans - magical foci that [[Empower]] ritual magicians who are performing [[Raise the Standard of War]] and [[Clad in Golden Raiment]]. The foci are reasonably unique, but rather than money Counter is interested in trading them for a significant amount of beggar's lye. Indeed, so rare are these talismans that Counter expects at least 20 lye for each one - more if there is sufficient interest. In addition to the foci, Counter says they will provide three performances of Raise the Standard of [[War]] on the first three military captains who can pay the asking price of 15 measures of Beggar's Lye. The de Coyne witches will provide all the mana; The Captains need merely turn up with their resources. 
Given Ser Sevelan has expressed an interest in observing some Rituals at the Imperial regio, Counter has proposed killing two [[Birds]] with one arrow. The party will be at the regio at five in the afternoon on Saturday, with the party retiring to the Forge after their business is concluded, and thence perhaps to the Dawnish camp for an hour or so. Ser Sevelan is particularly interested in meeting Lady Izett, the Mournful. 
Robin Counter reminds anyone interested in securing the foci or the rituals that under no circumstances should they bother Ser Sevelan about them; they are to deal with the [[Seneschal]] only.
## At the Bourse
* During the Winter Solstice, the Empire's [[Weirwood]] seats are available for [[Appointment]]
During the Winter Solstice, the Empire's Weirwood Bourse seats are available for appointment. There are seven such seats under Imperial control at the moment; six of them are Imperial in nature and one belongs to the [[Navarr]] nation.
### Imperial Auction
* The Public Auction takes place at three in the afternoon on Saturday at the Senate Building
The six Imperial seats - [[Canterspire Circle]], the [[Great Forest at Reikos]], the [[Golden Trees of Seren]], the [[Heartwood of the Great Vale]], the [[Hunt of Alderei the Fair]], and the [[Weirwater Vales]] - will be auctioned. Any Imperial citizen can hold such a title, if they can raise sufficient capital. (OOC Note: Each seat has a page on the wiki that includes details of how much they were auctioned for during previous events).
In addition to the weirwood seats, the [[Prime Factor of the [[Pallas]] Docks]] (a [[Ministry]] that imports weirwood from the [[Principalities of Jarm]]) is also due to be auctioned to the highest bidder.
Both [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] titles - special Imperial Titles that allow the holder to Commission a [[Sinecure]], Ministry, or [[Great work]] before the end of the Solstice - will be offered for auction.
Finally, the public auction will also see the [[Prosperity]] dose of True True Liao auctioned, with all funds raised going to the [[Imperial Synod]] virtue fund.
### [[Tally of the Votes]]
* The tally of the votes begins on Saturday morning and closes on Saturday afternoon
* Any eligible citizen can cast their vote by finding an [[Agent of the Bourse]] in the civil service Hub near the centre of the Anvil
In addition to the Imperial positions offered for public auction, there are a number of national positions that are available to be appointed during the coming Summit. In each case, any citizen who controls an appropriate personal resource is eligible to cast their vote for their preferred candidate. Voting opens on Saturday morning and closes Saturday afternoon around 4pm, shortly after the [[Auction of the Seats]] is completed.
One national Bourse seat is due to be appointed this season: Navarr [[Herb garden]] owners have the opportunity to determine who will control the [[Thimble]] for the coming year.
In addition to the weirwood seat, this winter will see the appointment of the [[Bailiff of the Grand Market]] and the [[Steward of Good Leaf Gardens]] by Marcher citizens who hold [[Farm]] resources; both [[Warden of the Trees and Hills]] and [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] by Varushkan citizens who own either mines or forests; and Four Seasons' [[Boneweaver]] elected by Imperial Orc citizens. In the latter case, the Imperial Orc must control a [[Military unit]], and the number of votes they receive depends not only on the size of the unit but on how many times it has supported an [[Imperial army]] in the last year. 
The [[Imperial Orcs]] will also be able to appoint their Bearer of the Imperial Orc Wayleave - the title is currently vacant, having not been appointed during the Autumn Equinox. This is done through Tally of the Votes, by appointment of Imperial Orc military captains.
In each case, any Imperial citizen of the appropriate nation can be appointed to hold the title - not just those eligible to vote.
## Resolution
Assorted citizens visited Anvil and undertook their business with varying levels of success.
