The hakima strode back and forth, wading through the long grasses, occasionally having to hitch up her long skirts to jump over a particularly deep divot or ditch. At no point did she take her eyes off the little pendulum she held out in front of her. He'd shyly asked if he could examine it when the hakima first came to the farm, and while she'd rolled her eyes at his curiosity, she'd let him see it. The stone's colour seemed natural and there was an irregular hole running right through it that showed no signs of having been drilled. On one side someone had carefully painted a peculiar little white sigil that put Nahiv in mind of his uncle's ships. It fascinated Nahiv nearly as much as the woman's companion did.
He glanced over to where the ''other'' stranger was sitting with his mother, sharing a glass of syrah. They weren't a human, or an orc. They had smooth azure skin, and eyes bigger than any he'd ever seen before. Long, straight green hair hung in braids down their back, almost to the waistband of their voluminous green trousers. What fascinated Nahiv most, though, were their hooves. He'd never met anyone with hooves before Unfortunately his mother had been quite clear that if he couldn't control his curiosity he would be sent back inside until the visitors left.
Suddenly the hakima stopped moving and called out "here!" loudly. She waved for Nahiv's mother and her other guest to come over, and he tagged along behind them, occasionally getting lost in the long grass.
"Here," said the woman again when they reached her, and poked the ground. His mother nodded, and hefted her spade. She looked over at Nahiv and he brandished his own spade with little enthusiasm.
"There's no need for that," said the other visitor, deep blue-green lips quirking in a gentle smile. They moved over to where the hakima had indicated, and squatted down, running their stubby fingers through the dry soil. The woman backed away, joining beside Nahiv and his mother at a short distance.
"I can hear you down there, brother spring," said the blue visitor, speaking almost to themselves. "Why don't you come up here? We're all very eager to meet you."
Slowly, as if straining against an invisible weight, the stranger straightened up. They took a moment to catch their breath then squatted down again with their fingers in the earth, then rose again. They did this twice more, and each time it seemed to Nahiv that it took more effort. Then with one last exertion, water suddenly started bubbling around the stranger's hooves. Nahiv's mother let out an undignified whoop, her normally serious face breaking into a big smile. She embraced the hakima, picked Nahiv up and swung him around. When she'd collected herself, she pulled a little purse out of her pocket and offered it to the hakima who took it with a nod and stowed it safely in her skirts.
"I hope you and your friend will stay with us tonight," said Nahiv's mother. "I've invited my cousin Ireena, and Matteo i Damalda to come break bread with us and they're both eager to talk about securing your services. You and your friend."
"It would be a pleasure," said the blue stranger before the hakima could respond. "At the very least, I think your little one here has a few questions they'd like to ask, and I'm looking forward to answering them."
All three of the adults looked down at him. He withered under their scrutiny which was variously stern, speculative, and approving.
"If you're sure..." said his mother slowly. "But I warn you Nahiv can talk the ears off a field of corn once he gets started..."
The blue stranger's laughter rippled and flowed like bubbling water, and they squatted down next to Nahiv. "The young are always curious! And it is never a chore to answer their questions. How else are they to learn anything?"
The hakima rested a hand on the blue stranger's shoulder, and squeeze gently, just once.
"And of course we will all be on our best behaviour when we answer those questions," they continued without missing a beat. "We will be particularly careful not to upset anyone by talking about anything that might cause a misunderstanding, or get anyone else into trouble."
They straightened up then, and offered to let Nahiv ride on their shoulders. After a nod from his mother, he did just that, and by the time they all reached the house together he'd entirely forgotten just how profoundly sad the stranger had looked, just  for a moment, when his mother had pulled out their purse of money.

## Overview
The Creed of the Rain guides me, and while the words are simple they can sometimes be hard to follow. "Don't [[Fight|fight]] when opposing is enough; don't harm when fighting is enough; don't wound when harming is enough; don't kill when wounding is enough, and take no joy in any of them. You can see why Lord Rain was subject to enmity for three hundred years, can you not?"
* The Imperial enchantment Hallow of the Green World has been cast
* The eternal Ossegrahn has taken the opportunity to send dozens of heralds to the Empire
* Their response has been guided by a plenipotentiary message from the Archmage of Spring
During the Winter Solstice, the [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] ''Sails of the First Flame'' evoked the powerful Imperial enchantment [[Hallow of the Green World]]. This is the first time the ritual has been performed in the Empire since [[The prime colour of the world|Spring 380YE]], and the first time since [[Ossegrahn|Lord Rain]] resumed contact with Imperial magicians. Heralds of Lord Rain have issued from Spring [[Regio]] across the Empire, offering aid and succour to anyone who will accept it. They are keen to converse with Spring magicians, with healers of all kinds, and with [[Forest|foresters]], [[Farm|farmers and fisherfolk]]. The powerful enchantment coincided with a [[Archmage#Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiary]] sent by the [[Archmage of Spring]], Ibiss Briarheart, and it [[Have you seen me lately|seems that]] message has helped guide Ossegrahn's priorities.
## Gentle Rain
* Several nights of magically infused rain have bred new life from stony ground
* Every farm in an Imperial territory has provided two drams of Marrowort in addition to its usual production
A week after the Winter Solstice, gentle rains begin to fall over [[Casinea]], which quickly spreads across every Imperial territory touched by the Hallow of the Green World. infused with magic by Ossegrahn, the rain is cool, refreshing, and wholesome. Between the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox, barely a week goes by without similar rains sweeping across the Empire. Crops sprout more readily, and grow more quickly. The trees seem more eager to wake from their winter sleep, enthusiastically sending out new buds and early blossoms. Young animals are healthier, thriving in the fields.
This blessing also means [[More work|more work]] however. The rain indiscriminately fosters plant growth, spawning weeds, ferns, brambles with as much enthusiasm as it does the crops farmers are actually planting. Among the shoots of corn and wheat, in the fields where sheep, goats, pigs, and shoat graze, and in the glades and orchards however, ''other'' plants are growing as well. Many farmers set aside a little ground to grow a few [[Herbs|healing herbs]], but this spring it seems like [[Marrowort]] in particular is growing on farms all over the Empire. Used by [[Surgical skills#Physick|physicks]] to treat the most grievous of injuries,  The herb bursts enthusiastically from soil left fallow over the winter. Fostered by the heralds of Lord Rain, every farm in a territory touched by Hallow of the Green World has produced two drams of the herb in addition to its normal production.
## From Stony Soil
* Any character with a level 1 farm can use the Blessing of New Spring ritual to begin upgrading that farm
* They must have Blessing of New Spring cast on their farm at every event they attend in 2023, starting from the Spring Equinox
* This method cannot be used at the same time as any other enchantment on the farm
* If they complete this task their farm will become level 2 between the Autumn Equinox and the Winter Solstice
Along with the gentle rains, heralds of [[Ossegrahn|Lord Rain]] visit farms and fisheries across the Empire. Apparently the [[Archmage of Spring]] asked Lord Rain to offer his help to Imperial farmers, and with the surge of Spring magic brought by the Hallow of the Green World, they are here to do just that. Many of them, especially those with green skin, have supernatural abilities of use to farmers. They can heal animals and plants, increase their fertility, find hidden sources of fresh water or cleanse water that has become polluted, revitalise tired soil, and generally spread lifegiving auras wherever they go. On the instruction of their master, they are sharing these gifts with any farmer who will accept them.
At the same time, Ossegrahn does not want to send his heralds where they are not welcome. As such, the  eternal has suggested a simple way for farmers to reassure his heralds that their aid is desired. The [[Blessing of New Spring]] is designed to work in conjunction with [[Strong Ox, Golden Sun]], and [[Gathering the Harvest]], each building on the previously cast rituals. As a consequence, Blessing of New Spring only helps a farm if it is performed in Winter. There is nothing to ''stop'' it being cast at other times; it simply has no measurable effect. Ossegrahn proposes that this simple ritual be put to a different use in the coming months, one that will let his heralds know that a farmer welcomes their assistance, as well as provide them with a renewing, empowering surge of Spring magic.
For the rest of the year - until the start of the Winter Solstice 385YE - whenever ''Blessing of New Spring'' is cast on a farm by an Imperial citizen it will draw a small number of heralds to the area. With the aid of Ossegrahn they can harness the Spring magic in the [[Enchantment]] and put it to a slightly different use - slowly but surely improve the health and fertility of the plants and animals  If the ritual is recast throughout the year at the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, and Autumn Equinox then by the start of the Winter Solstice the farm will have [[Farm#Upgrades|improved significantly]]. Unfortunately, this benefit will only be usable by those who have a standard farm - once a farm has been [[Farm#Upgrades|enlarged]] in any other way this general assistance will be ineffective. 
The opportunity also requires the heralds of Ossegrahn to be able to move freely around the Empire. If the Imperial Conclave declares Ossegrahn [[Alignment#Enmity|an enemy of the Empire]] before the start of the Winter Solstice then the opportunity is lost - Blessing of New Spring is not powerful enough to overcome enmity and allow heralds to visit the Empire in the kinds of numbers needed to support it..
### A New Blessing of Spring
We also say "The first lie is that this is needful, and all other lies flow from that."
If a character has the ritual cast on their farm at every Profound Decisions Empire event they attend during 2023 (other than the Winter Solstice which has already passed), then by the start of the Winter Solstice their farm will be upgraded from level 1 to level 2. If you aren't attending one of the three events, then the assumption is that you find someone off-screen to keep the ritual going. If you do not attend the Spring Equinox, then you can use this opportunity as long as you attend either the Summer Solstice or the Autumn Equinox and have the ritual cast. This is to ensure that the opportunity is still useful to anyone who for whatever reason is unable to make every event this year.
This opportunity is ''only'' available to characters with a standard farm. If the farm has been [[Farm#Upgrades|upgraded]] or is upgraded during the year, then the Blessing of New Spring will provide no additional benefit. Diversification does not [[Change|change]] the benefit; only permanent upgrades count. The actual Blessing of New Spring provides no increase to production when cast after the Winter Solstice, and this opportunity does not [[Change|change]] that. Indeed, as an [[Enchantment]], it stops other enchantments being performed on the farm. The opportunity is explicitly about choosing between the immediate benefits of enchanting a farm with magic that grants monetary benefits, or investing in longer term benefits at the cost of short term gain.
## Gifts of the Cupbearer
* Heralds have been offering aid with the desiccation of the Great Grasses
* The eternal has presented a number of arcane projections for the Empire
* These projections are gifts for the Sails of the First Flame coven, the Silver Chalice order, and the Landskeepers of the Marches
* Ossegrahn gives his blessing for any of these projections to be codified and added to Imperial or Urizen lore
At the request of the Archmage of Spring, some of the heralds of the ''Cupbearer'' have travelled to [[Madruga]] to offer their aid in dealing with the [[Enchanted#The Thirsty Grasses|spreading blight]] that threatens the [[Madruga#Great Grasses|Great Grasses]] and perhaps even the entire [[Territory]]. While there, they gain first hand experience of the [[Regrow the Land's Heart|healing magic]] that covers the territory, also woven by the Sails of the First Flame coven. In addition to helping to better understand the effect slowly turning the Great Grasses to ash and sand, one of the heralds carefully studies this new [[Spring magic]] and is apparently very impressed - as is their master.
A week before the Spring Equinox, a trio of delicate heralds arrive in the Empire with gifts from Lord Rain; three sets of [[Arcane projection|arcane projections]] prepared by his mortal allies. One set is delivered to [[Dhomiro]] Cassandra i Periera i Erigo, as a representative of the Sails of the First Flame. The second is given to Fausta Ankarien, the [[Grandmaster]] of the Silver Chalice, members of whose Order are also fighting to deal with the spreading blight. A third set has apparently been placed in the custody of the [[The Marches|Marcher]] [[Egregore|egregores]] who will hopefully be able to get them to the gathered [[Landskeeper|landskeepers]] of the Marches during the Spring Equinox..
The Cupbearer's emissaries say that these magics are partially inspired by the requests of the Spring Archmage and deal with helping provide fertility to farms, and aiding the Silver Chalice. Each arcane projection contains the seed of a ritual that draws on the power of the eternal. They are of limited use by themselves, but the ''Cupbearer'' explicitly gives permission for them to be codified at any [[College of Magic]] and entered into either [[Formulaic ritual#Imperial Lore and the Ritual List|Imperial]] or [[Urizen lore]]. Unlike normal arcane projections, each of these magical scrolls include an ''[[Ritual theory#Eternal Nature|assurance]]'' - a clause that will cause them and any ritual developed from them to lose all power if it is broken.
## Do Least Harm
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking. Healing herbs... heal. They do what they do? You can find new things to heal with them but you cannot find new things for them to do .
* Ossegrahn offers support to the Empire's healers via the Houses of Healing
As they go about their other business, the heralds of Ossegrahn look for ways to help the healers of the Empire Again, the Spring Archmage has provided some guidance. They have apparently asked if Ossegrahn would sponsor a college to study herb lore and the [[Surgical skills#Physick|healer's arts]] that would be similar to [[Make a deal#Thornsong House|Thornsong House]]. While they appreciate the sentiment, they don't believe such a thing is possible. Certainly they don't know of any way for a physick to use herbs in a way the Empire doesn't. 
The Archmage also asked whether Ossegrahn might provide aid to Imperial healers in a manner similar to the way the [[Tired of sleeping#The Tamazi|Tamazi]] [[Orc|orcs]] have [[Tired of sleeping#The College of Warcasting|recently supported]] the [[Preceptor of the Skarsind College of Warcasting|College of Warcasting]] in [[Skarsind]]. Once they understand what the College of Warcasting actually ''is'', most of them are faintly horrified. To say the servants of Ossegrahn are not entirely keen on the idea of training people to be better at using magic to kill would be an understatement. That doesn't make them any less enthusiastic about the possibility of offering direct, practical aid to those who work to keep people alive however, even if they do sometimes do it on a battlefield.
After some discussion, among themselves and with the Cupbearer himself, the heralds put forward a proposal. There are a number of [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] in the Empire and elsewhere who are friends and allies to Ossegrahn who will craft [[Magic Items|magical tools]] for the benefit of the Empire's healers.
He proposes the construction of ''Houses of Healing'' near [[Therunin#Peakedge Stead|Peakedge Stread]] in [[Therunin]], or at the [[Gardens of High Chalcis]] in [[Reikos]]. There are Spring regio near both locations that would serve as the foundation for their construction. In addition to providing a safe and tranquil location for the artisans to work, they would allow for the study of chirurgery, physick, herblore, and healing magic, and also provide healing to any who visited. A single individual would be appointed to oversee the Houses, who Ossegrahn proposes be called the ''Hand of the Healers'', and who would bear additional responsibilities both to the doctors and healers of the Empire and to the friends of Ossegrahn who support them. In return, the eternal would serve as a patron, guiding and inspiring healers to find ways to reduce the suffering in the world.

* This opportunity remains available until the end of the Autumn Equinox 385YE or until enmity is declared against Ossegrahn
Construction of the Houses of Healing requires a [[Commission]]. It costs 20 wains of weirwood, 40 crowns in labour costs, and will take three months to complete. The opportunity involves constructing a series of buildings intended to stand in harmony with their surroundings, centred around a Spring [[Regio]]. Only two locations have been suggested; near Peakedge Stead in Therunin, and near the Gardens of High Chalcis in Reikos.
Black lotus? That is a matter for orcs, and not for ''Willowbraid''. I know little of it beyond the fact that it does not thrive as other plants do, and that the orcs value it beyond all other treasures. You should speak to them.
Once complete, the Houses of Healing would create an [[Imperial Title]], the ''Hand of the Healers''. Ossegrahn intends his aid to potentially benefit any Imperial citizen, and mandates that the title be appointed either by [[Candidacy|Declaration of Candidacy]] in the [[Imperial Conclave]], or by [[Appointment by the Senate#Appointment|appointment]] of the [[Imperial Senate]]. They must also have three responsibilities; 
* to protect the Houses of Healing and all who work there or come as patients
* to strive to support healers throughout the Empire, both magical or mundane, helping them to overcome sickness and heal injuries wherever possible 
* to actively work to reduce suffering in the world, especially through the use of murderous curses or unnecessary violence. 
Obviously the eternal has no ability to force someone to actually live up to these responsibilities, but he feels that making them explicit will make it easier for the Empire to understand the importance Ossegrahn places on preserving life.
The ''Hand of the Healers'' will have access to ministries that allow them to purchase magic items intended to assist mundane and magical healers. Some of these items are unknown to Imperial crafters, being either secrets unique to a small group of artisans, or secured from sources outside the Empire. Unfamiliar items are [[#Tools of Healing and Protection|below]]. In each case, the artisans and merchants are individuals who have a good personal relationship with the Rainfather or one of his heralds. In addition, once each year, the Rainfather himself would provide the ''Hand of the Healers'' with a unique amulet for their personal use that would increase their personal healing abilities. OOC Note: This would take the form of a ribbon, and the player would need to provide their own physrep.
These powers are contingent on good relationship with Ossegrahn. In the event the Conclave declared enmity against him, they would be lost. There is no guarantee they would automatically be recovered if the Conclave later changed their mind. Without the support of Ossegrahn the Houses of Healing would simply revert to being a hospital (it would essentially be a [[Folly]]). 
This commission is a [[Opportunity#Building Opportunities|building opportunity]] which means some of the [[Commission#Necessary Details|necessary details]] are predefined.
The Spring of Grey Falls is protected by the Rainfather, and its sweet waters are a tiny treasure in a world of toil and suffering. How would it benefit ''anyone'' for us to speak openly of it, of its location? Those who need it can always find it, but those who seek it too often do so with the worst of intent. Best leave it be, friends.
## Take No Joy in Killing
* Ossegrahn offers to aid in the [[Fight|fight]] against the vallorn
Like [[Llofir]] before him, Ossegrahn and his followers apparently see the [[Vallorn]] as a sickness. While its power may grant life it does so at the cost of encouraging constant competition and suffering. They are staunch opponents of unnecessary violence in almost every situation, the heralds of Lord Rain are very much in favour of destroying the vallorn. Unfortunately, there seems to be little the Cupbearer can do about it himself. His powers revolve around healing and faced with a sickness of the very earth and air itself he has little direct aid to offer. Of course, while Ossegrahn may see it as an illness, the vallorn is actually a wellspring of life so it unsurprising the eternal cannot "heal" it. Indeed one of the effective weapons against many vallornspawn is magical venom, such as that created by the [[Unending Cascade of Blood's Fire]] or [[The Grave's Treacherous Edge]], which Ossegrahn is vehemently opposed to.
Those heralds who visit the Navarr in [[Hercynia]], [[Therunin]], and especially [[Miaren]], and who spend time talking with those [[Grey Pilgrim|Grey Pilgrims]] prepared to speak with them, are clear that their master wants to support those already fighting the vallorn. To that end, and after a great deal of discussion, they bring a proposal from their master to build a gathering place for those who want to deal with the vallorn's poison without resorting to destructive magic.
### Winewater Hall
Winewater Hall
Commission Type: [[Ministry]]
Location: Greenfalls, in Miaren
Cost: 20 wains of weirwood, 40 crowns, three months to construct

Forestmender
Type: National position
Appointment: Annual appointment; Unanimous decision of the Senators of Navarr
Powers: Control of two connected ministries allowing purchase of magic items to protect against the vallorn
Responsibilities: Use tools to [[Fight|fight]] the vallorn; protect people from the vallorn whether Imperial citizens or not; gather allies to help fight the vallorn
Restriction: If the Conclave declared enmity against Ossegrahn, the title loses access to the ministries

Ossegrahn has proposed that a place to study and prepare to fight the vallorn be established in Miaren because, more than anywhere else in the Empire, it symbolises victory over the sickness the vallorn represents.
There is also a Spring regio there, in the [[Miaren#Greenfalls|Greenfalls]] [[Territory#Regions|region]] of [[Miaren]], that would serve as the basis for the kind of structure Ossegrahn has in mind. Called the ''Winewater Spring'', this pool of fresh water is infused with rejuvenative energies that help [[Purify|cleanse venoms and poisons]] from those who bathe in them. ''Winewater Hall'' would require a commission, and cost 20 wains of weirwood, 40 crowns, and take three months to complete. 
Once complete Winewater Hall would create an Imperial title - the ''Forestmender'' - which Ossegrahn requires be a national position appointed by unanimous decision of the Navarr Senators. The eternal requires that the title have three responsibilities:
* to use the tools provided by Winewater Hall to help destroy the vallorn
* to strive to prevent the vallorn from harming people of any nation whether Imperial or not 
* to gather allies for the fight against the vallorn from Imperial citizens and other nations 
The eternal has no ability to force someone to engage with these responsibilities, but is clear that flaunting them is a good way to lose his friendship and patronage for Winewater Hall.
As with the [[#Healing Houses|Hand of the Healers]], the ''Forestmender'' will have access to several ministries that allow them to purchase magic items intended to strengthen those who fight the vallorn, especially those who need to venture into the [[Vallorn#Vallorn Miasma|vallorn miasma]]. Items unfamiliar to Imperial artisans are [[#Tools of Healing and Protection|described below]]. In each case, the artisans and merchants are individuals who have a good personal relationship with the ''Bogfearthan'' or one of his heralds. In addition, once each year, the Rainfather himself would provide the ''Forestmender'' with a unique amulet for their personal use that would increase their personal healing abilities.
This commission is a [[Opportunity#Building Opportunities|building opportunity]] which means some of the [[Commission#Necessary Details|necessary details]] are predefined.
I pointed out that several of these tools would be equally effective for fighting the Druj as they are for protecting people from the vallorn and the herald gave me ''such'' a look. I'm right though.
### The Greenwatch
The Greenwatch
Commission Type: [[Ministry]]
Location: Mareholm, in Casinea
Cost: 20 wains of white granite, 40 crowns, three months to construct
Effect: Creates the position of ''Greenwatcher'' who is able to purchase useful items from the followers of Ossegrahn
Time Limit: If Greenwatch is not commissioned by the end of the Autumn Equinox 385YE the opportunity is lost
Opportunity: This commission has required elements; if any are not all fulfilled the commission does nothing
Greenwatcher
Type: National position
Appointment: Annual appointment; Unanimous decision of the Senators of Highguard
Powers: Control of two connected ministries allowing purchase of magic items to protect against the vallorn
Responsibilities: Oversee Greenwatch, actively oppose the vallorn, help people threatened by the vallorn regardless of origin
Restriction: If the Conclave declared enmity against Ossegrahn, the title loses access to the ministries
Opportunity: This title has required elements; if any are not all fulfilled the title does not gain some or all of its powers

While the Navarr have been fighting the vallorn for a thousand years. Lord Rain is also aware that the people of Highguard have recently focused their own attention on curing its sickness. To the surprise of some, Ossegrahn also proposes supporting their efforts. There is a nameless Spring regio in the [[Casinea#Mareholm|Mareholm]] [[Territory#Regions|region]] of [[Casinea]], down on the very edge of the border with [[Brocéliande]], that could serve as the basis for such efforts. The trees there are old hardwoods, some of them older than human habitation of Casinea, and the streams that rise among them are infused with Spring magic that can help remove certain maledictions of sickness and infirmity. A structure here would symbolise the need to watch over the vallorn, and to remain every [[Vigilance|vigilant]] against the danger it presents. The ''Greenwatch'' would require a commission, and cost 20 wains of white granite, 40 crowns, and take three months to complete.
Once complete Greenwatch would create an Imperial title - the ''Greenwatcher'' - which Ossegrahn requires be a national position appointed by unanimous decision of the Highguard Senators. Only a Highborn citizen could hold this title. Ossegrahn requests - but does not ''require'' - that the title holder be either a [[Magister]] or a [[Grey Pilgrim|grey pilgrim]], especially if that would calm any fears the Highborn may have that he seeks to exert undue influence their people. He also requires that the title have three specific responsibilities however:
* to use the tools he provides to help destroy the vallorn
* to strive to prevent the vallorn from harming people of any nation whether Imperial or not
* to warn others of the danger presented by the vallorn, and ensure they take its threat seriously
The eternal has no ability to force someone to engage with these responsibilities, but is clear that flaunting them is a good way to lose his friendship and patronage for Greenwatch. 
As with the [[#Healing Houses|Hand of the Healers]], the ''Greenwatcher'' will have access to several ministries that allow them to purchase magic items intended to strengthen those who fight the vallorn, especially those who need to venture into the [[Vallorn#Vallorn Miasma|vallorn miasma]]. Items unfamiliar to Imperial artisans are [[#Tools of Healing and Protection|described below]]. In each case, the artisans and merchants are individuals who have a good personal relationship with the ''Bogfearthan'' or one of his heralds.

I know the Blood River. Before I was sent to the arena at Beoraidh, we lived in Mareave. It's not blood. It's the effluent from the mine. What can you do about that? Brother Harvest won't thank you for invading the Broken Shore, even if it's to try and heal a river.
The best thing the Empire can do for the people of Tsark is ''leave them alone''. They aren't hurting anyone, and that is a lot more than you can say for... well practically anyone else.
The Raincallers of the Tchemetzi are our friends, it is true. They have long served their people as healers, they know how to bring the gentlest of rains, and they receive the boons of Lord Rain to help them in their work. I wish they would give their service freely, but the people of Faraden, like those of the Empire, seem to place too much stock in the idea of never doing anything for its own sake. Eventually, I do not doubt, we will win them round and until then they do much good in a dry land.
## To Sow What You Do Not Reap
* While busy in the Empire the heralds of Ossegrahn have laid out a number of things that would win his favour
While the heralds of Lord Rain have been busy in the Empire, there has been some talk of what they expect in return. Some of them seem to find the idea genuinely baffling; they are helping because help is needed and because Ossegrahn asked them to do so. They're happy to accept gifts of food and drink, shelter, and good conversation, but attempts to actually ''pay'' them are met with polite indifference. There seems to be nothing transactional in the boons and blessings they offer; most seem genuinely happy to share. A few, however, seem to have a better understanding of the idea of ''quid pro quo''. They frame their lord's attitude to the Empire in terms of friendship. Friends help one another without expectation of payment, but rather in the understanding that their friends will help them in turn. Lord Rain expects no gifts or rewards for helping the Empire; this isn't a matter of favours or the expectation of future service. But friendship cannot be a one-way relationship. There are things the Empire could do that would make Lord Rain happy. If his Imperial friends refuse to do any of these things, then he will be saddened that they are simply taking advantage of his altruism. If he becomes sad enough, he will simply stop trying to be friends with the Empire, with the Imperial Conclave, with the Silver Chalice, and reserve his friendship for those who reciprocate it. 
### Amity
Ossegrahn would appreciate it if the Imperial Conclave were to declare that they are his [[Alignment#Amity|friends]]. If the Empire feels it can trust someone, it should welcome them into their homes. If it has doubts, it absolutely ''should not'' consider such a state of affairs. Being a friend makes one vulnerable; it is a state Ossegrahn thinks desirable but it always brings the risk of betrayal. For example, the Archmage suggested in their plenipotentiary missive that the Empire might build “an Embassy that is staffed by heralds” but in the same breath says they are ''not'' prepared to build a [[Fane]] under any circumstances. What does the Archmage think such an embassy would be if not a fane? Why would the magicians of the Empire profess friendship, yet balk at showing any trust? No, if the Empire is not sure of Ossegrahn, let the [[Alignment#Neutrality|current situation]] continue. Let ''individuals'' decide whether they are friends of the Ossegrahn or not, at least until the Conclave can decide if it wishes to be allies. If it never does, or if it once again decides that Ossegrahn is an [[Alignment#enmity|enemy]], then the eternal will accept their decision.
### The Threat of the Spider King
The best way to stop the Rot Lord from infesting your farms would be to... not let them? Without seeing what they do, we couldn't commit to helping mitigate any damage. More importantly though Llomon would need to think ''very carefully'' about whether to set himself against ''End-of-Empires''. Especially since, as I understand it, ''you'' attacked ''Llofir''. So I can see why they might be pissed off.
On the other hand, sometimes one must judge people by the company they keep. The eternal [[Arhallogen]] is a constant foe of Ossegrahn, and vice versa. The two are diametrically opposed in their beliefs about how creatures should interact with each other. One favours altruism, symbiosis, harmony. The other urges slaughter, pragmatism, and selfishness. One of the things that made Ossegrahn loathe to reach out to the Empire was the knowledge that they considered the ''Scorpion Queen'' to be their ally. That they have apparently come to their senses reassures Ossegrahn that he has not made a mistake, but he still worries the Imperial Conclave sees the ''Centipede General'' as fit to share their table with them. He would very much prefer it if the Conclave were to shun Arhallogen as it shuns the ruinous fury of [[Siakha]] and the twisting boons of [[Yaw'nagrah]]. If they don't, Ossegrahn worries that they will learn a very harsh lesson indeed. When one sits down to dine with a hungry beast, it is not just the bread and broth that gets eaten.
### Suffering Begets Suffering
[[Spring magic]] has a strong resonance for [[Spring magic#Venom|venom]] as it does for [[Spring magic#Healing and Vitality|healing, vitality]] and [[Spring magic#Fertility|fertility]]. Ossegrahn actively rejects this resonance, and sees it as a perversion of his realm. "''The only reason to study poison is so that one can heal it''". he says. The decision to interdict [[Rivers Run Red]] and the abomination that is  [[Mountain Remembers Its Youth]] played a major part in his decision to approach the  Ossegrahn would very much like the Conclave to interdict magics that deal with poison, starting with the rituals already in Imperial lore. These include [[Fetid Breath of Teeming Plague]], [[Fire in the Blood]], [[Curse of Gangrenous Flesh]], [[Unending Cascade of Blood's Fire]], [[Touch of Vile Humours]], and [[The Grave's Treacherous Edge]]. Ideally he'd like them to go further and also interdict rituals such as [[Sorin's Rite of Agony]] and [[Pallid Flesh of the Dead King]] which his followers argue glorify suffering as a route to power. In fact, if he had his way the Conclave would interdict all magical methods of creating venom including the [[Venom]] spell and any [[Magic Items|magic item]] that allows magicians or [[Heroes|heroes]] to inflict it on others.
Finally, he wants to be very clear that if the Imperial Conclave adds new rituals designed to cause suffering, or that poison the land or the waters, he will have to carefully consider his relationship with the Empire. The kind of twisted wickedness that composed ''Mountain Remembers its Youth'' is a sobering reminder that there are magicians who care not at all for the morality of their scholarship, after all.
### Spring College
Ossegrahn understands that healing is not purely a matter for the Spring realm; apparently this is a consequence of extensive discussions with his magician friends in the mortal world. He understands that [[Day magic]] excels at purifying sickness and poison, and that [[Summer magic]] can grant potent [[Enchantment|blessings]] that strengthen bodily health. At the  same time he knows that Spring magic is the ''best'' kind of magic for healing the ills and ailments of the world. He would very much like to see more Spring magic practiced in the Empire, and wonders why they have not built a [[College of Magic]] specifically dedicated to its practice? If the Empire were to build such a thing, he would be enthusiastic about extending his patronage. Provided that the focus was on the healing and beneficial magics of Spring, and not on [[Spring magic#Chaos|corruption]], [[Spring magic#Ruinous|ruin]], or [[Spring magic#Savagery|savagery]]. Indeed, were the Conclave to make a formal approach to him via a declaration of [[Concord]], he would be prepared to encourage his gentle friends to share their proposals for where and how such a place might be constructed.
### Fighting is Enough
There is also love in the world, and there are no thinking creatures who do not feel it. When the stillness creeps in and quiets the thunder of hate and fear, even the Druj can hope.
Ossegrahn is not a fool; he knows that sometimes it is necessary to fight. Yet as his Creed demonstrates, he views violence as the last resort when all other acceptable options are exhausted. Ideally, he would like the Empire to disband all its [[Imperial army|armies]] and use the resources they free up to build [[Fortifications|defences]] instead, as they do in the [[Mountains of the Moon]]. More realistically, he urges anyone who wishes to make the world a better place to prevail on their allies in the [[Imperial Military Council]] to do least harm. Strategies that intentionally kill people, whether they are enemies or even one's own people, are anathema to Ossegrahn - and he argues should disgust any civilised person. "''If you are forced to fight, do it for the right reasons and in the right way,''" his heralds say. One way to make war a tiny bit less awful would be to ensure every territory where Imperial troops fight is protected by the [[Rivers of Life]]. Sometimes this isn't possible, because Imperial magicians cannot reach a suitably potent regio, but if the Conclave were to make a clear statement that the preservation of life is more important than slaughter, he might be able to find ways to help magicians find such regio so that they can preserve life even of their foes.
