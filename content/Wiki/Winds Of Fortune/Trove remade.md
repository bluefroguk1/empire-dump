Punam dropped down the side of the bank into the ditch. There was a figure in the bushes that she could just make out in the twilight.  Grasping her staff firmly she stalked toWards the figure. It was no orc by the silhouette - its [[Cambion]] horns were unmistakable in the half light.
“Comac?” She said hesitantly.  The cambion turned round and grinned. His bow in one hand and a half eaten rabbit’s leg in the other.  He offered it to her, but she shook her head.
“Nice staff,” He said.  “You didn’t have that when I saw you in Ateri”
She smiled back at him.  “We had a shipment.”  She indicated her silk mantle.  She had been reluctant to [[Fight]] alongside the [[Navarr]], but apart from the lack of respect for personal space and their tendency to overshare, they were a lot friendlier than she had expected.
“You’re lucky.  You have no idea what I had to do just to get a bottle of ale. The Military Council must favour you, I can’t remember the last time we had anything nice delivered."
He grinned and finished eating the rabbit, throwing the bone over his shoulder.
Punam wondered how nice it must be to live so carefree. She had spent the last three evenings practicing with the other Sentinels. The Cyclic [[Cyclic magic]] wasn’t versatile, and they would need to master six different sets of tactics if they were to get best use out of the equipment they had been given. 
She actually enjoyed the problem solving involved, although fighting during the day and theorising at night was taking it toll on her, leaving her tired and aching when she finally collapsed into bed.
“You don’t still have that bottle of ale?” she said.
The cambion grinned, pUlling out a small leather wrapped bottle.
“Swap you for your [[Mage]] staff?”  He said, laughing as he passed it over. Punam accepted it and poured some of the bottle into a small silver cup before passing it back.
“No, but I’ll buy you a pint when we get out of [[Spiral]], I have a feeling that I won’t be getting a rest any time soon.”
## Overview
The trove of mage weapons and armour discovered in the vaulted chamber underneath the Ruins of the Unmade [[Spire]] in [[Redoubt]] has been used to equip the [[Citadel Guard]].
The [[Senator]] for Redoubt, Probus of the Shattered Spire, provided a significant amount of [[Ilium]] that has been used to imbue the weapons and armour with a potent [[Magic]] that causes them to resonate in harmony with the power of the six realms of magic. The power contained in the items is cyclical, following a set cycle from one [[Realm]] to the next as the power shifts and reforms season by season. The prOgression follows the pattern established by the ritual [[Align the Celestial Net]]. In turn, the accoutrements resonate with the power of day, winter, spring, night, summer, autumn, and then back to day. 
With their understanding of magic, the Citadel Guard can harness and [[Empower]] themselves with potent effects that will allow the army to employ unique tactics on [[The Battlefield]].
## Significance
The Citadel Guard has improved its magic quality. It has now become the ''Cyclic Resonance'' quality. This quality is a unique advancement of its existing quality. 
As well as all the properties of the magic quality, each season the [[General]] will be able to choose whether to employ a unique order derived from resonance with one of the realms. This order reflects the potent magics the Citadel Guard can draw on during that campaign season. Unlike the mercenary quality, the general cannot select the special ability they receive. Once the cycle begins it will shift in a predictable pattern from one to the next over six seasons and then begin again. It is not possible to interrupt, reverse, delay, or skip any part of the sequence. The inclusion of the ilium in the effects, means it will not be possible to shift the cycle using Magic.
It will be up to the general of the Citadel Guard, General Nicassia Avicia of Phoenix Reach, to deterMine where the cycle will begin, and after that the cycle will turn inexorably as long as the Citadel Guard possesses the Cyclic Resonance quality.
## OOC Note
The exact properties of this advanced quality were presented to the [[Urizen]] general at the event, and were added to the wiki. Eventually, in Autumn 383YE, this quality was permanently replaced with a new, more versatile quality: [[Highest discipline]].
