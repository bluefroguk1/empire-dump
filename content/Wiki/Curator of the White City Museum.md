## Overview
This title was [[Construct_museum|established]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Summer Solstice 378YE. The White City Museum was completed shortly before the Spring Equinox 379YE.
## Responsibilities
The Curator of the White City Museum is responsible for maintaining the museum itself, and for acquiring new exhibits. Indeed, the intention was that the Curator acquire antiquities from across the Empire, establishing the White City Museum as a site of Imperial, rather than only Highborn, [[Pride]].

In addition, if anything were to threaten the good operation of the museum, it would be the responsibility of the Curator to address those problems.

## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides seven measures of [[liao]] to the Curator each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in the Synod
Curator of the White City Museum may sit in the Imperial Synod, and possesses 14 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 14 votes if they already have a [[congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly for which [[Sinecure#Synod_Votes|they are eligible]]. 

## Appointment
Curator of the White City Museum is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[judgement]] of the Highguard [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|Assembly]].

The title can be held by a Highguard citizen. The Curator has [[tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Highguard National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## White City Museum
The museum was established following the destruction of the [[Reikos#Tabernacle|Tabernacle]] Museum of Antiquities by the[[ Druj]], and many of the original parts of the collection were items recovered from the ruins by heroic Imperial action.
