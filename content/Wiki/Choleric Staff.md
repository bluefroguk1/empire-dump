## Description
The Choleric Staff  taps upon the power of the [[Summer|realm of Summer]] to maximise the potential of the bearer's ritual power. These arcane implements are employed throughout the Empire to fortify the abilities of Summer ritualists.

A Choleric Staff is often slightly shorter and heavier than other [[:Category:Ritual_Staves|ritual staves]]. In [[the Marches]], a staff of this kind is often referred to as a ''Soldier's Shillelagh'' and wielded by magicians and [[Groups#Covens|covens]] that specialise in providing warlike [[Enchantment|enchantments]]. Such staves are carved from gnarled oak branches inlaid with tempest jade and dragonbone sigils and shod in alloys of orichalcum and iron. Marcher [[Magical skills#Battle Mage|battle magicians]] or those with an [[Alder's Edge]] wield these staves to good effect on the battlefield supporting their [[yeoman of the Marches|yeoman]] allies.

It is common to see such an implement engraved with the [[Runes#Runes_of_Summer|runes of Summer]] or with depictions of constellations such as [[the Oak]], [[the Mountain]] or [[the Stallion]]. A ''Staff of Summer Stars'', as it is also known, is a favourite with [[Urizen]] and [[Dawn|Dawnish]] ritual magicians who specialise in the higher magnitude rituals such as [[Mantle of Lordly Might]] or [[Glory to the Sovereign]]. 

Making an [[Ilium#Creating_Artefacts|artefact]] version of the Choleric Staff is a costly endeavour, but there are a handful of such items in the Empire. They are usually passed down from magician to magician within a single coven. One of the best known is the ''Staff of the Noonday Sun'', crafted in 172YE by Karina Matrinova Vos, a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Varushka magical traditions#Volhov|volhov]] from [[Karov]] who used it to allow herself to perform [[Chasuble of Majesty]] by herself in the wilderness, as part of her self-appointed role as a defender and pilgrim of [[the Way]]. The staff has been passed from magician to magician ever since, usually within the [[Conclave order]] of the [[Sevenfold Path]], and is said to strongly influence its wielder toward hunting and destroying cults dedicated to heretical virtues.

### Archmage Staff
The [[Archmage#Staff_of_the_Archmage|staff]] of the [[Archmage]] of Summer is a version of the Choleric Staff crafted to a secret pattern, and grants twice as much power to the wielder. Unlike most such staves, the same physical staves are reforged each year; some of the staves are believed to have developed spontaneous auras as a consequence, and blamed for a certain “gung ho” attitude among the archmages of Summer.
