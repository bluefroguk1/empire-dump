## Overview
The world of Empire is known to touch six other planes of existence that are separate from, but intimately connected to, the mortal [[Realm|realm]]. These [[Realms|realms]] are innately connected to the practice of [[Magic|magic]], as well as being home to magical entities called eternals.
Magicians have named four of the realms after seasons, but these are symbolic rather than literal names. The [[Realm]] of [[Winter]], for example, incorporates brutal desert, parched forests and bottomless oceans as well as frozen snowfields. The "seasonal realms" resonate more with the "seasons of life" than the literal wheel of the seasons. [[Spring]] is wild and unfettered as a child, [[Summer]] is full of the arrogance of youth, [[Autumn]] is a [[Realm|realm]] of maturity, and Winter a [[Realm|realm]] echoing with the fear and [[Wisdom|wisdom]] of old age. By contrast, [[Day]] and [[Night]] are realms of the spirit; one encompasses ideas of intellect and the higher mind, the other ideas of passion and the primal instincts.
Humans cannot survive in the realms themselves. Mortals who claim to have visited a [[Realm|realm]] have in fact visited a chamber - a place that exists part way between the mundane world and the realm. Some of these chambers are very large - one might contain an entire [[Forest|forest]] for example.
### The Realm Glyphs
A system of six sigils are commonly used in [[The Empire|the Empire]] to represent the realms. These sigils were created and popularised in pre-Imperial times by a Dawnish [[Enchanter|enchanter]], initially for use in heraldry. They were later adopted by several prominent [[Weaver|weaver]] cabals for the creation of [[Magic|magic]] banners, tabards and cloaks and their use slowly spread, especially in [[Varushka]], [[The League]] and [[Highguard]]. Today they are regularly used in [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magic|magic]] as symbols of entire realms where individual [[Wintermark]] [[Runes]] would be too specific or too laden with additional meaning. Many eternals recognise these glyphs, and honour their association.
## Spring

Sometimes called the Primal [[Forest]], this is a realm overflowing with life in infinite variety. A realm where things begin and are renewed second to second, but where death comes swiftly. Here the green eternals celebrate creation and destruction in all its untold beauty, and buzzing voices remind humankind that it has no place here in the primeval realm.
## Summer

In the realm of might and majesty, everything exists in a timeless moment at its idealised prime. Great oaks tower over [[The Fields of Glory|the fields of glory]], the mountains scrape the skies, the blizzards howl more terrible than any mortal storm and the dark sea is deeper than any mortal ocean. The savage beasts of legend are hunted across the rolling plains by eternals clad in the bright panoply of youth and immortality.
## Autumn

In the realm of intrigue and influence, everything interweaves in a great shifting web of favour and debt. The horned lords and ladies compete in savage games of wealth and power. They welcome mortals to their councils but beware the bargains of Autumn for, in the labyrinth, nothing is simple.
## Winter

The Wasteland is hungry. It is a realm of creaking dread, of fear and famine without the memory of dusk or the hope of [[Dawn|dawn]]. From the parching heat of the dusty desert halls to the frigid silence of snow-drowned forests wait the eternals of Winter, the wise monsters who make no effort to conceal their cruel natures. It is a realm of [[Wisdom|wisdom]], the cruel [[Wisdom|wisdom]] that comes with age and experience, the [[Wisdom|wisdom]] of hard choices and the certainty of death.
## Day

A realm of spirit and of shining light. Where the sky and the ocean meet, in the heights and the depths, the eternals of Day seek infinite understanding of the truths of creation. It is a realm that celebrates reason over impulse, thought over instinct, harmony over passion. It is the realm of the higher mind, of the birth of revelation and the death of secrets.
## Night

A realm of spirit and of [[Eternal|eternal]] shadow. Where passion rules, thought gives way to instinct, and joy and terror are both a breath away. The coiling serpents and enigmatic wyrms of Night whisper of the joy of mysteries, and of the riddles whose beauty lies in the act of unravelling rather than the revelation of the secrets wrapped within.
