### [[The Law]]
Things Live.
### The [[Constellation]]
[[The Fountain]] is a constellation of nine stars that rises from the horizon in early [[Spring|spring]], reaches its [[Zenith|zenith]] as spring turns to [[Summer|summer]] and vanishes below the horizon during the [[Winter|winter]] months. 
### Symbolism
Water is life, and [[The Fountain|the Fountain]] is the bringer of life, the herald of birth and fertility. In [[Highguard]] conception under [[The Fountain|the Fountain]] is deemed to be especially auspicious; in [[Urizen]] the constellation is often [[Painted|painted]] onto the ceiling of maternity chambers. It also stands as an emblem of beginnings; as the Wellspring it represents the place you originate, your source, your first cause and principle. In some parts of [[Varushka]] it is instead called the Tree of Ice; this imagery being especially popular among [[Draughir|draughir]]. 
### Invoking [[The Fountain|the Fountain]] in [[Magic]]
[[The Fountain]] is nature tamed; a source and wellspring of life and fertility. [[Rituals]] seeking growth, bounty or fertility all benefit from the auspices of the Fountain. A curious lesser-known efficacy of the Fountain in [[Magic|magic]] is to do with origins, sources and wellsprings; the places things come from, their [[History|history]] and identity. The [[Ritual|ritual]] to create a national [[Egregore|egregore]] uses some imagery of the Fountain. 
### Tulpas of the Fountain
Tulpas of the Fountain appear much more benign than many; the Lady of the Waters is one well known to the Dawnish, a woman who comes from the lake to assist with childbirth then leaves, having said nothing and refusing any payment for her work. A curious [[Tulpa|tulpa]] of the Fountain is the [[Archivist]], a pale, bloodless tall man who appears to the inhabitants of [[Highguard]]â€™s [[Necropolis|necropolis]] bearing secrets no mortal could possibly know. 
### [[Alignment]]
The Fountain is a profoundly benign force and ritualists who touch it in ritual find themselves overwhelmed with life, growth and the natural flow of the world; it can be hard to maintain focus as one is distracted by the verdance of the grass, the dance of the mayflies and the joy of the people around you. The effect can be quite narcotic and not entirely dissimilar to the behaviour of those on recreational drugs.
