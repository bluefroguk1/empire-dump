## Motto
''Power begets wealth; wealth begets Power''
## The Manifesto
The Order of the [[Golden Pyramid]] holds the following to be true:
* [[Magic]] is a commodity like any other and its practitioners should not be subjected to any undue expectation or requirement
* The talents of [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s artisans are no less a valuable magical [[Resource|resource]] than [[Spellcasting|spellcasting]] and [[Rituals|rituals]]
* [[Magic]] has the power to strengthen by enriching and prospering
The Order of the [[Golden Pyramid]] therefore exists to:
* Stand up for those magicians who are pressured to use their [[Skills|skills]] for free, like a servant or slave
* Support the application of magical resources in matters of economic gain that inevitably bring [[Prosperity|prosperity]] to [[The Empire|the Empire]] as a whole
* Stand up for the artisans and promote their interests across [[The Empire|the Empire]]
## Symbol
The most popular symbol symbol of the order is step-pyramid of three levels with bronze at the bottom, silver in the middle, and gold at the top.
## Membership of the Order
This [[Golden Pyramid]] appeals to artisan-magicians and magicians versed in economic [[Magic|magic]] (from [[Rampant Growth]] and [[Blood and Salt]] through [[Rivers of Gold]] [[All the way|all the way]] to [[Verdant Bounty of the Twilight Bayou]] and [[Hallow of the Green World]]). After the [[Sevenfold Path]] this is the order that has the largest number of [[Magician|magician]]-priests, albeit usually priests dedicated to [[Prosperity]]. Its members work to enrich themselves, but they also safeguard the rights of magicians to expect fair recompense for their [[Magic|magic]]. They are often at odds with the [[Rod and Shield]].
The Order of the [[Golden Pyramid]] began as a reaction against a perceived culture of entitlement; as [[The Nations|the nations]] increasingly assumed that magicians should donate their [[Skills|skills]] to [[The Empire|the Empire]] for free. Since their creation many members have supported the right of artisans, as well as magicians, to have a voice in [[The Conclave|the Conclave]]; but this attitude is far from universal within the Order. At its most altruistic, the Order tries to represent the interests of artisans as fellow practitioners of esoteric lore, and often approaches them for support and funding.
As befits an order fascinated by wealth, members of the Order often strive to cultivate good relations with the [[Imperial Bourse]] and magicians who also occupy [[Bourse]] seats are often actively wooed by the [[Golden Pyramid]]. When it works well, this relationship gives the Golden Pyramid access to the wealth of [[The Bourse|the Bourse]] on behalf of other members of the [[Conclave]], and the Pyramid has been adroit at using this access for political capital. Even when their influence in the Bourse is limited, the Golden Pyramid has a tradition of encouraging the performance of economic [[Rituals|rituals]] to garner support or influence with Imperial citizens who own businesses, mines, forests, fleets, and mercenary warbands.
Members of the Golden Pyramid traditionally consider it completely acceptable, even expected, for their [[Grandmaster]] to gain their position by open bribery. It is also common for the [[Grandmaster|grandmaster]] to take advantage of their access to wealthy patrons to help fund the order.
## [[Conclave vault]]
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Golden Pyramid garners a pro rata share of the [[Font]] based on the precedence of the orders at the previous summit; a portion of [[Ilium]] based on their position among the orders as determined by precedence; and additional [[Materials|materials]] due to outstanding bequests.
These bequests are collected by the Civil Service, and provided to the [[Grandmaster]] at the start of each summit.
* Two ingots of [[Green iron]] have come from the town of Kosti in return for support provided by the Order during the [[Thule]] invasion of [[Karsk]] in 368YE. 
* Three measures of beggar's lye have come from Little Ribston, a quiet settlement in Birchland. The bequest began in 368YE and involves [[Recognition|recognition]] of support offered to [[Emperor Walter]] during his ascent to [[The Throne|the Throne]].
* Three ingots of [[Orichalcum]] come from the Yesun [[Family|family]] of [[Faraden]], as part of a deal made in 305YE involving a [[Ritual text|ritual text]] of Revelation of the Jewel's Sparkling Heart.
* Three measures of [[Ambergelt]] have come from the Carmine Band of Regario since 206YE and [[Will|will]] continue for as long as they promote the interests of artisans across [[The Empire|the Empire]].
