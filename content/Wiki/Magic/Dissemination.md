Title: Dissemination

## Overview
While rituals that are part of [[Imperial lore]] are available to any Imperial citizen, there are circumstances where a magician might wish to share one of these rituals with someone else, or they may simply desire a ritual text for their own personal library. Doing so invariably requires the creation of a [[Formulaic ritual#Ritual Texts|ritual text]], which can be handed over to the target.
While titles such as the [[Dean of the Lyceum]] and the [[Master of Ice and Darkness]] have the ability to guide their respective [[College of Magic]] to create a ritual text, it is rarely worth recreating such an object from "scratch" - it is time consuming and potentially expensive. Instead, the Conclave can instruct the Civil Service to create a ritual text for an existing ritual that is part of [[Imperial lore]].
## Necessary Details
* The [[Declaration]] must explicitly name a single ritual that is part of [[Imperial lore|Imperial Lore]] and the citizen or group who is to receive the copy of the ritual text
A [[Declaration]] of [[Dissemination]] must name a specific ritual that is part of [[Imperial lore]]. It must also give the name of the person or group who will receive the copy of that ritual text - for example "the [[Principalities of Jarm|Jarmish]] house of [[Principalities of Jarm ports#Rigia .28Eastern Principalities of Jarm.29|Radz]]", "the [[Asavean Archipelago|Asavean ambassador]]", or "Arlen Weaver of Dawn".
## Resolution
* It costs ten thrones to create a copy of a ritual text, the proposer must put the money in their hand-in baggy at the end of the event
* Payment must be provided before the start of the next summit
* Once payment is received, the Civil Service will arrange for the creation of the ritual text and deliver it to the named recipient
Creating a ritual text through the [[Declaration]] of [[Dissemination]] requires ten thrones to pay for the codification of the ritual. (OOC: These funds should be handed in to GOD in a hand-in baggy at the end of the event. Whoever is providing payment should email plot@profounddecisions.co.uk with details of their CID and the ritual being paid for after the event to ensure there is no confusion.)
Assuming the money is provided, the Civil Service will arrange to create a copy of the ritual text and deliver it before the start of the next summit.
The ritual text becomes the sole legal property of the named person or group; it is not possible to rescind this declaration later.
