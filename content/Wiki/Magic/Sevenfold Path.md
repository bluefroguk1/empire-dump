## Motto
''Let all power be guided by virtue.''
## The Manifesto
The Order of the [[Sevenfold Path]] holds the following to be true:
* [[Magic]] should work in harmony with, and to promote, the fulfilment of the destiny of Imperial citizens.
* [[The Conclave]] and [[Synod]] can most effectively protect [[The Empire|the Empire]] from hazards, and subversive elements, by working in harmony and unison
* [[The Way]] of Virtue binds [[The Empire|the Empire]] together and should inform all use of powers, including [[Magic|magic]]
The Order of the [[Sevenfold Path]] exists to:
* Encourage use of [[Magic|magic]] in understanding, and supporting, human destiny and the destiny of orcs and other peoples.
* Ensure the powers of the [[Conclave]] are deployed in line with [[The Way|the Way]] of Virtue
* Build a bridge between the Conclave and the priests of [[The Synod|the Synod]]
Prior to the [[Spring]] Equinox 385YE, the wording of the Order's goals focused on human destiny only. [[The Senate]] amended the goals, following the request of the order itself, to make it clear that they would understand and support orcs, as well as humans.
## Symbol
A symbol that has been used by the Order in the past has been a seven-spoked wheel with each of the triangles between the spokes coloured differently with one of the colours of the rainbow.
## Membership of the Order
This is the order that contains the largest number of [[Magician|magician]]-priests, and many of its members also vote in the [[Imperial Synod]]. Some wags have dubbed the [[Sevenfold Path]] as the "''Magician's [[Assembly]]''". Even those members who do not also sit in the Synod tend to be politically active. Most members take their self-appointed task encouraging their fellow magicians to keep to [[The Way|the Way]] very seriously. At the very least, they have a great deal of interest in ensuring that the archmages and their fellow grandmasters are virtuous. With the Synod unable to revoke titles in the Conclave, the [[Sevenfold Path]] traditionally see part of their role as using the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]] and [[Declaration]] of the Balance to ensure corrupt or heretical citizens do not rise to high office in the Conclave. Likewise, they take the [[Declaration]] of [[Sorcery]] very seriously and seldom balk at using it to remove power from those they consider to be a threat to the stability of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Finally, this is the order that has historically made the most use of the [[Declaration]] of [[Interdiction]] to protect the souls of their fellow citizens from dubious [[Magic|magic]].
Devout magicians are joined in this order by magicians who genuinely seek to ensure the future of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. In recent years several [[Imperial Orcs]] have joined the order. This led some members to quietly agitate for a change to the manifesto; originally the first point mentioned ''human destiny'' rather than the ''destiny of Imperial citizens.''  Following a [[Declaration]] of [[Concord]] by the Conclave, a motion was brought before the [[Senate]] and the wording changed to recognise that not all Imperial citizens are humans. Most orc members appear unconcerned, both with the change and the original wording, although it has (perhaps predictably) outraged some traditional members of the Order. A vocal minority claim that with this change of emphasis, the Order is no longer concerned with the wider destiny of humanity but solely with the destiny of [[The Empire|the Empire]] - a narrowing of vision that could be seen at best as cowardice and at worst as betraying the original spirit of their Order.
The Order of the [[Sevenfold Path]] has traditionally chosen grandmasters who are strong in virtue and faith, usually priests. Of all the orders, the Sevenfold Path tends to have the worst access to crystal mana as many of its members are leaders of a [[Congregation]], rather than controlling a [[Mana site]]. Consequently, the order is usually more measured in the addresses and declarations raised.
One particular [[Ritual|ritual]] that often receives special attention from the Sevenfold Path is [[Mantle of the Golden Orator]]. This ritual allows the Sevenfold Path to directly aid their allies in the Synod; they know the value of giving a larger voice to those priests who speak in support of the Conclave and of magicians in [[General|general]].
## [[Conclave vault]]
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Sevenfold Path garners a pro rata share of the [[Font]] based on the precedence of the orders at the previous summit; a portion of [[Ilium]] based on their position among the orders as determined by precedence; and additional [[Materials|materials]] due to outstanding bequests.
* Two measures of beggar's lye come from the Vale of [[Burning]] Tears in thanks for breaking a sovereign's [[Curse|curse]] during the reign of [[Empress Aenea]]. 
* Three measures of [[Dragonbone]] come from the tenders of the corpse glade associated with the [[Heartwood of the Great Vale]] since 362YE. The dragonbone was unearthed when digging graves for the odd corpses found in the [[Weirwood|weirwood]] trees and according to rumour the local workers consider it to be "ill omened".
* Three measures of [[Iridescent gloaming]] come from the [[Hakima]] of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] as a gift which has been collected by the Silver Rivers [[Hakima]] since 81YE and [[Will|will]] continue to be delivered for as long as the order continues to encourage the use of [[Magic|magic]] in understanding, and supporting, human destiny.
