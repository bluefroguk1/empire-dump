## Motto
''Let all power be guided by virtue.''
## The Manifesto
The Order of the [[Sevenfold Path]] holds the following to be true:
* Magic should work in harmony with, and to promote, the fulfilment of the destiny of Imperial citizens.
* The Conclave and Synod can most effectively protect the Empire from hazards, and subversive elements, by working in harmony and unison
* The Way of Virtue binds the Empire together and should inform all use of powers, including magic
The Order of the [[Sevenfold Path]] exists to:
* Encourage use of magic in understanding, and supporting, human destiny and the destiny of orcs and other peoples.
* Ensure the powers of the Conclave are deployed in line with the Way of Virtue
* Build a bridge between the Conclave and the priests of the Synod
Prior to the Spring Equinox 385YE, the wording of the Order's goals focused on human destiny only. The Senate [[385YE Spring Equinox Senate sessions#Amend Manifesto of Sevenfold Path|amended]] the goals, following the request of the order itself, to make it clear that they would understand and support orcs, as well as humans.
## Symbol
A symbol that has been used by the Order in the past has been a seven-spoked wheel with each of the triangles between the spokes coloured differently with one of the colours of the rainbow.
## Membership of the Order
This is the order that contains the largest number of magician-priests, and many of its members also vote in the [[Imperial Synod]]. Some wags have dubbed the [[Sevenfold Path]] as the "''Magician's Assembly''". Even those members who do not also sit in the Synod tend to be politically active. Most members take their self-appointed task encouraging their fellow magicians to keep to the Way very seriously. At the very least, they have a great deal of interest in ensuring that the [[Archmage|archmages]] and their fellow [[Grandmaster|grandmasters]] are virtuous. With the Synod unable to revoke titles in the Conclave, the Sevenfold Path traditionally see part of their role as using the [[Declaration#Declaration of Candidacy|Declaration of Candidacy]] and [[Declaration#Declaration of the Balance|Declaration of the Balance]] to ensure corrupt or heretical citizens do not rise to high office in the Conclave. Likewise, they take the [[Declaration#Declaration of Sorcery|Declaration of Sorcery]] very seriously and seldom balk at using it to remove power from those they consider to be a threat to the stability of the Empire. Finally, this is the order that has historically made the most use of the [[Declaration#Declaration of Interdiction|Declaration of Interdiction]] to protect the souls of their fellow citizens from dubious magic.
Devout magicians are joined in this order by magicians who genuinely seek to ensure the future of the Empire. In recent years several [[Imperial Orcs]] have joined the order. This led some members to quietly agitate for a change to the manifesto; originally the first point mentioned ''human destiny'' rather than the ''destiny of Imperial citizens.''  Following a [[Declaration#Declaration of Concord|Declaration of Concord]] by the Conclave, a motion was brought before the Senate and the wording [[Alter manifesto of Sevenfold Path|changed]] to recognise that not all Imperial citizens are humans. Most orc members appear unconcerned, both with the change and the original wording, although it has (perhaps predictably) outraged some traditional members of the Order. A vocal minority claim that with this change of emphasis, the Order is no longer concerned with the wider destiny of humanity but solely with the destiny of the Empire - a narrowing of vision that could be seen at best as cowardice and at worst as betraying the original spirit of their Order.
The Order of the Sevenfold Path has traditionally chosen grandmasters who are strong in virtue and faith, usually priests. Of all the orders, the Sevenfold Path tends to have the worst access to crystal mana as many of its members are leaders of a [[Congregation]], rather than controlling a [[Mana site]]. Consequently, the order is usually more measured in the addresses and declarations raised.
One particular ritual that often receives special attention from the Sevenfold Path is [[Mantle of the Golden Orator]]. This ritual allows the Sevenfold Path to directly aid their allies in the Synod; they know the value of giving a larger voice to those priests who speak in support of the Conclave and of magicians in general.
## [[Conclave vault]]
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Sevenfold Path garners a pro rata share of the [[Conclave vault#Crystal Mana|Font]] based on the [[Imperial Conclave#Principle of Precedence|precedence]] of the orders at the previous summit; a portion of [[Ilium]] based on their [[Conclave vault#Ilium|position]] among the orders as determined by precedence; and additional materials due to outstanding bequests.
* Two measures of [[beggar's lye]] come from the Vale of Burning Tears in thanks for breaking a [[Varushkan Monster#Sovereigns|sovereign's]] curse during the reign of [[Empress Aenea]]. 
* Three measures of [[Dragonbone]] come from the tenders of the corpse glade associated with the [[Heartwood of the Great Vale]] since 362YE. The dragonbone was unearthed when digging graves for the odd corpses found in the weirwood trees and according to rumour the local workers consider it to be "ill omened".
* Three measures of [[Iridescent gloaming]] come from the [[Hakima]] of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] as a gift which has been collected by the Silver Rivers Hakima since 81YE and will continue to be delivered for as long as the order continues to encourage the use of magic in understanding, and supporting, human destiny.
