## Description
This spell is a potent malediction that can neutralise the most powerful enemy champion or render an [[Archmage]] as powerless as a raw recruit.The debilitation imposed by this spell is more than mere lack of strength - it is a potentially lethal [[Curse|curse]]. The victim cannot concentrate on even the simplest spell, cannot inspire themselves to heroic action and cannot use the powers of any [[Magic Items]] they are bonded to.
It is particularly insidious in that it does not go away naturally; it can be removed with [[Herbs|herbs]] by a skilled [[Physick|physick]], or purged by a [[Magician|magician]] using the [[Purify]] spell or a [[Ritual|ritual]] such as [[Renewed Strength of the New Day]]. Otherwise, it lasts indefinitely.
## Casting

The [[Weakness|weakness]] condition prevents the target from using any [[Heroic skills|heroic skills]], using any mana, or activating any enchantments or [[Magic]] Items that are not "always on".
You must assume that the target has taken the effect.
The effect lasts until cured by the [[Purify]] spell, or a similar [[Potion|potion]] or [[Magic|magic]].
