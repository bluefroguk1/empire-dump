## Description
This spell is a potent malediction that can neutralise the most powerful enemy champion or render an [[Archmage]] as powerless as a raw recruit.The debilitation imposed by this spell is more than mere lack of strength - it is a potentially lethal [[Curse]]. The victim cannot concentrate on even the simplest spell, cannot inSpire themselves to heroic action and cannot use the powers of any [[Magic Items]] they are bonded to.
It is particularly insidious in that it does not go away naturally; it can be removed with herbs by a skilled physick, or purged by a magician using the [[Purify]] spell or a ritual such as [[Renewed Strength of the New Day]]. Otherwise, it lasts indefinitely.
## Casting
Offensive Spell|1
## Effects
You may call [[Weakness]] against the target struck by your implement.
The weakness condition prEvents the target from using any Heroic [[Heroic skills]], using any mana, or activating any Enchantments or [[Magic]] Items that are not "always on".
You must assume that the target has taken the effect.
The effect lasts until cured by the Purify spell, or a similar [[Potion]] or magic.

* [[Astronomancy]]: [[The Drowned Man]], the astronomantic constellation associated with endings and with curses, is commonly invoked with the weakness spell.
