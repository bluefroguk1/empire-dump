### The Law
Things Hold Together
### The Constellation
[[The Chain]] is comprised of five stars with the brightest at either end. It is unique in that it appears to rotate about itself, with the star to the extreme right always appearing in a fixed point due north. This particular star is often referred to as ‘The Anchor’ by mariners and the remainder of the constellation as ‘The Ship’s Chain’.
### Symbolism
The Chain has deep symbolism to the [[Imperial Orcs]]: they hold this constellation as particularly important, calling the two end stars as ‘The Manacles’. They see it as a reflection of their past history and a symbol of their steadfast [[Loyalty]] to [[The Empire]]. Ever-present and immobile. It also stands as a symbol of service – service to a cause, service to an ideal or to a tradition. This is not about loyalties of [[Family]] or clan – that is [[The Three Sisters]]. This is about being willingly bound to a cause not your own; choosing to make a stand.
The Chain also stands for those things which make us what we are – the ties which bind. Objects of great personal significance, or character defining moments, all stand under the stars of the Chain.
### Invoking the Chain in Ritual
The most obvious place to use The Chain is in binding Rituals – but it is also often used to mark the taking of oaths and swearing of allegiances. Ritualists often use literal chain to mark it – though ritualists with orc participants in their groups are adVised to keep in mind the cultural sensitivities involved in waving manacles about, even in the interests of Magical synthesis.
### Tulpas of The Chain
The King-in-Chains is a famous tulpa of The Chain – a royal figure in tattered and shredded robes all bedraped in chains; scholars of the Eternals look askance at this, pointing to the Bound King of [[The Thrice-cursed Court]] and the sinister associations he bears. Tulpas of the Chain often appear with chains or ropes tightly bound about their bodies – they are believed to play a great part in the supernatural punishment of oathbreakers. Among the orcs it’s said Baraka of the Manacles waits for those who betray their sworn word to clap them back in irons for eternity.
### [[Alignment]]
Coming close to the Chain instils a strong sense of the importance of oaths, the sworn word and the promises we each make one to another. Ritualists in such a state will take very seriously any attempt to lie or dissemble to them and will often be very driven to swear powerful oaths for things that matter to them.
