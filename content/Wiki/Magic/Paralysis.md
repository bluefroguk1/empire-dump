## Description
This potent martial [[Magic|magic]] renders an enemy defenceless for a short period of time - usually more than enough time to either dispatch or capture them. Like the [[Repel]] spell, it employs magical force; in this case to restrain the target's entire body. This is sometimes described as akin to being held by a massive, invisible hand or being wrapped from head to foot in loose [[Bands|bands]] of unseen power that tighten instantly to prevent any movement. Some targets, however, have described the experience more as a metaphorical force - a dominating power that makes it impossible for them to even think about moving their bodies for a short time.
When the spell takes hold it is a rare enemy who has the ability to survive the follow-up attacks of the [[Magician|magician]] and their allies.
Any magician who plans to take [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] can supplement their magical abilities with a [[Quiet Word]] rod, while more dedicated [[War|war]] wizards can appreciate the value of a [[Shadowbound Donjon]] staff. The [[Caress of Arhallogen]] is a powerful staff that allows multiple additional uses of this spell each [[Day|day]], as well as granting abilities to wield supernatural [[Venom]] against enemies, although its connection to the [[Eternal]] [[Arhallogen]] has given it something of a dark reputation.
Of particular interest to a magician who masters this devastating spell is the [[Sceptre of the Necropolis]], a powerful rod that gives the wielder a limited ability to use their spell to critically injure their target by stilling processes vital to life rather than immobilising their bodies.
## Casting
Offensive Spell|2
## Effects
You may call PARALYSE against the target struck by your implement.
[[Paralysis]] holds the target in place with magical force for ten seconds. They can talk or drink a [[Potion|potion]] if they are fed one, but they cannot move or take any other actions. 
If the target blocks or parries your strike they are not paralysed.
## Sample [[Spellcasting]] Vocals
* (''Slashing an implement in a swift arc'') "Feel the weight of [[The Mountain|the mountain]] - PARALYSE!"
* "I command you with [[Hirmok]]'s control, be still - PARALYSE!"
* "The light of [[Ophis]] stun you with its brilliance - PARALYSE!"
* "Be bound as the Chained Man - PARALYSE!"
* "In [[The Spider|the Spider]]-King's name, I bind you with [[Magic|magic]] - PARALYSE!"
## Common Elements
* [[Rune]] [[Magic]]: The rune [[Hirmok]], which signifies control and domination, is strongly connected with this spell, although some magicians favour [[Kyrop]], the rune of [[Weakness|weakness]]. In both cases, a magician might sketch the rune in the air with their implement just prior to striking with it.
* [[Astronomancy]]: An astronomancer might evoke the power of [[The Mountain]] with this spell - its resonance can be used to impart immobility to a victim as easily as it can be evoked to grant strength and endurance. The [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Lock]] can be evoked in a similar way - the [[Paralysis|paralysis]] spell binds the target, or "wards" them against movement. The [[Tulpa|tulpa]] of the Chained Man is sometimes referenced with this spell. 
* [[Dramaturgy]]: A dramaturgist might take on the commanding mien of [[The Bishop]] or [[The Prince]] and instruct the target to remain where they are. less commonly, [[The Doctor]] might be employed to remove the facility of movement from an opponent "for their own good", or by using that role's superior knowledge of anatomy to restrict movement. [[The Throne|The throne]] of [[The Tomb]] is also a common reference, especially when drawing a connection between the immobility created by [[Magic|magic]] and the immobility of the dead body bound within a grave.
* Other traditions: A Dawnish [[Witch|witch]] might echo the terrifying roar of the chimera when casting this spell. Some magicians also like to call on the power of an [[Eternal|eternal]] such as [[Arhallogen]] or [[Kimus]] when striking with this spell.
* [[Realms]]: The ability to immobilise someone with magical force resonates strongly with the [[Realm|realm]] of Day. Some magicians point to the powerlessness this spell creates as showing clear sympathy with the [[Realm|realm]] of [[Winter]]. A few magicians shrug and point to [[Arhallogen]] and similar poisonous creatures and calmly claim that this spell is a manifestation of the power of [[Spring]].
