## Description
This powerful spell quickly repairs an item that has been damaged by a shattering force. It is especially useful for repairing shields that have been rendered useless by a [[Shatter]] spell, or a strike from a powerful magical weapon. The majority of the damaged item must be present, but at the completion of the spell the item is repaired seamlessly as if it had never been shattered. Some magicians believe that every piece of a broken item "remembers" having once been part of a greater whole, and that this principle guides the [[Magic|magic]] they use.
This spell is equally effective on magical and non-[[Magical Items|magical items]]; even an artefact can be fully restored. A [[Magical Item|magical item]] repaired with the [[Mend|mend]] spell retains all its special properties (although obviously any restricted abilities that have been expended are still used up).
Useful as this spell is, it is difficult to cast in the middle of a [[Fight|fight]]. The [[Magician|magician]] needs several moments of completely uninterrupted focus on the target item - which is next to impossible if it is being jerked around during a [[Fight|fight]], or if the magician themselves is in danger of being struck. To use [[Mend|mend]] effectively, the magician usually needs to be behind allied lines - or well protected by their companions while they concentrate on repairing the item. This can be made easier with the use of [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Smooth Hands Shape The World]], an [[Enchantment]] that can make magically repairing a damaged item nearly instantaneous.
Some magicians who master this spell wait in a safe location with the express intention of repairing damaged magical items when their allies return. These magicians often spend extra time casting the spell, or may make use of props such as a small hammer or a forge to enhance their casting of their [[Ritual|ritual]].
Many in [[The Empire|the Empire]] sees extra value in this spell; while spells such as [[Heal]] or [[Purify]] are powerful, their effects can be duplicated by [[Physick|physick]]. Swiftly repairing a damaged item, especially a magical item, is possible only through this spell, an artisan applying Artisan's Oil, or more expensive and time-consuming ritual [[Magic|magic]] such as [[The Anvil of Estavus]]. A magician who wants to specialise in this spell may find a [[Redsteel Chisel]] wand especially useful.
### OOC Note
There is an obvious limitation on this spell which is that it cannot be used on items that have been physically damaged in the real world. If a letter has been torn up or a bottle has been smashed, no amount of IC [[Magic|magic]] can restore the destroyed phys-rep.
## Casting
Regular Spell|1
## Effects
This spell repairs an item, such as a weapon or shield that has been broken using the [[Shatter|SHATTER]] call.
## Sample [[Spellcasting]] Vocals
* I take this broken weapon / To its [[Weakness|weakness]], my strength lend / I draw the parts together / What is broken shall now [[Mend|mend]].
* (''tracing [[Runes|runes]] on a broken weapon'') I invoke [[Pallas]]! Weapon, remember what you are! I invoke [[Hirmok]]! Weapon, heed your master! By the secrets of hammer and [[Anvil|anvil]] I forge you anew; by the words of creation I bid you be whole. 
* (''placing wand on item'') Things endure, tall beneath the stars. Things last through seasons beyond number. Strong in root and branch, standing below as Our Good Oak stands above, this blade shall not be so lightly cast aside! 
* (''striking item rhythmically'') [[War]]-drums beat, bold hearts pound, soldiers march to [[Glory|glory]]’s sound. Hammers smite, burn forge-fires bright, be forged anew by [[Summer]]’s might! 
## Common Elements
* [[Rune]] [[Magic]]: The nature of the target item might suggest a specific rune to use, but the most common is [[Pallas]], the rune of wealth; the rune can also be a timely reminder to a magician to request recompense for their use of [[Magic|magic]]. Some [[Mystics|mystics]] favour the run of transformation, changing a damaged object into a wholesome object.
* [[Astronomancy]]: In a similar way that an astronomancer might look to [[The Chalice]] when performing magical healing, bringing together the broken parts of an item and restoring their integrity has a strong connection to that [[Constellation|constellation]]. When working specifically with wooden items - especially shields or hafted weapons - an astronomancer may look to the strength and growth characterised by [[The Oak]].
* [[Dramaturgy]]: A dramaturgist might take on the role of [[The Mountebank]], performing a miraculous restoration and transforming a useless item into a fully repaired one. It is traditional when using the [[Mountebank|mountebank]] to conceal the target item in some way, perhaps beneath a cloak. [[The Captain]] is also a good fit for this spell, especially when repairing a weapon or shield.
* Other traditions: Obviously, phrases and actions related to crafting are very appropriate with this spell. A Marcher magician in particular might pack soft earth or mud around the pieces of a broken weapon or shield as they cast the spell. 
* [[Realms]]: The [[Realm|realm]] of [[Autumn]] most closely allies with the [[Mend|mend]] spell; objects, especially valuable objects, and the idea of craftsmanship are both strong themes. Summer is a close second, especially around ideas of restoring strength or integrity or "reforging" a broken item. [[Winter]] is a very poor fit indeed - it is next to impossible to use [[Winter magic]] to repair something; it is much more suited to breaking the item in the first place.
