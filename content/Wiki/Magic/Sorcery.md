## Overview
The [[Imperial Conclave]] is charged by the Constitution to "''identify those arcane practitioners whose arts work against [[The Empire]], so that they may be condemned''." One of the primary tools they use to do this is the [[Declaration]] of [[Sorcery]]. Naming an Imperial magician to be a sorcerer prohibits them from performing ritual [[Magic]], and engaging with Eternals.
The most common reason for this declaration is an abuse of magic by misuse of Curses against citizens or allies of the Empire, or against those who insist on dealing with malign entities that may threaten the Empire (such as eternals under enmity). The magistrates maintain a list of those who are declared sorcerers, carefUlly monitoring them and prosecuting them severely if they are found to have broken the restrictions on their behaviour. 
The Declaration of Sorcery can also be used to declare that someone is ''Reconciled'' with the Conclave - that they are no longer considered a threat to the Empire. 
The [[Imperial Senate]] has twice aMended the restrictions placed on a sorcerer since the death of [[Empress Britta]]. During the Spring Equinox 378YE, the Imperial Senate voted to add a prohibition against interaction with eternals and their heralds to the declaration. During the Summer Solstice 380YE, the definition was  further expanded to preclude possession of certain items that allowed ritual magic to be performed. However it is not possible for a declared sorcerer to be prohibited from carrying mana, nor from full participation in the Conclave, or holding any [[Imperial Title]].
The [[Witness of Conclave]] is Empowered to raise a Declaration of Sorcery once each summit.
## Necessary Details
* The Declaration must explicitly name one or more inhabitants of the Empire
The Declaration must name each specific inhabitant of The Empire who will be covered. Where possible it should include any appellation that might help to identify them - for example ''Apulian of the Torn Rope, Mazarin of Tamar's Hold, Elayne - Butcher of [[Astolat]] - de Hubert''. It must clEarly state whether all the named citizens are condemned as sorcerers, or whether they are all to be reconciled with the Conclave. Where possible, it is usually helpful to include a ''short'' one or two sentence explanation of why these individuals are condemned, or reconciled, so that that may be recorded for posterity alongside the outcome of the Declaration.
If there are multiple names on the Declaration, then members of the Conclave must either vote for or against the entire list - they may not split their votes. Given the severity of the [[Sanctions]] placed on sorcerers, it is considered incumbent on the Conclave to be certain ''everyone'' named on a Declaration are guilty, lest an innocent magician be persecuted for reasons of convenience.
It is ''not'' possible to name a group, such as a coven or sodality, and declare all of them to be sorcerers. Often, investigation is required to deterMine the names of the magicians involved specifically so a Declaration of Sorcery can be raised against them.
## Resolution
### Sorcery
* All the named individuals are declared to be sorcerers at the end of that [[Conclave session]]
* A sorcerer is prohibited from casting any [[Rituals]]
* They cannot carry or use magical items and [[Materials]] whose primary purpose is to aid the performance of rituals
* They cannot deal with eternals or heralds
If this declaration is made, the resolution comes into effect at the end of the Conclave session. The sorcerer is subject to three prohibitions:
* They are prohibited from performing or contributing to rituals.
* They are prohibited from carrying or using ritual staves, foci, coven stones, [[Vis]], Potions whose primary purpose is to aid or enhance the performance of rituals, and other items that exist that substantially improve the ability to perform rituals. The regalia of an [[Archmage]] are not covered by this restriction. This prohibition was added by the Imperial Senate in 378YE. The initial amendment stipulated that all such items would be given over to control of the Conclave, which was based on an earlier interpretation of Sorcery. What happens to any illegal items is a matter for the magistrates.
* They are prohibited from knowingly interacting with eternals or their heralds. This prohibition was added by the Imperial Senate in Summer 380YE.
There are many things a Declaration of Sorcery does not prohibit, including all of the following:
* Casting spells
* Owning mana crystals or using them for any reason other than to perform Rituals
* Being the target of a ritual
* Holding an Imperial title
* Voting and speaking in Conclave if nominated
The magistrates maintain a public list of sorcerers, and keep a careful eye on them and their behaviour. A sorcerer who violates one of the prohibitions placed on them is subject to arrest and trial, with the most likely punishment for someone found guilty of breaking one of these provisions is execution.
### Reconciliation
* All the named individuals cease to be sorcerers at the end of that Conclave session
If this Declaration passes, the named individuals are no longer sorcerers. All prohibitions on their behaviour are removed - it is not possible to remove some of the prohibitions. The magistrates are informed, and adjust their records accordingly. As with the declaration that someone is a sorcerer, the reconciliation comes into effect at the end of the Conclave session.
## Prominent Sorcerers
### Active Sorcerers
These individuals are believed to be active at [[Anvil]]. Any evidence that they have broken the prohibitions placed on sorcerers should be brought before the magistrates as soon as possibly.

## Constitutional Note
The power of the Conclave to declare a citizen to be a sorcerer and thereby strip them of the rights to perform ritual magic is considered deeply significant by the Constitutional Court - comparable to the power of the [[Imperial Synod]] to excommunicate a citizen. At the start of 381YE, the Constitutional Court issued a clarification on the matter of Sorcery, stating that it was unconstitutional to prohibit a citizen from carrying mana - since this would undermine their constitutionally protected rights to [[Prosperity]] and dignity. The Constitution grants the Conclave the ability to put limits on the ability of citizens to perform significant magic - not what wealth they may carry on their person. All Imperial magicians are able to take part in the Conclave; sorcerers may raise declarations (if they are able to), pay mana to speak (if recognised by a [[Grandmaster]]), or even hold an Imperial title if they can persuade their peers to support them. The previous rulings were errors associated with the reign of [[Emperor Nicovar]] and have been corrected.
