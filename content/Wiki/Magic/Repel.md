Title: Repel
---
## Description
This spell uses magical force to drive a target away from the magician. It has both defensive and an offensive functions. A [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] can use it against an attacker to help effect an expeditious retreat; to split up an enemy group or formation; or to temporarily neutralise an enemy magician. When the spell's power fades the target is usually quite some distance from their original position, meaning that even after the magical effect ends the target still needs to waste time recovering to their previous position.
The magical force unleashed by this spell is invisible and soundless, but irresistible. While some magicians make a point of performing massive, heroic strikes with their [[Weapons & Armour#Implements|implement]], the spell is just as effective when delivered with a light brush. Theoretical magicians believe that the spell draws additional force from another place - perhaps the raging tempest of Spring, the mighty winds of Summer or the irresistible energies of Day.
Several [[Magic Items|crafted implements]] exist that grant additional access to repelling magic, such as the [[Tumultuous Gyre]] rod which allows a [[Magical skills#Battle Mage|battle mage]] to strike two targets with one casting of the spell. Of particular interest to magicians who master the [[Repel|repel]] incantation is the [[Witches' Hammer]], a [[Weapons & Armour#Rods|rod]] that allows the wielder a limited ability to unleash all the energy of the spell in a single concentrated burst that can [[Calls#SHATTER|ruin]] weapons and shields; and the [[Furrowed Wake]], a [[Weapons & Armour#Staffs|staff]] that allows a magician to focus the energy of the spell [[Calls#STRIKEDOWN|send their foe sprawling]] rather than driving them away - leaving them easy pickings for the spellcaster and their allies.
## Casting
Offensive Spell|1
## Effects
You may call [[Calls#REPEL|REPEL]] against the target struck by your [[Weapons & Armour#Implements|implement]].
[[Repel]] uses a magical force to drive the target away from the caster. They must move away at a brisk walk or faster for ten seconds or until they have retreated at least 20'. If they cannot move away from the caster due to the presence of an obstacle, they must move as far as they can and then be pressed against the obstacle for the remainder of the ten second duration. While pressed against the obstacle they may talk but may take no other actions including blocking with a shield or parrying a blow. 
The target is repelled even if they parry your blow with a weapon or shield.
## Sample Spellcasting Vocals
* You shall reap the whirlwind - [[Repel|REPEL]]!
* Kimus sees you, she knows your name - REPEL!

* (''quickly sketching [[The Mountain|the Mountain]] in the air'') Things are hard - too hard! - REPEL!
* Where I and my kin stand, that's our land: now piss off! - REPEL!
* May the dust of Erigo REPEL you! Suggested by Ellen Lavery
## Common Elements
* Rune Magic: The dangerous [[Runes|Rune]] of Storms, [[Mawrig]]. is used by some runecasters, who often slash their implement through the air quickly three times before unleashing their spell. The rune of might, [[Verys]], can represent irresistible strength, while some magicians favour [[Queros]], the Rune of Plots, which can represent harnessed energy.
* [[Astronomancy]]: An [[Astronomancy|astronomancer]] might swiftly sketch the constellation of [[The Great Wyrm]] in the air before unleashing the force of this spell, or sketch the arch of [[The Mountain]] before sending the target "''tumbling down [[The Mountain|the mountain]]''".
* [[Dramaturgy]]: A [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgist]] may take on the commanding mien of [[The Captain]] or the authoritative demeanour of [[The Prince]] before unleashing this spell. [[The Mountebank]] has a particular affinity for this spell, representing as it does principles of motion, unleashed primal forces, and the kind of displacement that leads to confusion.
* Other traditions: A [[Dawn|Dawnish]] witch might evoke the thundering charge of the mythical [[Legendary beasts#Unicorn|unicorn]], or the echoing roar of the mighty [[Legendary beasts#Chimera|chimera]] when casting this spell. A more devout magician might evoke the name of [[Inga Tarn]], while an incantation referencing [[Kimus]] or [[Cathan Canae]] is also appropriate.
* Realms: Driving or hurling an enemy away has resonance with the [[Realm|realm]] of Summer, while themes of magical force have an affinity with the [[Realm|realm]] of Day.
