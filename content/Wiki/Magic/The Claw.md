### [[The Law]]
Things Bleed.
### The [[Constellation]]
[[The Claw]] is a constellation of four stars visible all year round. It spends most of the [[Autumn|autumn]] and [[Winter|winter]] months relatively close to the western horizon only rising to its peak (roughly halfway to [[Zenith|zenith]]) during mid-[[Spring|spring]]. The brightest of the four stars (the second of the four as you look left and right) is located almost directly above the tail of [[The Stork]].
### Symbolism
[[The Claw]] is perceived as representing natural [[Law|law]]; things struggle, things die, nature is red in tooth and claw. Where [[The Claw|the Claw]] strikes, blood is shed; sometimes this is part of the natural order of things and sometimes it is the outcome of violence. Equally though, [[The Claw|the Claw]] can represent struggle against the odds or defiance of what seems a foregone conclusion; even confronted with armed and armoured hunters, the mother bear [[Will|will]] [[Fight|fight]] to the death for her cubs. 
In [[Wintermark]] [[The Claw|the Claw]] is sometimes known as ''the Tusk'' especially among the [[Suaq]] - there is an old folktale of One-Tusk the walrus, a cunning old beast in [[Children|children]]'s stories who set one of his great [[Tusks|tusks]] in the sky as a warning to the bears of the North. Even in this case though, Old One-Tuskâ€™s broken ivory tusk is seen as a weapon to be feared. 
### Invoking the Claw in [[Magic|magic]]
The Claw is a destructive force but not a negative one. It is commonly invoked in [[Rituals|rituals]] which deal with battle, inflicting injury, disaster, bloodshed and [[War|war]]. Battlemages often regard the Claw as a good constellation to make their workings under; its physicality and the violence it promises can be channelled into the [[Ritual|ritual]] to provide the right mood and energy.
Like all such forces the Claw cuts both ways. Those who rely too heavily on it find that eventually they too [[Will|will]] feel its sting. Personifying the Claw in ritual should involve a ritual hunt or kill; the splash of red in the dark, the cycle of nature made manifest. 
### Tulpas of the Claw
The thought-forms of the Claw are usually bestial in aspect and, unsurprisingly, clawed. They take the form of fusions of human and beast, or of beasts of unusual size. Old One-Tusk is believed by the [[Suaq]] to have been a [[Tulpa]] of the Claw; in [[The Marches|the Marches]] some speak of Black Shucks, black dogs that sometimes walk as humans that work under the auspices of the Claw unleashed by [[Rituals|rituals]].
### [[Alignment]]
A ritualist who experiences the touch of the Claw may stalk or hunt during the ritual; or perhaps work themselves into a frenzy that only ends with a slight injury and the shedding of some of their own blood. The Claw is a dangerous constellation to align too closely to.
