## Motto
''Might and Right''
## The Manifesto
The Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] holds the following to be true:
* Magic can determine the outcome of battles and wars
* Magical power is essential in ensuring both the security, and necessary expansion of the Empire
* The Empire's enemies are capable of using magic, and the Empire must be able to counter them
The Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] therefore exists to:
* Promote the understanding and practical application of magic in military situations
* Encourage magicians to use their powers in defence of the Empire, even if they are not a warrior by calling
* Guide the use of Conclave resources for strategic and tactical use
## Symbol
A traditional symbol of this Order is a battlemage's [[Rod and Shield|rod and shield]]
## Membership of the Order
The Order of the Rod and Shield work hard to advance the use of martial magic. Many of their number are battle magicians, and it is common to see a [[Dawn|Dawnish]] warwitch, an [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial orc]] [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#Warcasters|warcaster]] and a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Warden]] all rubbing shoulders during their meetings. They lobbied for the creation of the post of [[Warmage]], and they are the order who has provided the most magicians to that post. Indeed, a warmage from an order other than the Rod and Shield often comes under pressure to join their ranks.
There is occasionally some conflict within the order between magicians who are versed in offensive spells and rituals; those whose magic is better suited to battlefield support, such as healing; and those who focus on providing enchantments to strengthen military units, campaign armies or create fortifications. For the most part though they are united by their shared understanding of the importance of magicians fighting for the Empire.
They are often at odds with the Order of the [[Golden Pyramid]] because that order sees them as encouraging magicians to be the servants of the Empire rather than receiving appropriate recompense and recognition for their skills. They also compete with the magicians of the [[Unfettered Mind]] for the position of [[Dean of the Lyceum]], recognising that by gaining that position they can help research and codify the many powerful battlefield and strategic rituals that will help the Empire triumph over its foes.
Historically the order has made several attempts to claim greater importance than other orders, claiming that achieving their goals is vital to the safety and success of the Empire. Magicians of other orders are at pains to point out that the Empire has ''always'' been at war, one way or another... that it needs wealth, political stability, good spiritual health, innovation and reliable intelligence at least as much as it needs enchanted armies.
## [[Conclave vault]]
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Rod and Shield garners a pro rata share of the [[Conclave vault#Crystal Mana|Font]] based on the [[Imperial Conclave#Principle of Precedence|precedence]] of the orders at the previous summit; a portion of [[Ilium]] based on their [[Conclave vault#Ilium|position]] among the orders as determined by precedence; and additional materials due to outstanding bequests.
These [[Conclave vault#Bequests|bequests]] are collected by the Civil Service, and provided to the Grandmaster at the start of each summit.
* Two measures of [[Ambergelt]] from the Amberspire of [[Morrow]]. This bequest began in 350YE in return for continuing to keep the forests near the spire clear of bandits and similar threats. 
* Two ingots of [[Orichalcum]] from House Dourfen of [[Upwold#Tower March|Tower March]]. This bequest dates back to the formation of the order, in remembrance of their shared history and support for Borsdell Hall.
* Two ingots of [[Tempest jade]] have been sent by the family of Dunstan Irontongue since 373YE, in recognition of the role the Rod and Shield played during the fall of [[Skarsind]].
* Three ingots of [[Green iron]] have been delivered by [[Zakalwe|Phronesis, Polemarch of Strategy]] since 258YE and will continue for as long as the order guides the use of Conclave resources for strategic and tactical purposes.
* * Following [[Inkpot gods#The Shield and the Staff|an offer]] made by [[Prospero]] at the Summer Solstice 385YE, the order owes a significant favour to the [[Eternal|eternal]].
