## Motto
''The well of life is bottomless.''
## The Manifesto
The Order of the [[Silver Chalice]] holds the following to be true:
* Life flows through each of us; our magic allows us to reach out to our fellows and nurture that life, [[Mend|mend]] what is broken, and bring what is torn apart back together.
* Healing magic has vast amounts of raw potential, but is complemented by the precise nature of physical healing
* The strength of the Empire relies on its citizens, thus by keeping citizens healthy, we strengthen the Empire
The Order of the [[Silver Chalice]] therefore exists to:
* Utilise the immensely practical applications of healing magic for the good of the empire, promote understanding of healing magic and research new healing rituals and spells
* Ensure that conclave is reminded of the value of life, and that it makes decisions with that value in mind
* Work with healers, [[Surgical skills#Physick|physicks]] and [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|apothecaries]] across the Empire, including bodies that represent such individuals, such as the Anvil Hospital
## Symbol
The Order of the [[Silver Chalice]] currently has only one recognised symbol - a cup marked with the [[Cavul|Rune of Purity]].
## Membership of the Order
The Silver Chalice is the youngest [[Conclave order]], officially formed during the Autumn Equinox 381YE. 
When the order was established, the [[Grandmaster]] did not have access to the ability to [[Grandmaster#Funding the Order|fund the order]] - the requisite investment of 30 wains of mithril was not made until shortly after the Spring Equinox 382YE. The grandmaster is now able to purchase mana in the same way as their peers.
## [[Conclave vault]]
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Silver Chalice garners a pro rata share of the [[Conclave vault#Crystal Mana|Font]] based on the [[Imperial Conclave#Principle of Precedence|precedence]] of the orders at the previous summit, and a portion of [[Ilium]] based on their [[Conclave vault#Ilium|position]] among the orders as determined by precedence. At this time, there are no outstanding bequests for the Silver Chalice.
