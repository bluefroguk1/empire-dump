## Motto
''The well of life is bottomless.''
## The Manifesto
The Order of the [[Silver Chalice]] holds the following to be true:
* Life flows through each of us; our [[Magic|magic]] allows us to reach out to our fellows and nurture that life, [[Mend|mend]] what is broken, and bring what is torn apart back together.
* Healing [[Magic|magic]] has vast amounts of raw potential, but is complemented by the precise nature of physical healing
* The strength of [[The Empire|the Empire]] relies on its citizens, thus by keeping citizens healthy, we strengthen [[The Empire|the Empire]]
The Order of the [[Silver Chalice]] therefore exists to:
* Utilise the immensely practical applications of healing magic for the good of the empire, promote understanding of healing magic and research new healing [[Rituals|rituals]] and spells
* Ensure that [[Conclave|conclave]] is reminded of the value of life, and that it makes decisions with that value in mind
* Work with healers, physicks and apothecaries across the Empire, including bodies that represent such individuals, such as the [[Anvil]] Hospital
## Symbol
The Order of the Silver Chalice currently has only one recognised symbol - a cup marked with the [[Rune]] of Purity.
## Membership of the Order
The Silver Chalice is the youngest [[Conclave order]], officially formed during the [[Autumn]] Equinox 381YE. 
When the order was established, the [[Grandmaster]] did not have access to the ability to fund the order - the requisite investment of 30 wains of [[Mithril|mithril]] was not made until shortly after the [[Spring]] Equinox 382YE. The [[Grandmaster|grandmaster]] is now able to purchase mana in the same way as their peers.
## [[Conclave vault]]
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Silver Chalice garners a pro rata share of the [[Font]] based on the precedence of the orders at the previous summit, and a portion of [[Ilium]] based on their position among the orders as determined by precedence. At this time, there are no outstanding bequests for the Silver Chalice.
