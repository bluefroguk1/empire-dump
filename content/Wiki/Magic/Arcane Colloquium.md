## Overview

The [[Arcane Colloquium]] is a special session of the [[Imperial Conclave]] that takes place on Saturday afternoon during each summit at [[Anvil]]. Beginning at three in the afternoon, it lasts for an hour and a half. During this time the [[Hall of Worlds]] hosts a series of addresses, lectures, and seminars by each of the six archmages, supported by the Civil Service. Any Imperial [[Magician|magician]] is free to attend, as are representatives of friendly nations and the heralds of eternals that are not under enmity.
Each [[Archmage|archmage]] is free to use their time as they see fit - they can set the agenda as they please, and decide who is allowed to speak. In many ways, each segment of the Colloquium can be seen as an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for an "audience" with a specific [[Archmage|archmage]], in a very similar manner to which many eternals participate in audiences with the magicians of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
The [[Arcane Colloquium]] was established during the reign of [[Empress Aenea]] in response to requests from the archmages for a way to speak to the magicians of [[The Empire|the Empire]] about pressing matters. It fell out of favour during the changes to [[The Conclave|the Conclave]] that took place in the reign of [[Emperor Nicovar]], replaced by the ''[[Declaration|declaration]] of address''. Following the reign of [[Empress Lisabetta]], the Civil Service reinstituted the colloquium as part of the [[Conclave]] restructuring.
## Format
* The Arcane Colloquium begins at three in the afternoon on Saturday each event
* During the Arcane Colloquium, each archmage has a quarter of an hour to talk with assembled magicians
* Time is allocated to the archmages in order of seniority
* Speaking does not require mana but the rules for parley are in effect throughout
* There is a short break of 15 minutes between the third and fourth sessions
The Arcane Colloquium is split into six quarter-hour sessions, each given over to one of the archmages. Seniority is given to the archmage who has served in the post for the longest uninterrupted period. Archmage seniority 
The rules of parley are in effect throughout the colloquium. The archmage in charge of each segment determines who may speak. They cannot forbid entry to the Hall of Worlds, but no magician may speak during the colloquium without permission from the presiding archmage - not even the other archmages. Speaking does not require a payment of mana, and the archmage may silence the speaker at any point. Anyone who chooses to ignore the archmage may be removed by the Civil Service or the magicians present, and as with any other violation of parley may be prosecuted for an act of subverting agencies of the state. 
At the end of each segment, the presiding archmage hands over to their next colleague in order of seniority. There is often some disruption during this handover, but refusal to cede the floor when asked to do so may also be prosecuted as subverting agencies of the state.
## Participation
* Each archmage is free to use the time allocated to them as they see fit
* The archmage can send their [[Proxy|proxy]] to take the floor in the Arcane Colloquium if they prefer
Exactly what happens during the Arcane Colloquium is a matter for each individual archmage. During their segment of the Arcane Colloquium, the archmage often begins with an address discussing matters relevant to the [[Realm|realm]] they represent. It can be an ideal time to discuss relations with eternals, or to highlight matters specific to their [[Realm|realm]]. The expectation is that magicians who have a vested interest in the appropriate [[Realm Lore|realm lore]] [[Will|will]] be able to attend, commune with their peers, and be kept up to date with matters relevant to them.
"You think I speak off the cuff? [[The Key|The key]] to a good address is preparation. Rehearse it to yourself in your head, keep it down to a minute. Use your outdoor voice. Stick to the point, and for Virtue's sake don't bore them. Make one joke, and time it right. Have them laughing, and they [[Will|will]] stand a chance of recalling what you said!"
There is no requirement that the archmage does all the talking themselves, however. The power of parley allows them to recognise anyone who wishes to speak not only so that they can engage in a debate but also to take a turn addressing the assembled magicians. They or their [[Proxy|proxy]] are also free to grant the floor to anyone they choose for as long as they please. 
The colloquium is often seen as an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for magicians to speak with their archmage - quiet discussion [[Groups|groups]] may continue even during the segments ceded to the other archmages as long as everyone involved is quiet and respectful. The colloquium also provides an opportunity for foreign magicians and the heralds of eternals to find expert practitioners of specific lores, confident that at least some of them will be in the Hall of Worlds attending the discussions and presentations.
If the archmage is unable or unwilling to attend for any reason, they can send a proxy in their steed. If the archmage or their legal proxy is not present, then that section of the Colloquium is cancelled. Magicians present are free to use the time as they please.
