### [[The Law]]
Things are Not Easy
### The [[Constellation]]
[[The Mountain]] is formed of ten stars and appears low to the horizon. Whilst the ‘peak’ is visible throughout the year, the constellation is partially obscured during the [[Winter|winter]] months, only completely rising in to view during the late [[Spring|spring]] and [[Summer|summer]].
### Symbolism
In [[Urizen]] there is a saying – "you can only go around [[The Mountain|the mountain]]". The Mountain represents obstacles, delays, and difficulties; things that must be worked around or problems that have no easy solution. The Mountain can represent a puzzle, an intractable trial, or an impossible decision; but whatever it is, you cannot ignore it – you can only go around it.
The Mountain can also mean great reward in return for great toil – such as those who work in mines in such mountains. The Mountain tells us there is no easy life or free lunch - anything [[Worth|worth]] having is [[Worth|worth]] fighting for.
### Invoking the Mountain in [[Magic|magic]]
The Mountain is invoked where a ritualist wishes to represent or call on a great obstacle or hindrance to forward progress. Before a battle, the opposing force might be represented by the Mountain; equally the Mountain is often used in curses to represent great difficulty or struggle for the target of the [[Curse|curse]].
The Mountain is often also used to represent the end of a quest; the object, achievement, or outcome desired by the ritualist to reach which requires great effort, strife, and toil.
### Tulpas of the Mountain
Tulpas of the Mountain take many forms but are often known to appear near bridges, [[Crossroads|crossroads]], or gates. There they [[Will|will]] demand any who pass to answer a riddle or perform a small task; only those who succeed [[Will|will]] be permitted to pass without further harassment. They do not appear to take any pleasure in their task, regarding it instead as a duty. 
### [[Alignment]]
Ritualists who come close to the Mountain in [[Ritual|ritual]] report that they are often overwhelmed by a feeling of immobility and obstreperousness. They become awkward, uncommunicative, unfriendly and wilfully difficult.
