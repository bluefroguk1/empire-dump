## Overview
[[Riqueza]], [[Erigo]], and [[Guerra]], the founders of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]], were known as accomplished [[Ritual|ritual]] magicians, and [[Magic|magic]] is a source of wonder and pleasure to the [[Freeborn]]. They expect people performing [[Magic|magic]] to entertain, and many Freeborn magicians [[Will|will]] enhance their [[Rituals|rituals]] with stage [[Magic|magic]] tricks simply to please the crowd. Some Freeborn learn a handful of non-magical sleight-of-hand tricks or illusions while a few entertainers specialise enough to develop a whole act.
## Traditions
Freeborn ritualists practice a tradition that says ritual [[Magic|magic]] is the act of building up power from the participants and creating a connection to the [[Realms]], rather than the more traditional assumption that the [[Magician|magician]] draws power down from the Realms to the world. As such, all their [[Rituals|rituals]] attempt to include their bystanders as participants whether that is chanting, clapping or singing.
Magicians of each [[Tribe|tribe]] bring a unique perspective to their magical arts.
* The [[Riqueza]] perform ritual [[Magic|magic]] using loud, rhythmic, energetic drumming. [[Riqueza]] commonly make extensive use of [[Night magic]], especially [[Rituals|rituals]] that  grant intuition, or inspire passions. 
* The [[Guerra]] prefer physical movement combined with fire and light. [[Guerra]] often specialise in [[Day magic]], especially [[Rituals|rituals]] that divine facts or reveal truth.
* The [[Erigo]] use a less energetic style, often accompanying their [[Rituals|rituals]] with soothing, harmonious [[Music|music]]. Morso than the other tribes, the [[Erigo]] generally expect to be recompensed for the magic they work. As adepts of [[Summer magic]] that aids warriors, and [[Autumn magic]] that can grant powerful enchantments to fleets or businesses they are rarely short of customers.
Most Freeborn ritual [[Groups|groups]] prefer to work magic at [[Night|night]], in the open air, in the same way the founders did. The tradition of [[Astronomancy]] is particularly popular with Freeborn magicians, although some older covens use an eclectic blend of spirit animals and [[Dramaturgy]] in their magic.
## [[Hakima]]
While ritual magicians within a [[Family|family]] are hardly unknown, the more powerful and organised magicians in Freeborn society are the [[Hakima]]. These politically active covens view other Freeborn magicians as unsophisticated dabblers at best, and ignorant meddlers at worst. The [[Hakima|hakima]] are highly skilled practitioners of ritual magic and custodians of magical lore handed down to them by the founders of the tribes. They are dedicated to preserving the integrity of the nation as a whole and regularly look to recruit competent ritual magicians from the tribes into their own circles.
More than being just magicians, the [[Hakima|hakima]] exemplify a connection to the founders of the tribes and the [[History|history]] of the Freeborn. They are traditionally held to be wise, able to perceive the larger picture more effectively than most Freeborn who are anchored in more mundane activities. They may be consulted when important decisions need to be made within a [[Family|family]], or when magical [[Assistance|assistance]] is sought. They rarely wait to be consulted, however â€“ a [[Hakima|hakima]] is likely to be poking around any important [[Business|business]] ready to offer a suggestion as to what to do next.
## [[Family]] Magicians
Within a [[Family]], there is often at least one individual who has made a more serious study of magic. These individuals accept a responsibility for teaching relatives who are interested in learning a few magical knacks and use their magic to help their [[Family|family]] and harm their enemies as well as try to scry the vagaries of fortune and fate. These magicians tend to be practical, and often combine their study of magic with crafting or medicinal lore.
It is much more common for a family magician to be an expert in [[Spellcasting]], rather than ritual magic. That said, some larger families maintain a [[Coven]] of ritual magicians who concentrate on providing enchantments to aid their members. There is some rivalry between these family covens and the hakima.
