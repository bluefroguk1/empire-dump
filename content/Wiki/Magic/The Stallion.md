### [[The Law]]
Things Procreate
### The [[Constellation]]
[[The Stallion]] is a complex constellation of 14 stars and is located beneath [[The Phoenix|the Phoenix]]. It is most easily located by following the line of the fixed star of [[The Chain|the Chain]], through the rear of [[The Phoenix|the Phoenix]] and down to the centre of [[The Stallion|the Stallion]]’s back.
### Symbolism
[[The Stallion]] represents [[Prosperity|prosperity]] and the urge to grow and procreate. It is a symbol of strength and virility; of the quality of the bloodline and of the value of [[Children|children]]. Some coarser interpretations in [[The League|the League]] and [[Navarr]] strongly associate [[The Stallion]] with the act of coitus but more properly it refers to action begetting consequence.
A deeper symbolism attached to [[The Stallion|the Stallion]] refers of course to its nature as a [[Horse|horse]]; the Imperial emblem. The Stallion can refer in magical workings to [[The Empire|the Empire]] itself or to its leaders.
### Using the Stallion in [[Magic|magic]]
The most obvious use of The Stallion in [[Ritual|ritual]] is to invoke blessings on unborn children; however it is also used as a fertility symbol in rites to do with agriculture growth and [[Business|business]]. Fertility is not just to do with making babies; two coins invested wisely [[Will|will]] make their own kinds of babies. The Stallion also has strong associations with children in ritual; as protector of the herd and as teacher.
### Tulpas of the Stallion
Some legends speak of creatures half [[Horse|horse]] half man deep in the forests – sometimes these are said to be near feral but other times are regarded as wise teachers. There is an old tale among the Dawnish yeofolk of the mysterious ale merchant who plies a shy husband with ale on his wedding [[Night|night]] to give him the [[Courage|courage]] to approach his beautiful but intimidating spouse naked.
### [[Alignment]]
Ritualists who invoke the Stallion speak of a sense of great virility, [[Pride|pride]] in [[Family|family]] and overwhelming sense of freedom – and indeed of a heightened desire to secure their own [[Lineage|lineage]]. More than one ritualist in such a state has found themselves doused with cold water by their own collaborators.
