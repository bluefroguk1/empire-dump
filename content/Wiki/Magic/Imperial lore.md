This page is about the [[Declaration]] by the [[Imperial Conclave]]. For details of [[Imperial lore]] and the [[Ritual|ritual]] list see [[Formulaic ritual|formulaic ritual]].
## Overview
[[Rituals]] that are part of [[Imperial lore]] are widely available to any Imperial citizen. Any Imperial [[Magician|magician]] can learn to master a [[Formulaic ritual]] that is part of Imperial lore, making the ritual significantly easier and cheaper to cast. New [[Rituals|rituals]] are added to Imperial lore by this [[Declaration]]. It instructs the Civil Service to arrange for a specific [[Ritual text|ritual text]] to be duplicated and disseminated to magicians across [[The Empire|the Empire]], adding it to the body of Imperial lore that is available to every citizen.
Once a ritual is added to Imperial lore it is currently impossible to remove it. The best [[The Conclave|the Conclave]] can do is to declare performance of the ritual to be illegal with the Declaration of [[Interdiction]]. The Civil Service once proposed the [[Imperial Senate]] grant the [[Conclave]] the power to remove a ritual from Imperial Lore, but they declined to take up the option.
The [[Dean of the Lyceum]] is empowered to raise a Declaration of Imperial Lore to the agenda once each summit.
## Necessary Details
* The Declaration must explicitly name the ritual to be added to Imperial Lore
* The proposer must have the ritual text for the ritual in hand when they are invited to present their Declaration
The ritual to be included in Imperial lore must be explicitly named as part of the Declaration. At the point in the [[Conclave session]] where the civil service invite the magician raising the Declaration to present it, that magician must present a completed formulaic ritual text for the named ritual. If they cannot hand over the ritual text at the start of the Declaration then the agenda item is immediately cancelled and matters move to the next item.
## Debate
* Each [[Grandmaster|grandmaster]] may send a single representative to examine the ritual text
The civil service [[Will|will]] hold the ritual text throughout the declaration. The civil service [[Will|will]] ''not'' pause the [[Conclave session]] to allow examination of the ritual text - but any [[Grandmaster]] may send a single representative to examine the text in the minute after the presentation is complete or ''while'' the Declaration is debated. Given the time constraints it is advisable for the magician raising the Declaration to ensure the grandmasters are already familiar with the ritual text before Conclave begins.
## Resolution
* If the vote passes the ritual can be added to Imperial Lore
* It costs ten thrones to add a ritual to Imperial Lore
If the vote passes then the civil service will keep the ritual text so that it can be used to disseminate the ritual; it is consumed in the process of making the ritual public knowledge. In addition, ten thrones are required to pay for distribution of the ritual (OOC: These funds should be placed in the inventory of a character, who should email plot@profounddecisions.co.uk with details of their CID and the ritual being paid for after the event.)
In the event that the ritual text is illegal in some fashion - if it draws power from an [[Eternal]] under enmity for example, or is currently interdicted - the Civil Service will ensure the [[Magistrates|magistrates]] are informed after the Conclave session. ''However'' the successful Declaration of Imperial Lore still stands; the otherwise illegal ritual will still be added to Imperial lore.
If the vote fails then ritual text will be returned to the magician raising the Declaration. 
## Arcane Projections
* It is not legal to add arcane projections to Imperial Lore'
During a recent conclave session, a ritual was the subject of a Declaration of Imperial lore on the strength of an [[Arcane projection]]. The Declaration passed and a similar codified ritual was eventually added to Imperial lore, but the Civil Service note that it is not legal to proceed in this matter and it would not be allowed in the future. This is because it is possible for the properties of a ritual to fundamentally change when it is codified.
