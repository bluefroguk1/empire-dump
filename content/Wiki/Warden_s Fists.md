## Description
It is said that the first pair of Warden's Fists was crafted by a [[warden]] born of both the [[Varushka_history|Vard and the Ushka]], she made and named them ''Brother and Sister'' for the siblings that she never had. However the [[Navarr]] claim that the wardens learnt the secret from their [[Navarr_magical_traditions#Vates|vates]] who claim that they were originally called ''[[Navarr_history|Terunael’s]] Fists'' and were a common weapon in their war against what came before the [[Vallorn]].

The [[Varushka_Lineage_and_Species_Attitudes#Company_of_the_White_Stag|Company of the White Stag]] often refer to Warden's Fists as ''Antlers'', and shape the [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] component of the axe and rod into complex tangs often resembling their own, as a maker’s mark.

In [[Urizen]] they are favourite among the [[sentinel|sentinels]] who believe that the balance between martial and magical is the best demonstration of [[Arete]], a fight that can be altered by quickly removing pivotal opponents is one that you win without wasted lives.

## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you may either use the weapon to call [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]] or instead use the implement to cast [[repel]] without spending [[Heroic skills#Hero Points|hero points]] or [[Magical skills|mana]].
* Materials: Crafting a set of Warden's Fists requires two measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], two ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], two ingots of [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] and two ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. It takes one month to make a pair of these items.

The Wolves circled her in the creeping darkness of the forest. The wall that was a road was out of sight now. She had been tracking them for days, and nights, without sleep. She could smell the putrid breath of the flesh-feasters, as they hissed in gloating hunger. 

Maybe three of them. No, four.

She was alone.

She crouched in the glade, undergrowth knotted about her feet. She was wounded, a gash in the side from a bone sharp branch. Her power was spent, and the Wolves could smell the metallic tang of blood in the air. They made a guttural noise in their throats. She tensed.

“I am ready.” She called forth words of power, drawing not on her depleted resources but on the power of her dragonbone rod. It flared to life as her words caressed it.

The first two charged, her Antlers flashed, their tangs finding homes in the ribs of one of the monsters. She struck it with her rod and it fled,  wheeling back into the woods. The second fell back before her, the orichalcum of her axe glowing gently in the gathering twilight. She'd hardly worked up a sweat. 

The remaining couple came crashing and snarling out of the gloomy brush. 
 
Two-on-one, now those were better odds. She sheathed her rod and unslung her shield.
