## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
  When this ritual is performed by a [[Groups#Coven|coven]], the target must be [[Rituals#Contributors|contributing]] to the ritual.

 

### Effects
The target gains the ability to cast the [[detect magic]] spell four times each day as if they know it without spending any mana.

They also experience a [[roleplaying effect]]: you find magic fascinating; it's enjoyable to talk about it and even more enjoyable to observe it being cast or experience it first hand. You also may experience odd sensory effects; any spell that you hear being cast causes you to perceive dramatic displays of colourful light that can be quite distracting. When you are in a location with a magical aura such as a [[Chamber of Delights]] or a [[regio]] you will experience peculiar visions of colours and shapes, as well as peculiar snatches of sound. Coming into contact with a magic item can likewise cause you to experience mild visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations.

If the target regains all spent personal mana by resting in a magical aura such as that provided by [[the Chamber of Delights]], or drinks an [[Philtres_of_the_High_Peaks#The_Elixir_of_Empyrean_Art|Elixir of Empyrean Art]], they ''also'' regain all spent uses of this ability at the same time. Other methods of restoring personal mana do not restore uses of [[detect magic]].



### Option

### Additional Targets
The ritual can target additional characters provided each is also a contributor to the performance of the ritual. Each additional target increases the magnitude of the ritual by 8.
