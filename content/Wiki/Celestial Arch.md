## Motto
''Knowledge and power in union.''

## The Manifesto
The Order of the Celestial Arch holds the following to be true:

* Both politics and magic are the art of the judicious application of power
* Magicians, by nature of their knowledge, discipline, perception and power are prepared for leadership
* Negotiation with eternals and diplomacy with foreign powers are comparable skills, and of comparable importance to the Empire

The Order of the Celestial Arch therefore exists to:

* Ensure that major political decisions receive the benefit and insight of Conclave mages
* Encourage those in positions of leadership and authority to hone their skill through study of magic
* Ensure unity of purpose between the Conclave and the Senate

## Symbol
A symbol that has been associated with this Order in the past has been a dark blue archway surmounting a six-pointed star

## Membership of the Order
The Celestial Arch often works closely with Senators seeking a voice in the Conclave, and prepared to return the favour in the [[Imperial Senate]]. They lobby constantly for more magicians to take up political life, and make no secret of the fact that many of them support magical training as a prerequisite of candidacy for the Senate. The order often tries to recruit magicians who are also Senators, or at the very least to maintain good relations with them.

They tend to make an effort to maintain good relations between the Empire and friendly [[eternal|eternals]], while being quick to identify eternals who are enemies of the Empire and proscribe interaction with them. As with the [[Sevenfold Path]] they have a no-nonsense approach to magicians who fall back on curses and other actions likely to damage the standing of magicians as a whole in the Empire - a surprising number of [[The Marches magical traditions#Threshers|threshers]] who are also magicians belong to this order.

The grandmasters of the Celestial Arch try to wield magic and politics with equal aplomb. This order tends to attract a number of [[Urizen]] [[Urizen magical traditions#Mages|mages]], which can often give them easy access to crystal mana.

As magicians interested in political, as well as magical, power the Celestial Arch often see the advantage of strategies that will garner political favours, either within the Conclave or with other Imperial bodies. While their main interest usually lies with the Senate, they see the value of encouraging the [[Imperial Military Council|Military Council]], [[Imperial Synod|Synod]] or [[Imperial Bourse|Bourse]] to feel indebted to the Conclave - which means they may find themselves ready allies in the [[Rod and Shield]], [[Sevenfold Path]] or [[Golden Pyramid]] as a consequence.

## Conclave vault
Each summit, the [[Conclave vault]] of the Celestial Arch garners a pro rata share of the [[Conclave_vault#Crystal_Mana|Font]] based on the [[Imperial Conclave#Principle of Precedence|precedence]] of the orders at the previous summit; a portion of [[ilium]] based on their [[Conclave_vault#Ilium|position]] among the orders as determined by precedence; and additional materials due to outstanding bequests.
* Two ingots of [[tempest jade]] from the Guild of the Golden Signets in [[Sarvos]] in recognition for the order's assistance in removing a declaration of sorcery from the serving [[senator]] of the territory during the reign of [[Empress Teleri]].
* Three measures of [[dragonbone]] come from the steading of Rhys' Seat in [[Miaren]]. The original reason of the bequest was lost during the reign of [[Emperor Nicovar]], but the bequest has been steady since 27YE and is apparently connected to the order's role in helping destroy the [[vallorn]] that once dominated the territory. 
* Three measures of [[iridescent gloaming]] come from Brokenfountain Citadel and the Spire of the Frozen Watcher in [[Redoubt]] dating back to 330YE when Enchantress Geraint de Blorhbeau, as grandmaster, negotiated an end to the feud between the two rival spires.
* 3 wains of [[mithril]] each season from [[Faraden]] merchants and wizards grateful for the Conclave's role in [[Through_my_sails#The_Gloaming_Blight|ending the iridescent gloaming blight]] in their country. The mithril was [[383YE_Summer_Solstice_Conclave_sessions#Endowment_.E2.80.93_Faraden_bequest_be_granted_to_Celestial_Arch|endowed on the order]] in Summer 383YE. 
* Following [[Inkpot_gods#The_Arch_and_The_Web|an offer]] made by [[Prospero]] at the Summer Solstice 385YE, the order owes a significant favour to the eternal.
