### Overview
The history of the army of the [[Golden Axe]] is a history of sustained assault, horrible battles and massive losses. The Varushkan soldiers are philosophical - someone has to do the hard work - but also adaptable. They consider themselves good at surviving against odds that would devastate other armies; they are known for ruthlessly crushing all opposition during their slow grinding advance through enemy territory. Pessimism has become the norm for the officers of this army, although their dire pronouncements of failure are often rendered incorrect by their own heroism and fortitude. In recent years they have been [[Army qualities#Driven|driven]] to embrace legacy of the Vard; to conquer what can be conquered, to bar their door against what cannot be defeated, and to endure what must be endured without flinching.

Furthermore, as of the Summer Solstice 383YE, the Golden Axe is a [[Imperial_army#Enlargement|large]] army, reinforced by [[Our_choice#The_Wealth_of_Varushka|the wealth of Varushka]] with the aid of the mining families of Moresvah in Karsk..

The second Varushkan General leads the Army of the Golden Axe, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Winter solstice each year.
