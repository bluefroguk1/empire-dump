## Description
A pectoral comes in a variety of forms, but the most common are a jewelled necklace that is suspended from the neck. They often have a large medallion, usually marked with runes. Regardless of their shape, a Sunfire Pectoral is formed of orichalcum alloyed with gold or occasionally copper, coloured and polished with iridescent gloaming, and usually with green iron alloy chains or buckles holding it in place. They are often inlaid with decorative gemstones. It is common to see a Sunfire Pectoral marked with a heraldic device in [[Dawn]], the [[The League|League]], [[Highguard]] and the [[The Marches|Marches]], but even in nations where heraldry is not common they tend to bear a symbol of either a leaping flame (especially in the [[The Brass Coast|Brass Coast]], where a particularly garishly decorated pectoral is sometimes called a ''Flav's flame'' after a notorious [[corsair]] battle-magician) or the sun - a common symbol of the Virtue of [[Pride]].

Wearers often seem to be energetic and passionate, and are especially vocal about strongly held beliefs or philosophies. It is common for the pectoral to bear the rune [[Zorech]], which accentuates these traits.
