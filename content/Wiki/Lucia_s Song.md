Words and tune by Claire Sheridan.

Written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach in Proud memory of Lucia Cascade. 


Part I

Light up the Spires,
Light up the night,
Come see the starsâ€™
Silver light;

Reach out your fingers,
Reach out your voice,
Mages of music,
Rejoice. 

Part II

Cascade of stars
Silver-blue glow:

Strike, strum, call, chant
Let it flow.

Part III

Light up the Spires,
Light up the night,
Come see the starlight;

Reach out your fingers,
Reach out your voice,
Mages of music rejoice.
