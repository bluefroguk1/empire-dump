## Overview
The Guardian of Afal is a [[the Marches|Marcher]] [[Imperial title]] [[Construct_Prosperity_of_Afal|anounced]] by Vikas Blake, the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] in Summer 382YE. The position of Guardian is a [[sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities
The Guardian has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Game_items#Mana_Crystals|crystal mana]] from the [[#Afal-on-Ash|apple-tree stand]] in [[Upwold]]. If the glade were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Guardian to deal with those threats. The initial announcement indicated that the title should only be held by a citizen of Upwold. While that is not something that can be made legally binding, it is likely that other Upwolders may look askance at senators who appoint anyone other than a proper resident of the Silver Chase.

## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Guardian of Afal gains custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. They receive an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
### Honey and Apples
The Guardian also receives regular gifts of apples, apple-blossom honey, honeycomb, and similar products from residents of the nearby area who appreciate the restful nature of the glade they oversee. While this has no game effect, the Guardian may gain a reputation for being an expert on such things, and should feel free to roleplay that they have easy access to victuals of this nature.

==Appointment== 
The Guardian of Afal is elected by unanimous decision of the Marcher [[senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 

The title can be held by a Marcher citizen. The Guardian has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Marcher [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].

## Afal-on-Ash
Near the waters of the river Ash in Afal, in [[Upwold#Ashbrook|Ashbrook]], [[Upwold]], stands a grove of seven apple trees. Arranged in a ring, each tree is hung with seven model behives made of mithril, no bigger than a large apple. These forty-nine artifical beehives are beautiful symbols of [[Prosperity]], swinging gently in the breeze, catching the sunlight and reflecting around the glade. In the center of the peaceful stand of trees is a stone plinth, the top hollowed to form a mithril-lined bowl inlaid with the runes [[Bravash]], [[Verys]], and [[Pallas]]. The bowl is filled each morning with water from the river Ash, and warmed by the sun. Over time, shards of crystal mana begin to form in the bowl. It takes time, but over the course of several weeks a single perfectly spherical mana crystal forms in the water.

The glade possesses an odd quality of restfulness. When the weather is good, attendants and visitors can often be found lounging beneath the trees chatting quietly and sharing food and drink - especially when the trees are fruiting. The effect becomes most pronounced for the hour on either side of sunset, when it is deceptively easy for visitors unprepared for the aura to be lulled to gentle, peaceful sleep by the lapping of the river, and the soughing of the wind through the branches of the apple trees.

The [[Monastery#Monks|monks]] at the nearby [[monastery]] have long been known for the fine honey produced by their bees; since the completion of the glades they are reporting richer, more bountiful honey than ever before. The abbot is confident for their increased bounty is the shaping the mana flows around the quiet glade.
