## The Bleeding Wound, Rune of Blood
''Affiliated with the Realm of Spring''

Rhyv is the Bleeding Wound, which represents both life and the potential to end it. Just as the life of a human or animal lies in the blood in their veins, so the life of the tree lies in the sap and the life of the world flows through the water that covers its surface. For this reason Rhyv features heavily in healing magic, but it can also be used with magic intended to corrupt or slow the flow of life through venom or disease. It is often called the Bloody Knife, representing both its ability to harm life, and the chirurgeonâ€™s art of cutting out sickness. it should come as no surprise that the [[Anvil#The_Anvil_Hospital|Imperial School of Medicine]] displays Rhyv on its banners.

Rhyv is linked to the idea of self-sacrifice (especially among the [[Navarr]], [[The Marches|Marchers]] and [[Varushka|Varushkans]]), and in this aspect is called the Fallen Fruit. It represents both the idea of shedding blood for another, and of the success that comes from hard work and sweat. 

Given its connection to the blood, it should come as no surprise that this rune is said to have a strong connection to the [[Briar]] lineage.

### Using Rhyv In Magic
Rhyv is most commonly evoked during rituals concerning bodily healing and health, but is also evoked in rituals that taint, poison or hamper body or life. It may be evoked in its positive aspect when using incantations such as [[heal]] or [[purify]]. In its negative aspect it can be used to taint or corrupt the blood as part of the [[weakness]] and especially the [[venom]] incantations.

### Crafting with Rhyv
Chirurgeons and apothecaries use the rune on healing preparations, and may inscribe it on medical tools. Commonly, Rhyv will be stamped into a [[Healer's Harness]]. Because of its association with the flow of blood, Rhyv is also used on weapons especially those intended to kill quickly, or leave devastating wounds. Many Navarr [[Thorn|Thorns]] inscribe the runes on their barbed spears, but it is also favoured on the daggers of cutthroats which gives it a negative reputation.
