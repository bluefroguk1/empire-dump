New lyrics by Jamie Wakefield

Chords: Verse – Am G Dm G Dm Am; Chorus/Coda – Am C G


Verse 1
My dreams. Awake. A call
A cry breaks over the wall 
On the west wall
We’ll be free
On the west wall
You and me.

Verse 2
Once more, the spawn hath come
Our hearts won’t be undone
On the west wall
We’re fighting free
On the west wall
Heroes we.

Chorus
One beat
One heart 
One time
One call
''(repeat)''

With your sword
In your hand
You’ll rise
or you’ll fall

One beat
One heart 
One time
One Call

Verse 3
And though, our foe draws near
We’ll show these beasts no fear
On the west wall
We’re fighting free
On the west wall
Heroes we.

Chorus

Reprise verse
'Cause on the west wall
We are free
On the west wall
You and me.

Instrumental

Verse 4
And if my sword should fall
Then who’ll be next on the wall.
'Cause on the west wall
We are free
On the west wall
You and me.

Chorus

Reprise verse

Chorus

Coda
One beat
One heart 
One time
One call

One beat
One heart 
One time
On the wall
