## Description
A re-purposed farming tool, the Reaving Mattock has a heavy steel head and a stout oak handle inlaid with tempest jade. What a mundane mattock does to hard or frozen soil, the Reaving Mattock does to enemy soldiers, leaving them bleeding to death or crippled. They are unsurprisingly popular with the agriculturally-minded [[Yeoman of the Marches|yeomen of the Marches]] and with the [[Varushka|Varushkans]], and much less so with the citizens of the [[The League|League]], [[Dawn]] and [[Urizen]] due to their associations with farming.

These weapons were among the first weapons crafted by the [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial Orc]] [[Crafting_skills#Artisan|artisans]] after they joined the Empire, many of whom were familiar with similar tools from their time in the mines, or working the farms. They have remained a popular choice, especially with those Orcs who prefer to spend their time [[Imperial_Orcs_economic_interests#Reavers|slaughtering their barbarian cousins]] rather than embracing the strict discipline of the Imperial armies.

## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you may call [[Calls#IMPALE|IMPALE]] with this two-handed weapon.
* Materials: Crafting a Reaving Mattock requires seven ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
