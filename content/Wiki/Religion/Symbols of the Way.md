## [[The Way]] of Virtue
[[The Way]] of Virtue has several symbols to represent it across [[The Empire|the Empire]], but there are two that are widely used by the [[Imperial Synod]], and priests of [[The Way|the Way]] may have items or regalia marked by such symbols.
* The Seven-Spoked Wheel – The wheel is a symbol of the journey that each spirit must make and each of the spokes represents one of the Virtues all of which converge on a single point, that of rebirth.
* The Labyrinth of Ages – The Labyrinth is depicted in a number of ways, but usually within a circle. Most designs favour seven co-centric circles or other elements to represent the seven virtues. Some symbols represent a labyrinth with only one path through from the outside to the centre, while others favour a labyrinth with multiple routes, depending on the attitude of the artist to the virtues. 
As [[The Way|the Way]] is concerned with the journey of the spirit from birth-to-death-to-rebirth, some priests and pilgrims carry or adorn themselves with items and regalia of travel.

## The Paths of Virtue
There are a great many symbols associated with the individual Virtues, and no exhaustive or definitive list exists. Many are drawn from well-known stories or parables about the virtue, while others are associated with long-held traditions such as the bird imagery of [[Wintermark]], the virtuous animals of [[Varushka]], or even the magical [[Runes|runes]] said to have an association with each virtue.
