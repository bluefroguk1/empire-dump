## Overview
In [[Spring]] 382YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to create a [[Roll of Benefactors|roll of benefactors]]. The roll creates a permanent list Imperial citizens who have made significant, prosperous contributions to the implementation of approved [[Senate Motions|senate motions]]. Named “[[Benefactors]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]]”, the [[Assembly]] of [[Prosperity]] is responsible for adding names to the list. 
### Adding to the Roll
To add a name to the [[Roll of Benefactors|roll of benefactors]], a member of the [[Prosperity]] [[Assembly|assembly]] raises a [[Statement of Principle]], which must pass with a [[Greater majority|greater majority]]. The roll is updated each season. As always with a [[Statement of Principle|statement of principle]] that receives a greater majority, there may potentially be additional effects (although this is much less common in a [[Virtue assembly|virtue assembly]]).
