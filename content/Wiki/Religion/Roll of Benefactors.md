## Overview
In Spring 382YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to create a Roll of [[Roll of Benefactors]]. The roll creates a permanent list Imperial citizens who have made significant, Prosperous contributions to the implementation of approved [[Senate Motions]]. Named “Benefactors of [[The Empire]]”, the [[Assembly]] of [[Prosperity]] is responsible for adding names to the list. 
### Adding to the Roll
To add a name to the roll of benefactors, a member of the Prosperity assembly raises a [[Statement of Principle]], which must pass with a greater majority. The roll is updated each season. As always with a statement of principle that receives a greater majority, there may potentially be additional effects (although this is much less common in a Virtue virtue assembly).
## Benefactors of the Empire
### Heilyn Bronwen's Rest
Heilyn was added to the Roll of Benefactors during the Spring Equinox 383YE by Darien Numbers. The [[Judgement]] as upheld by 246 votes to 0.
Heilyn Bronwen's Rest was recognised for their tireless and never-ending work in his position of [[Warmage]]. They are scrupulous in ensuring every ring spent gives the maximum impact for the Imperial [[War]] effort. They ensure all mages who assist are treated fairly and with prosperity in mind in every detail. They make certain that everyone who assists in gathering the [[Materials]] required gives real value to the [[Imperial treasury]], whilst also remaining prosperous. These qualities have created a strong network of trusted citizens they can call upon to drive bigger and better works of [[Magic]] every season.
