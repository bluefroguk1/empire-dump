Title: Hallow
---
## Overview
By hallowing an object, the priest creates a potent [[Aura#Item Aura|item aura]] drawn from their virtue. Item auras produce a roleplaying effect which can influence [[The Way|the way]] the character with the item acts, but they do ''not'' act as a source of spiritual strength so they cannot be used to overcome other roleplaying effects.
An item may only have one [[Aura|aura]] on it at once, so creating a new [[Aura|aura]] automatically replaces any existing standard [[Aura|aura]]. A [[Aura#Strong Auras|strong aura]] is more difficult to remove. Characters with the same virtue can [[Religious skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] to create a strong hallowing or to remove or replace an existing one.
The [[Hallow|hallow]] ceremony is not the only way that an object may acquire an influential aura. There are many stories of an item used in a significant, dramatic way acquiring a spontaneous aura associated with spiritual power - although such events are hardly common. Some curses and dangerous spirits have the ability to create effects similar in effect to a hallowing, especially on items central to the nature of the malediction or ghost.

## Performance
* Requires a dose of [[Liao|liao]] and at least ten seconds appropriate roleplaying
* Requires the presence and assistance of a referee
* It is not possible to use [[Hallow|hallow]] to create an aura on large immobile objects.
* The priest must choose which aura they are creating during the ceremony
Hallowing an item uses a dose of [[Liao]]. Performing the ceremony requires at least ten seconds of appropriate roleplaying and the item must be close enough to touch throughout.
After you [[Hallow|hallow]] an item it is infused with a standard [[Aura#Item Aura|item aura]] that makes the bearer subject to a [[Roleplaying effect]] chosen by you. You must choose one aura from the list available for the virtue you are dedicated to. It may take a short time for the aura to form completely.
You must have a referee to perform a hallowing. The referee will take your [[Liao|liao]]. You should then go to GOD to exchange your ribbon for the replacement with the hallowing effect added.
You can use hallow on any item - even if it does not have a ribbon.
## Effects
* Hallow creates an [[Aura#Item Aura|item aura]] on a mundane or [[Magic Items|magic item]] and names the item
* A hallowing on a bonded magic item lasts as long as the item remains enchanted; a hallowing on a mundane item lasts for a year (until the start of the Profound Decisions Empire event four events from now).
* Anyone who examines the item will be able to sense the presence of the aura
* [[Orc|Orcs]] are affected by hallowed items just like any other character
* A hallowing does ''not'' provide a source of spiritual strength for overcoming roleplaying effects.
Hallowing a bonded magical item creates an item [[Aura]] that lasts as long as the enchantment on the item. A mundane item can also be hallowed, in which case the aura lasts until the start of the Profound Decisions Empire event four events from now. 
In addition the item receives a unique name chosen by the character performing the hallowing - this name appears on the ribbon for the item and is any player who handles the item may choose to have their character able to discern the name as a strong impression received while handling it. Comedic names or names which are ''obviously'' taken from existing works of fiction are not appropriate for item names in Empire and will be rejected when identified.
A hallowing on any item that does not have an expiry date already lasts a year. The roleplaying effects from a hallowing expire when the item expires.
The [[Religious skills#Ceremony Strength|strength]] of the hallowing determines how difficult it is to remove or replace.
## Removal
* A hallowing on a bonded magic item lasts for as long as the item retains its properties.
* A hallowing on a mundane item lasts for a year.
* The hallow skill can be used to remove an existing hallowing.
As with any aura, an item can only be under the effect of one item aura at once. Hallowing an item that is already under the effects of a standard aura will automatically replace that aura. A strong aura is more difficult to replace - the new hallowing must have a strength at least equal to that of the existing hallowing of the ceremony will fail.
Any character with the hallow skill (including one who is not dedicated to a Virtue) may attempt to remove an existing hallowing rather than replacing it. In the case of a strong hallowing, the ceremony must still have a strength at least equal to that of the existing aura.
The hallow skill can also be used to remove item auras arising from other sources, including those created by some magical [[Enchantment|enchantments]].
If a bonded magic item is reforged, any hallowing present is removed.
## True [[Liao]]
* True liao can be used in place of liao to perform the hallow ceremony
* An artefact can ''only'' be hallowed using true liao
* A true item aura allows the use of one additional dose of liao when performing a ceremony
You can use true liao in place of normal liao to hallow an item. This will create a true aura, it can only be replaced or removed using true liao or something of similar power. An [[Magic items#Artefacts|artefact]] ''cannot'' be hallowed except by using true liao to create a [[Aura#Strong Auras|true aura]].
A true aura on an item allows the character carrying the item to make use of one additional dose of liao whenever they perform a ceremony, allowing them to create effects with greater [[Religious skills#Ceremony Strength|strength]].
