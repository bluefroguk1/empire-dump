## Overview
By hallowing an object, the priest creates a potent item [[Aura|aura]] drawn from their virtue. Item auras produce a [[Roleplaying effect|roleplaying effect]] which can influence [[The Way|the way]] the character with the item acts, but they do ''not'' act as a source of spiritual strength so they cannot be used to overcome other [[Roleplaying effects|roleplaying effects]].
An item may only have one [[Aura|aura]] on it at once, so creating a new [[Aura|aura]] automatically replaces any existing standard [[Aura|aura]]. A strong [[Aura|aura]] is more difficult to remove. [[Characters]] with the same virtue can cooperate to create a strong hallowing or to remove or replace an existing one.
The [[Hallow|hallow]] ceremony is not the only way that an object may acquire an influential aura. There are many stories of an item used in a significant, dramatic way acquiring a spontaneous aura associated with spiritual power - although such [[Events|events]] are hardly common. Some curses and dangerous spirits have the ability to create effects similar in effect to a hallowing, especially on items central to the nature of the malediction or ghost.

## Performance
* Requires a dose of [[Liao|liao]] and at least ten seconds [[Appropriate roleplaying|appropriate roleplaying]]
* Requires the presence and [[Assistance|assistance]] of a [[Referee|referee]]
* It is not possible to use [[Hallow|hallow]] to create an aura on large immobile objects.
* The priest must choose which aura they are creating during the ceremony
Hallowing an item uses a dose of [[Liao]]. Performing the ceremony requires at least ten seconds of [[Appropriate roleplaying|appropriate roleplaying]] and the item must be close enough to touch throughout.
After you [[Hallow|hallow]] an item it is infused with a standard item aura that makes the bearer subject to a Roleplaying effect chosen by you. You must choose one aura from the list available for the virtue you are dedicated to. It may take a short time for the aura to form completely.
You must have a [[Referee|referee]] to perform a hallowing. The referee [[Will|will]] take your [[Liao|liao]]. You should then go to GOD to exchange your ribbon for the replacement with the hallowing effect added.
You can use [[Hallow|hallow]] on any item - even if it does not have a ribbon.
## Effects
* [[Hallow]] creates an item aura on a mundane or [[Magic|magic]] item and names the item
* A hallowing on a bonded [[Magic|magic]] item lasts as long as the item remains [[Enchanted|enchanted]]; a hallowing on a mundane item lasts for a year (until the start of the Profound Decisions Empire event four [[Events|events]] from now).
* Anyone who examines the item [[Will|will]] be able to sense the presence of the aura
* Orcs are affected by hallowed items just like any other character
* A hallowing does ''not'' provide a source of spiritual strength for overcoming [[Roleplaying effects|roleplaying effects]].
Hallowing a bonded [[Magical Item|magical item]] creates an item Aura that lasts as long as the [[Enchantment|enchantment]] on the item. A mundane item can also be hallowed, in which case the aura lasts until the start of the Profound Decisions Empire event four [[Events|events]] from now. 
In addition the item receives a unique name chosen by the character performing the hallowing - this name appears on the ribbon for the item and is any player who handles the item may choose to have their character able to discern the name as a strong impression received while handling it. Comedic names or names which are ''obviously'' taken from existing works of fiction are not appropriate for item names in Empire and [[Will|will]] be rejected when identified.
A hallowing on any item that does not have an expiry date already lasts a year. The roleplaying effects from a hallowing expire when the item expires.
The strength of the hallowing determines how difficult it is to remove or replace.
## Removal
* A hallowing on a bonded [[Magic|magic]] item lasts for as long as the item retains its properties.
* A hallowing on a mundane item lasts for a year.
* The hallow skill can be used to remove an existing hallowing.
As with any aura, an item can only be under the effect of one item aura at once. Hallowing an item that is already under the effects of a standard aura [[Will|will]] automatically replace that aura. A strong aura is more difficult to replace - the new hallowing must have a strength at least equal to that of the existing hallowing of the ceremony [[Will|will]] fail.
Any character with the hallow skill (including one who is not dedicated to a Virtue) may attempt to remove an existing hallowing rather than replacing it. In the case of a strong hallowing, the ceremony must still have a strength at least equal to that of the existing aura.
The hallow skill can also be used to remove item auras arising from other sources, including those created by some magical enchantments.
If a bonded [[Magic|magic]] item is reforged, any hallowing present is removed.
## [[True liao|True Liao]]
* True [[Liao|liao]] can be used in place of [[Liao|liao]] to perform the hallow ceremony
* An artefact can ''only'' be hallowed using true liao
* A true item aura allows the use of one additional dose of liao when performing a ceremony
You can use true liao in place of normal liao to hallow an item. This will create a true aura, it can only be replaced or removed using true liao or something of similar power. An artefact ''cannot'' be hallowed except by using true liao to create a true aura.
A true aura on an item allows the character carrying the item to make use of one additional dose of liao whenever they perform a ceremony, allowing them to create effects with greater strength.
