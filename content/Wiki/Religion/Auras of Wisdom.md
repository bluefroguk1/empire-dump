We can gain a lifetime of knowledge, yet never see the [[Wisdom|wisdom]] in it.
## Overview
An [[Aura]] is a persistent spiritual effect on a person, location or item. The auras listed here are created by priests dedicated to the virtue of [[Wisdom]] who use the relevant ceremonial skill. A character who is [[Dedication|dedicated]] to [[Wisdom]] must pick one of the following auras when they perform the relevant ceremony. A priest of [[The Way|the Way]] may also use the [[#Dreams of Wisdom|Dreams of Wisdom]] when they use the [[Dedication|dedication]] ceremony to provide a pilgrim with a visionary [[Dedication#Dreams|dream]].
The names used for each [[Aura|aura]] are simply the most common ones used in the Empire. For example, the [[#The Worth of Wisdom|Worth of Wisdom]] may be called ''The Fork in the Road'' by a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Varushka religious beliefs|wise one]]. This is especially true with those auras that are named after paragons and exemplars; all these auras would have had different names before the exceptional individual they are named for was recognised by the Synod.  The [[#The Hallowing of Avigliana|Hallowing of Avigliana]] for example was commonly called the ''[[Hallow]] of the Messenger'' before Avigliana's [[Recognition|recognition]] as an exemplar of [[Wisdom]].
Study of these auras helped the founders of [[The Way|the Way]] to create the Path of Wisdom. Some lay persons assume that the [[Imperial Synod]] created these auras in some fashion to encourage adherence to orthodoxy, but according to theological scholars the situation is the other way around. The auras came first, then the tenets of the Path of Wisdom.
## [[Anointing]]
[[Anointing]] involves a short ceremony to create a [[Aura#Personal Aura|personal aura]] on a mortal being. [[Anointing]] always requires the  consent of the subject.
### The Worth of Wisdom
* ''You feel driven to make a decision and act on it - you are painfully aware that if you do nothing the situation can only get worse.''
Description: The Path of Wisdom teaches that "the virtuous apply what they have learned; Wisdom knows all knowledge is incomplete". Priests of the Path of Wisdom are able to use this [[Anointing|anointing]] to stir those who have become mired in contemplation or the acquisition of knowledge to test and apply that knowledge and gain wisdom. This anointing has also been applied to citizens and pilgrims who face difficult decisions, or are hesitating from taking action.
### The Focus of Wisdom
* ''You feel driven to find a practical solution to the problem you named when anointed. Digressions, fanciful suggestions, and unworkable ideas infuriate you.''
Description: One of the core axioms of the virtue states that "Wisdom is not always knowing the answer; Wisdom is finding the right question". The virtue is not about accruing ever more information, rather it emphasizes the importance of using the crucial knowledge to apply practical solutions to problems. Priests of Wisdom use this [[Aura|aura]] to remind pilgrims of the importance of focussing their search for knowledge on the essential facts needed to overcome challenges.
### The Clarity of Wisdom
* ''You feel an urge to express your ideas and opinions clearly and concisely. You find it difficult to tolerate those who ignore the facts.''
Description: The pilgrim who follows the Path of Wisdom understands the benefits of sharing facts and understanding with others. As well as enabling others to act wisely, helping others gain [[Insight|insight]] may be the most effective way to use the knowledge the pilgrim has gained. However priests often remind the virtuous to "let every word you speak carry meaning; do not use forty when four will do." Effective communication requires simple, short communication of the essential ideas, not rambling or grandstanding. Priests of Wisdom use this [[Aura|aura]] to remind pilgrims of these ideas, as well as helping those who struggle to find the confidence to speak out about what they know.
### The [[Challenge]] of Wisdom
* ''You feel an urge to test your knowledge, discarding anything that falls short. A good decision depends on good understanding.''
Description: Assumptions and inherited knowledge can be dangerous obstacles on the Path of Wisdom. The Path of Wisdom teaches pilgrims to "test what you learn; only fools accept hearsay as truth". The Empire is filled with misinformation and falsehoods, often promulgated by people who have not applied critical reasoning to the things they have been told. Priests of Wisdom use this anointing to encourage pilgrims to examine the things they have heard, to try to separate the wheat from the chaff by identifying what is likely to be true from pure fiction.
Having grey hair doesn't make you wise.
## [[Consecration]]
[[Consecration]] is the ceremony used to create an [[Aura#Location Aura|aura on a clearly defined location]]. There is only one aura for each virtue, and all priests create the same one when they use this skill.
### Dagger of the Mind
* ''You have a profound sense that nothing is impossible. You feel you can solve any problem if you ask the right question.''
Description: This powerful aura of Wisdom fills those who experience it with an uplifting sense that they can overcome any obstacle if they find the right approach. The aura helps pilgrims focus on the challenges they face and inspires them to seek new solutions.
## [[Dedication]]
[[Dedication]] is the ceremony used to link a pilgrim's soul to the virtue. It can also be used to create vivid oracular dreams.
### Dreams of Wisdom
* ''The next time you sleep you experience a vivid dream concerning the problems you are facing. The dream will often show those experiences and moments that revealed information about the challenges you are now facing and sometimes you see yourself acting on that information or seeking out new information. Sometimes the vision will include new problems or mysteries - these seem pressing and important in the dream even if you have never considered them before. The dream will often include individuals you know offering advice or information that helps you in the dream though it is hard to recall the details of what was said or done later.
## [[Hallow]]
[[Hallow]] is used to create an [[Aura#Item Aura|aura on an item]], such as a weapon, implement, shield or suit of armour. It is not possible to use [[Hallow|hallow]] to create an aura on large immobile objects. Hallows do not provide a source of supernatural strength, but are durable and can last for a year (or potentially forever in the case of an artefact hallowed with [[Liao#true liao|true liao]]).
### Hallowing of the Questor
* ''You feel an urge to question received wisdom and determine how trustworthy that information is.''
### Hallowing of the Strategist
* ''You feel an urge to appreciate the bigger picture. The needs of individuals pale besides the greater good.''
### Hallowing of Chastisement
* ''You feel an urge to chastise fools, and those who spread folly or use hindsight to criticize others' wisdom. ''
### Hallowing of the Volhov
* ''You feel driven to find problems to solve and to ignore anyone who tells you to mind your own business.''
### Hallowing of the Stormcrow
* ''You feel an urge to listen to others when they speak about the things they know.''
### Hallowing of the Magistrate
* ''You feel a urge to trust your [[Judgement|judgement]], and act according to the information you have now.''
### Hallowing of Avigliana
* ''You feel a desire to spread ideas, sharing your experiences, knowledge, and insights with others.''
