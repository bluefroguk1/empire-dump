Title: Liao

## Overview
[[Liao]] is a purple powder that is used in [[Religious skills|ceremonial rites]] performed by Imperial priests.
[[Liao]] is made from ''vinum''. Vinum is a white sap that was discovered by the [[Navarr]] to form a chewable confection that aids with deep, restful and dreamless sleep; and was often used to treat nightmares and night terrors. Refining vinum to produce [[Liao|liao]] is a costly and time-consuming process. In the Empire, the civil service purchases large amounts of vinum, and processes it to create liao which is then provided to everyone who ministers to a [[Congregation]] [[Resource#Personal Resource|personal resource]]. Thanks to centuries of experience and improvement the civil service are able to produce liao quite efficiently for a fraction of the cost that any individual could make it.
## Cards
* Liao is indicated using a card
* Rip the card on use
Liao is indicated by a small card (85mm x 55mm), printed by Profound Decisions, that indicates the presence of the liao and includes the rules for using it. 
To use liao to perform a ceremony, it can be:
* burned as incense and inhaled
* mixed with oil and used to anoint someone
* mixed into liquid and imbibed
* mixed into a small capsule and consumed
An appropriate phys-rep for liao is a small bottle or vial, such as might be used to hold a dose of liquid or powder.
### Effects
Consuming liao without the use of a [[Religious skills|ceremony]] causes a human to experience vivid, striking dreams the next time they sleep. An [[Orc]] who consumes a dose of liao merely becomes dizzy and unwell, and often throws up shortly afterwards.
## True Liao
*Also known as ''pure liao'' and ''Imperial liao''
During the maturing process that turns vinum into liao, around one dose in ten thousand matures to a radiant purple. This has come to be known as true liao, or Imperial liao. True liao is extremely rare, powerful, and valuable. The amount of pure liao produced each season varies; it has proved impossible to predict which doses of liao will mature into true liao.  The most common use for true liao is to provide a human with a special vision of another time and place, which is held to be one of their [[Past life vision|past lives]]. There are several other uses, however. It can also be used in place of ceremonial liao to significantly empower the effect of a [[Religious skills|religious skill]], or used in the creation of an [[Inspirational location]], for example.
Normal ceremonial liao is well known to make orcs mildly unwell and produce no notable spiritual effects that anyone has ever been able to distinguish. True liao, as essentially a stronger version of ceremonial liao, is likely to produce stronger side effects: whether these would be sufficient to kill the orc or simply make them very unwell is not known, nor has anyone ever seen fit to use a dose of the rarest substance in the Empire for such a potentially fatal investigation.
### Assignment
The amount of true liao produced each season varies but it is the rarest substance in the Empire. [[The Throne]] is given the first portion as one of their [[The Throne#The Gift of Liao|Powers of Virtue]]. The second portion is auctioned to the highest bidder as part of the [[Auction of the Seats]]; the proceeds are added to the [[Imperial Synod|Synod's]] [[Rewarding|Virtue Fund]]. A third portion, available through the auspices of the [[Lepidean Librarian#Lepidean University|Lepidean Library]], is distributed by the [[Imperial Synod]] using the [[Judgement]] of [[Rewarding]]. All additional portions are allocated by the [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]], representing the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Virtue assemblies]] of the [[Imperial Synod]].
Upon receiving the right to a dose of true liao, either through winning the auction or by acclaim of the gatekeepers, the dose can be claimed directly from the [[Tribune of the Synod]]. As soon as the dose is claimed, it becomes the rightful property of that citizen; they can do what they wish with the dose.
Some actions taken with True Liao remain illegal, however - the Senate [[Outlaw foreign True Liao trade|outlawed]] trading the sacred substance with non-Imperial citizens, and uses of it can still be condemned as [[Religious crime#Abuse of Powers|abuse of powers]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
### True Liao in Play
*True liao is required to create a [[Past life vision|past life vision]]
*Some commissions require a dose of true liao to complete
*A dose of true liao can be used in any ceremony
*Occasionally opportunities require a dose of true liao
Under most circumstances, the phys-rep for true liao is provided by Profound Decisions. It is identifiable as a purple bottle bearing a ''true liao'' special item ribbon. The phys-rep should be returned to GOD once the item is used. 
One of the most common uses for true liao is providing someone with a [[Past life vision]]. If the owner wishes to use the dose for a vision then it should be given over to the Tribune of the Synod at least one event in advance.
The permanent auras created by the use of true liao can exert a powerful and long-lasting influence. Certain permanent religious structures, such as the [[Inspirational location]] of an exemplar or paragon, require a dose of true liao to sanctify them. There may additionally be [[Opportunity|opportunities]] that arise via the winds of fortune that can only be fulfilled by the use of a dose of true liao.
### True Liao and Ceremonies
*Any [[Aura|aura]] created using true liao is both [[Aura#Durable Auras|durable]] and [[Aura#Strong Auras|strong]]
True liao can be used in place of common liao to perform any [[Religious skills|liao ceremony]].
