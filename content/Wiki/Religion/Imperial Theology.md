We are Travellers on [[The Way|the Way]].
Our spirits are immortal;
They have endured before and [[Will|will]] again.
We follow in the footsteps of the paragons,
Who showed humanity the Paths of Virtue.
By uniting the Paths and creating [[The Synod|the Synod]],
The [[First Empress]] showed us [[The Way]].
Across the Labyrinth of Ages, the Virtues [[Guide|guide]] our spirits.
We shall not surrender our destiny to inhuman powers.
[[Death is not the end]] of our journey.
With each generation, Virtue makes us stronger.
Until as paragons we shall conquer Death itself.
## Introduction
For the average citizen of [[The Empire|the Empire]], it is sufficient to know the seven Virtues and how they apply to your life so that your passage through the Labyrinth of Ages can be swift and assured and you can be reborn stronger. Even simple lay [[Preachers|preachers]] of [[The Way|the Way]] need not concern themselves with the subtleties and complexities of the Imperial religion.
However, for many senior priests within the [[Synod]], as well as keen scholars, the foundations of the faith are a source of much discussion, debate and analysis. Senior clergy of the Synod may be asked about their opinion on key points of contention.
