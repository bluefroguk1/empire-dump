## The Path of [[Ambition]]
Though many citizens associate the Virtue of [[Ambition]] with an eye on a [[Senator|senator]]’s seat or even the Imperial [[Throne]], this path embraces many subtler expressions also. The artisan who aspires to create something never before seen; the merchant who strives to be wealthier than any other; the youth who aspires to forbidden love – all may be guided by [[Ambition]] to turn their dreams to reality. There are as many Ambitions as there are citizens who can dream of them, though not all possess the strength of purpose, character and [[Will|will]] to pursue the Path of [[Ambition]] to its fullest, for the [[Cost|cost]] of doing so is often high.
### Guidance on the Path
Through meditation on the [[Auras of Ambition]], and study of the lives of [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]], the priests of [[The Way|the Way]] have gleaned [[Insight|insight]] into the heart of the virtue and how best to pursue it. There are collections of parables, tales, sayings and teachings that distil this for Imperial citizens to learn from. The following are a handful of teachings and sayings deemed to be essential to understanding the path:
* Aim high; pursue your dreams; nothing is beyond your grasp.
* Even the most impenetrable [[Forest|forest]] may fall one tree at a time.
* Consequences are the price of [[Ambition]]; no price is too high to realise your dreams.
* It is better, by far, to try and fail, than fail to try.
* Despise the [[Weakness|weakness]] that comes from pettiness and lack of vision.
## [[Paragons and Exemplars]]
Recognised [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of Ambition include:
* The [[Paragon|paragon]] [[Tian]], who legend claims ascended the highest mountain in all creation to steal fire from the sun.
* The paragon [[Aldones di Sarvos]], one of the founders of [[The League|the League]].
* The exemplar [[Atuman]] of the Highborn, who led his people to the shores of [[Highguard]].
* The exemplar [[Adelmar the Lion]], founder of the School of Arms and an inspiration to weapon masters throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]].
## Symbols of Ambition
One of the most  common symbols of Ambition used in [[The Empire|the Empire]] is flame. This is not only symbolic of the quest [[Tian]] undertook to steal the fire of the sun, but fire possesses many of the qualities of purest ambition. It is ever hungry and never satisfied, for the moment it is satisfied, it dies. Some pilgrims of Ambition even go as far as to burn a [[Brand|brand]] on their arm or hand in [[Recognition|recognition]] of the price [[Tian]] paid or as a reminder of how dangerous Ambition can be.
In [[Wintermark]], ambition is often signified by a rook, while in [[Varushka]] the virtue is associated with the cunning fox, and (in recent times) the wily hare. The [[Rune|rune]] [[Naeve]], which represents hunger, is used by some magicians as a symbol of Ambition.
For obvious reasons [[The Throne|the throne]] is a common symbol associated with ambition - indeed the physical throne that stands in the [[Imperial Senate]] is sometimes seen as one of the most profound symbols of ambition in [[The Empire|the Empire]] representing as it does the most potent [[Imperial Title]]. For similar reasons, a crown (along with other regalia of high office) is sometimes used as a symbol of ambition in [[Dawn]]. This image no doubt originated as a reference to the old monarchs of that nation, and later the actual Imperial crown worn by every Throne since the foundation of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
[[The Mountain|The mountain]] is also sometimes used as a symbol of ambition, or rather of the obstacles one must overcome to achieve one's goals. [[Tian]] climbs a mountain, after all, in her pursuit of fire. In [[Urizen]] the astronomantic [[Constellation|constellation]] of [[The Mountain]] is sometimes used as an icon of ambition representing as it does the universal [[Law|law]] that ''things are not easy''. In a similar vein, in some parts of [[The League]], the ladder is used as a slightly tongue-in-cheek icon of ambition, most likely having its roots in the rambunctious street-dramas of [[Tassato]] and [[Sarvos]]. 
During the [[Spring]] festival celebrated in [[Urizen]], Ambition is represented by a purple flower.
