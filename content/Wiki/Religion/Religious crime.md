## [[Religious Crimes]]
### Abuse of Powers
The crime of abuse of powers is defined as: ''The misuse, or abuse, of the powers of a priest. This includes the powers of [[The Synod|the Synod]], as well as [[Liao|liao]] ceremonies.''
The [[Synod]] is charged with ensuring the proper [[Conduct|conduct]] of all priestly Imperial citizens, whether they are Synod members or not. Abuse of Synod powers includes looking to use [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]] and [[Clemency|clemency]] to pervert [[The Law|the law]], rather than promote virtue. Abuse of priest ceremonies may include use of the [[Excommunication|excommunication]] ceremony on an Imperial citizen without them having first been excommunicated by the Synod.
### Blasphemy
The crime of blasphemy is defined as: ''The denigration of the paragons and the paths of virtue. This includes promoting false virtues and the teachings of false exemplars or false paragons.''
The Feast of the Broken Wheel held by the [[Freeborn]] is contentious and considered blasphemy by some. The festival itself cannot be prosecuted, but a number of Freeborn participants have suffered [[Condemnation|condemnation]] over the years when their antics were judged to have [[Gone|gone]] too far. As Magistrate Enzo i Contero i [[Riqueza]] once noted, [[Imperial Law|Imperial law]] still holds - no matter what celebration you may be attending.
### Desecration
The crime of desecration is defined as: ''The removal of spontaneously created virtuous auras such as legacies of ascendance to paragonhood. This includes such auras arising on areas and objects, and those people who do not wished them removed.''
When this crime was originally created in [[Autumn]] 377, it did not specify "virtuous" and could thus apply to spontaneous auras of false virtues. However, it has been noted that as a [[Religious crime|religious crime]], it would never be prosecuted unless the Synod were to uphold a suitable [[Judgement]] of Condemnation in respect of such an act.
### Heresy
The crime of heresy is defined as: ''The willful rejection, or perversion of, the orthodox [[Doctrines of the Faith]] as laid down by the [[Imperial Synod]], or actively teaching and promoting false doctrines.''
The Synod does permit the discussion, and debate, of the doctrines, and potential variations thereof, as part of theological investigation and learning. The criminal act is the teaching of “truth” that has not been recognized as such by the Synod. Virtuous priests are admonished to seek to change doctrine in the Synod, rather than undermine it.
### Idolatry
The crime of idolatry is defined as: ''Subsuming human [[Will|will]] and destiny to any inhuman entity or force. This includes the worship, veneration or exaltation of any such being or power.''
This crime incorporates the worship of "gods", eternals and other supernatural beings, though some priests have considered applying it in a political context as well.
Anger radiated from Garath, filling the tent in which he was sat. [[The Sentinel]] by the doorway tensed in response. Conversely, Casia, her black-eyes unblinking, appeared entirely unpeturbed and gently stroked her barbels as she considered the [[Broker|broker]].
“This is a travesty, and a waste of time,” spat Garath, “Do you really have nothing better to do with your time, fendweller?”
Casia merely considered him in silence.
“You had no right to haul me in like some criminal!” Gareth railed, “I was in the middle of an important trade deal. You’ve [[Cost|cost]] me a lot of money and I’ll have every ring of it out of your sodden hide.”
The [[Merrow|merrow]] [[Illuminate]] simply lifted her cup and drank from it. Taking her time to finish it if full, she turned again to Garath. Rising from her seat she circled his seat before she finally spoke.
“I’m curious,” she said, without irony, “I have spoken at length to some of your [[Business|business]] partners. You are a successful trader, there is no doubt. Yet the part that I do not understand is what you do with the [[Liao|liao]] you purchase from the Bloodhammer legion. No one I have spoken to reports you ever selling any of it.”
Garath snarled, “Is that it? My cousin Gwyn is a [[Guide]]. I provide it to him as part of the work of the Faith. Go and ask him.”
Casia nodded, and paused to produce a notebook in which the name was carefully inscribed. As she was putting her pen away, the tent flapped jostled and another [[Sentinel]] entered carrying a bag.
Garath blanched, “That’s [[Mine|mine]]! You’ve no right…”
“I think you [[Will|will]] find that priests of the Synod have the right to go a great many places,” Casia interrupted calmly, as she took the bag from the armed man. Reaching in she produced a handful of small documents.
“Oh my,” she said, her tone unchanged despite the expression of surprise, “I do believe I have seen some of these in the tavern. Leaflets extolling the [[Glory|glory]] of Elora, Goddess of Hope.”
The black eyes fixed themselves on Garath again, “I do believe that’s heresy, blasphemy and idolatry in one single stroke. Thank you for your time Broker Garath, your [[Inquisition|inquisition]] is concluded. I would suggest you do not make any plans to leave [[Anvil]] as I am quite sure the [[Magistrates|magistrates]] will be wanting a word.”
As Garath rose, Casia gestured and the two Sentinels moved to either side of him. Garath glared at his shadows, but said nothing as he left the tent with the two following him.
