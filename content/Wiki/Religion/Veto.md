[[Synod]] [[Judgement]] Summary|General [[Assembly]], [[Assembly]] of Nine|Greater Majority
## Overview
[[The Synod]] is charged with ensuring the virtuous behavior of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Because the decisions of the [[Imperial Senate]] are crucial to the soul of [[The Empire|the Empire]], the [[General]] Assembly has the authority to [[Veto|veto]] one [[Senate motion]] or [[Senate announcement]] each summit. This allows them to act as a check and balance on the power of [[The Senate|the Senate]], throwing out decisions that are corrupt, unvirtuous or otherwise offend the moral turpitude.
Any [[Senate motion]] that requires a constitutional vote to pass may be vetoed by the [[General Assembly]] or by the Assembly of Nine. The [[Veto|veto]] always requires the [[Greater majority|greater majority]] to pass - but the Synod may veto any number of constitutional votes.
The Synod shall ensure the virtuous behaviour of the Empire.

## [[Judgement]]
Any [[Member of the Synod|member of the Synod]] may submit a judgement of veto. The judgement must specify a single successful motion that has passed the [[Senate]] that summit, or one [[Senate announcement]] that was made that summit, and must be submitted before the start of the [[Senate session]] after it was passed or announced. It is not possible to veto a motion or announcement before it has been passed by the Senate.
The Synod may only veto one normal motion or announcement per summit. It is possible for different Synod members to submit judgements to veto different motions or announcements; but judgements of veto that cannot legally pass are cancelled at the moment where the first judgement achieves primacy.
If an Assembly rejects a judgement to veto a Senate motion or announcement - then it may not reconsider this judgement later. It is not possible to submit a second judgement of veto to veto the same senate motion or announcement.
When a judgement of veto is submitted, the Tribune is responsible for informing the [[Senator|senator]] who raised the motion, or the individual who made the announcement. Usually they [[Will|will]] send a messenger to find the citizen to ask them to attend the Hub so that they can be briefed on the development. 
A judgement of veto always requires a greater majority to pass.
## Timing
If the [[Imperial Synod]] submits a judgement of veto for a motion - then implementation of the motion [[Will|will]] not proceed until voting has concluded. To ensure the smooth running of the Senate, a veto must be submitted at the same summit where the motion was passed and before the start of the next [[Senate session]].
Most citizens begin to depart [[Anvil]] once the final Senate session concludes. Since the judgement must be submitted at the summit where the motion was passed, the Tribune allows members of the Synod to request a veto after the final Senate session has taken place. If a judgement of veto is submitted to a civil servant then the motion will not pass into [[Law|law]] until the Synod has had time to consider their judgement.
Although it is rare for a Tribune to be present in the Senate during the final session, it is technically legal for ''any'' civil servant to accept a judgement. Traditionally this is accomplished by a citizen calling out from the gallery or the floor that they ''intend to seek the veto''. A civil servant will find the citizen to confirm that they are a [[Member of the Synod|member of the Synod]] who has not yet used their judgement this summit. If that is the case, they will accept the judgement and the pass the details to the Tribune for judgement before the first voting deadline at the following summit.
A small leak will sink a great ship.
## Outcome
If the Synod passes a judgement of veto, then the Senate motion is struck down.
The motion does not pass into law - and furthermore the Senate may not pass another motion which is the legal equivalent again that summit. They may pass a motion on the same issue provided that it contains substantive legal differences to the motion that was vetoed. This assessment is made by [[Scrutiny]] by the Constitutional Court - who have a reputation for respecting the expressed wishes of the Synod in this matter.
The [[Conscience of the Senate]] is responsible for announcing vetoes to the Senate. The [[Speaker for the Senate]] will invite the Synod to speak and inform the Senate of their decision at the start of the next summit. Usually the Conscience will make the announcement themselves, but the Speaker will usually allow the Conscience to invite another member of the Synod to speak in their place if they wish. 
If the Synod rejects a judgement of veto, then that assembly they may not raise another judgement to reconsider the matter, though it may still be judged by another assembly if appropriate.
