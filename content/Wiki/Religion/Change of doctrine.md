[[Synod]] [[Judgement]] Summary|General Assembly|Greater Majority
## Overview
[[The Doctrines of the Faith]] are the foundational pillars of the Imperial faith and [[The Way]]. They represent the distilled [[Wisdom|wisdom]] and knowledge Synod priests across the ages in statements. In essence, the doctrines define the Imperial Religion and the beliefs that it imparts as part of teaching a virtuous life to the citizens of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
The wilful rejection, or perversion of, [[The Doctrines of the Faith|the Doctrines of the Faith]], or actively teaching and promoting False Doctrines is defined as heresy, which is a [[Religious crime|religious crime]]. Consequently, what is, and is not, doctrine and the wording of those doctrines, is an ongoing debate within the [[Imperial Synod]]. It is also the means by which definitive answers are provided to settle religious debates and controversies.
Given the significance of doctrine, only the majority support of the [[General]] [[Assembly]] can add, remove or amend [[Doctrines of the Faith|doctrines of the faith]]. This requires a [[Greater majority|greater majority]] of the [[General Assembly]]. 
"...that I maintain that there is a pressing need for a Doctrine of Inclusionism that [[Will|will]] settle the question of the Eternals and their right and proper role in the creation we all share.
## [[Judgement]]
Any [[Member of the Synod|member of the Synod]] may submit a [[Judgement|judgement]] to change doctrine. There is no legal requirement for clarity but the Tribune [[Will|will]] encourage a priest to use simple, lucid [[Language|language]] that makes the new doctrine clear and to avoid [[Confusion|confusion]]. It is common for a [[Change of doctrine|change of doctrine]] to need a great deal of [[Scrutiny]] so most priests [[Will|will]] choose the final voting deadline of a summit to ensure that there is time for [[The Synod|the Synod]] to discuss the change in detail.
A [[Judgement|judgement]] of [[Change of doctrine|change of doctrine]] requires a greater majority to pass.
Beware of a door that has too many keys.
## Outcome
If the [[Judgement|judgement]] is successful, then the [[Change of doctrine|change of doctrine]] becomes a formal part of the Imperial faith and gains the backing of [[Imperial Law]].
If a judgement is rejected, then in theory there is no [[Change of doctrine|change of doctrine]]. Although it does not have any legal standing, such a rejection is often commonly interpreted as a rejection of the virtue and validity of the proposed idea. For example, a failure to change doctrine to recognize that orcs have souls does not legally imply that orcs do not have souls - but [[Will|will]] be commonly interpreted as such by many Imperial citizens if the [[Change of doctrine|change of doctrine]] was decisively rejected by the Synod.
Even more so than a [[Statement of Principle]], a change of doctrine can have significant implications for [[The Empire|the Empire]], and for followers of [[The Way|the Way]] across the known world. Due to their shared faith, the priests of the [[Sumaah Republic]] pay particular attention to changes of doctrine by the Synod. There are priests who support congregations that follow [[The Way|the Way]] in many [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]], and they tend to look to either [[The Empire|the Empire]] or [[Sumaah]] for guidance on religious matters. A significant change of doctrine may be accepted or refuted by priests in other nations, but whatever else happens it [[Will|will]] not be ignored.
