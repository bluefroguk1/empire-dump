Title: Congregation

## Overview
A [[Congregation|congregation]] can represent almost any structure or location where people could receive spiritual instruction, such as a monastery, a church, a sacred grove, a burial site, or similar structure. It provides the owner with [[Liao]] and votes to use in the [[Imperial Synod]]
## Production
A [[Congregation|congregation]] entitles the owner to ten votes and the ability to raise a [[Judgement]] in the [[Imperial Synod]]. In addition the Imperial civil service will provide the owner with five doses of [[Liao|liao]].
The owner can use their votes on each [[Judgement|judgement]] in every [[Assembly]] they are a member of. By default every [[Congregation|congregation]] owner is a member of the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]] as well as the [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|national assembly for their nation]].
If your character is [[Dedication|dedicated]] to a virtue then by default they will be a member of that [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Virtue Assembly]]. If they are not dedicated then they will be a member of the [[Assembly]] of [[The Way|the Way]]. This can be changed by [[#Downtime Options|preaching]].
Demand for [[Liao]]
Only two nations - the Empire and the [[Sumaah Republic]] - produce [[Liao]] in any great quantity, and the Sumaah are loathe to allow too much of it to fall into the hands of heathens and heretics. There is a significant demand for the spiritual substance in a number of places, however. The [[Construct Temple of the Way in Nemoria|temple of the Seven Virtues]] in [[Asavean Archipelago ports#Nemoria|Nemoria]] means that the novelty-seeking Asaveans are even more interested in acquiring the drug than usual. Several nations make use of the [[Liao|liao]] in their own spiritual rites - the [[Faraden]] and the [[Axos|Axou]] in particular. Others look to exploit the mild narcotic properties of liao, or to trade on its exotic reputation - merchants from the [[Sarcophan Delves]] in particular are keen to buy crates of the purple substance to sell to select markets abroad.
Yet the Empire's stock of liao is carefully regulated, distributed to [[Congregation|congregations]] based on their size. With a few exceptions, the liao that is so much in demand must be purchased directly from Imperial priests. At the moment, any Imperial citizen who leads a congregation can sell their liao for a crown each dose, either to entrepreneurial Imperial traders or directly to foreign merchants. This opportunity, however, remains dependent on the shifting relationships between the Empire and foreign nations.
## Downtime Options
It is possible to sell the liao produced by a congregation. You receive one crown for each dose of liao that you sell in this way.
it is also possible to ''preach'' in downtime to change which [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Virtue assembly]] your character belongs to. You can choose to select a virtue from the ''preach'' dropdown menu, which will set your membership of a Virtue [[Assembly|assembly]] for the next event. This setting initially defaults to the virtue the character is [[Dedication|dedicated]] to (if any). If it is changed, that change remains in place unless the option is changed again. The only options available are the seven Imperial virtues and [[The Way|the Way]] (for preaching that does not focus on a specific virtue), regardless of the character's [[Dedication|dedication]].
Membership of an [[Assembly|assembly]] is set before the start of the event based on the preceding downtime; membership of an assembly will never change at the summit. Assessment of qualification for the benefits of [[Great work|great works]] and the like is made at the end of Downtime, after the character has had an opportunity to preach.
A character who is dedicated to a force other than one of the seven Virtues defaults to membership of the Assembly of [[The Way|the Way]]. This does not change, but they have the same option to declare themselves a member of a virtue assembly as any other character.
## Upgrades
A congregation can be upgraded using [[White granite]] obtained from the Bourse. Each time a congregation is upgraded, the owner receives two additional votes in the Synod and one additional dose of liao from then on.
To upgrade a congregation requires Imperial Wains of white granite equal to the level the congregation is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 congregation costs 2 Imperial Wains of white granite, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial Wains, etc.
## Diversification
A congregation cannot be diversified.
## National Implications
Senators in Highguard are chosen by the Highborn National Assembly on the basis of who gets the least votes against them. This vote is a normal Synod vote - but only Highborn characters with a congregation personal resource can vote.
## Rituals
The table below shows a list of the rituals in both Imperial lore and Urizen lore which can affect the production of a congregation.
