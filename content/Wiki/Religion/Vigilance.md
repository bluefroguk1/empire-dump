## The Path of [[Vigilance]]
The Virtue of [[Vigilance]] is popular amongst those charged with ensuring the safety of things precious; from the [[Inquisitor|inquisitor]] who seeks out treacherous cultists, to the [[Scrivener|scrivener]] who scrutinises their [[Dhomiro|dhomiro]]’s records against fraud and theft, to the shepherds in the fields. The threats to [[The Empire|the Empire]] and its citizens are many and varied and all must be prepared for, guarded against and actively opposed lest they tear down civilisation. Not all threats carry arms like the [[Barbarians|barbarians]]; some come with smiles and lies, like false-faced eternals, or even lie in the hearts of weak citizens. Through diligence, detail, and [[Dedication|dedication]] in all things does one person’s [[Vigilance]] safeguard another from harm.
### Guidance on the Path
Through meditation on the [[Auras of Vigilance]], and by studying the lives of [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]], the priests of [[The Way|the Way]] have gleaned [[Insight|insight]] into the heart of the virtue and how best to pursue it. There are collections of parables, tales, sayings and teachings that distill this for Imperial citizens to learn from. The following are a handful of teachings and sayings deemed to be essential to understanding the path:
* Seek out the poison in your neighbour’s fields, lest your own crops be blighted.
* Be alert to all dangers; within and without.
* Seek out falsehood and expose the truth.
* Prepare for malice, yet thwart malice before it strikes against you.
* Despise that which threatens what you watch over, whether by malice, lies, [[Folly|folly]] or carelessness.
## [[Paragons and Exemplars]]
Attempts to catalogue [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] of [[Vigilance]] have met with mixed success. In some cases, the disaster they prevent or the catastrophe that goes averted results in their [[Heroism|heroism]] going unsung. More notable are those who publicly expose traitors, infiltrators, and black-hearted villains. Recognised [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[Vigilance]] include:
* The legendary [[Paragon|paragon]] known as [[The Sentinel]], who is credited with building many ancient towers and fortresses that still stand today. 
* The paragon [[Vardas]] [[The Witch|the Witch]]-Hunter of [[Varushka]], who dedicated his life to tracking down and bringing to justice the criminals who preyed on his people.
* The exemplar [[Berechiah]] who exemplifies the often unpopular idea that the vigilant should be prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect their people from outside threats.
## Symbols of Vigilance
The tower is a common symbol of Vigilance, representing the ancient works of The [[Sentinel]]. The watchtower allows one to see great distances and prepare for coming threats, while a fortified tower or a castle allow one to protect that which is precious. Along similar lines, other tools of warding and warning are common symbols of the path, especially the bell, the barred [[Gate|gate]], and the beacon. Priests and pilgrims of the Path of Vigilance [[Will|will]] often carry a bell or whistle for precisely the purpose of alerting others to danger they have identified. A lantern is another popular symbol of Vigilance, as is the candle - both can be used to provide aid in dark places and to signal warnings to others.
Mystically inclined [[Urizen]] favour the unblinking eye (an eye without lids). The eye has a great deal of [[Hearth magic|hearth magic]] significance, and is often [[Painted|painted]] onto surfaces such as gates, doors, and the base of heliopticon towers as a reminder of the need to stay alert. During their [[Spring]] festival, they represent Vigilance with green flowers or sometimes wreaths of green leaves. The image of the unblinking eye can also be seen in the basilisk, a common symbol for unsleeping Vigilance among the Highborn.
In [[Varushka]], eyes or grim faces are often carved into lintels or trees to keep watch over a vale; there are several stories of warnings being delivered in dreams to those who sleep in a house guarded by these peculiar icons. A similar role is played by the scarecrow (and to a degree the traditional poppet) in [[The Marches]].
The spear also stands as a symbol of Vigilance, especially among the [[Navarr]] where it has strong connotations of protecting against outside threats.
Among the people of [[Wintermark]] Vigilance is represented by the loud jay and by the goose. The goose is also used as a symbol of the virtue in [[Varushka]], alongside the wise spider. [[The Spider|The spider]] also serves as a symbol of Vigilance among some covert sects in [[Urizen]], specifically as the astronomantic [[Constellation|constellation]] of the same name. [[The Law|The law]] of the Spider - ''things are watched by a hidden eye'' - is both a statement of the need to be constantly alert for danger and a reminder that others are always watching. Some magicians use the [[Rune|rune]] of Revelation, [[Ophis]], as a symbol of vigilance.
