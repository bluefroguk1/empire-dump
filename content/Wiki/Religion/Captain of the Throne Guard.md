It was built to support, train and inSpire members of [[The Throne]] Guard, and funded by the House of Seven Mirrors - the [[Guild]] of [[Empress Lisabetta]]. Construction and planting of the surrounding gardens was completed shortly after the 383YE Summer Solstice.

## The Vigilant Shield
This comfortable manor house is situated close enough to the Silent Sentinel to hear if its massive Warning bell ever rings out to call Imperial citizens to vigilant defence. But unlike that [[Fortification]], the manor house has been designed with pleasing proportions, bearing a passing resemblance to the Rose Towers in [[Semmerholm]]. 
In the heart of the main house lies [[The Oak]]-panelled chapel, adorned with portraits of [[Paragons and Exemplars]], primarily of [[Vigilance]] and [[Loyalty]]. In [[Pride]] of place is a lectern upon which rests an Illuminated scroll, setting out the names and affiliations of fallen Throne Guard.
The manor house is surrounded by flower gardens, ornamented with statuary Commissioned from artists of all nations of [[The Empire]], and threaded through with a pergola walkway reminiscent of cloisters. The plants have been chosen carefUlly such that The Gardens are in bloom for most of the year, yet can withstand the extremes of weather often experienced this close to Anvil. It is a haven in colourful shades of gold, green, white and violet, and often sparkles with silver raindrops.
