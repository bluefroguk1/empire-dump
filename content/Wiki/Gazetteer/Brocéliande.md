## Overview
Lush [[Brocéliande]], on the border between [[Dawn]] and [[Highguard]], is considered by the [[Navarr]] as ancestral homeland and is the single largest forested expanse in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. This is where [[Navarr]] and [[Thorn]] first danced. The [[Navarr]] have been unable to make any significant gains in this [[Territory|territory]] against [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]], and there is limited [[Navarr]] presence here.
The majority of [[Navarr]] [[Steadings|steadings]] in [[Brocéliande]] are centred around Boar's Dell in the north, and around the Broch in [[Vallorn|vallorn]]-infested Black Boughs. While all steadings [[Fight|fight]] against vallornspawn, those in [[Brocéliande]] generally see the most "action" - especially the Broch situated as it is deep inside the circumference of the [[Brocéliande]] infestation. Green lung is a constant threat in much of [[Brocéliande]].
Much of the interior of the territory is still unknown to modern scholars, both within the Navarr and without. [[The Vallorn|The vallorn]] covers the vast majority of the land here, choking any Terunael ruins or artefacts, and drowning those who venture too far with its powerful, deadly miasma.
## Recent [[History]]
Over the last fifty years, much of the [[Forest|forest]] was infiltrated by [[Barbarian|barbarian]] orc communities settling from [[The Barrens]]. They largely avoided the Navarr, although there were rumours of some limited trade between isolated steadings and [[Groups|groups]] of [[Barbarians|barbarians]]. The orcs in the south were brutally conquered when the [[Druj]] took and held Elereal, but the orcs of [[The Mallum]] made no effort to push for further control of Brocéliande. Indeed, they seemed more interested in keeping the vallornspawn at bay than in engaging with the Navarr.
After the [[Druj]] hold of [[The Barrens|the Barrens]] was temporarily broken, most of the orc settlers retreated out of Brocéliande, leaving their makeshift camps to fall into disuse or be overrun by vallornspawn. They rejoined their original nation - the [[Great Forest Orcs]].
## Major Features
### The Broch
The largest collection of steadings of the Navarr, well-defended and constantly guarded. It is the western edge of the Navarri’s watch on the horrors of Brocéliande. It is both a place of [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]], and a place of [[Ritual|ritual]] where vates gather when necessary to counter specific magical threats. The First Dance [[Steading|steading]] are based in the Broch and seek more than any to investigate new ways to [[Fight|fight]] against the [[Vallorn]]. Few can spend too much time here - even if the danger were not sufficient, there is the ever-present risk of green lung. 
The rise of the Heirs of Terunael left the Broch vulnerable to attack and without the efforts of [[The Empire|the Empire]], and the emissaries of [[Tharim]], it might well have fallen to [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]]'s malice. As it is, the [[Steading|steading]] was seriously damaged and left isolated in the depths of the [[Vallorn|vallorn]]. The Navarr who lived there reached out to the [[Imperial Senate]] for support. Shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice 384YE work was completed on heavily fortifying the Broch, leaving it a place of relative safely in [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]] infested territory.
Buried deep within the miasma at Black Boughs, even with the recent reinforcement the Broch is perhaps the [[Steading|steading]] most at risk of being overrun.
## Regions
### Elerael
Quality: [[Forest]]
Elerael was one of the few regions of Brocéliande initially under Navarr control. The most prominent [[Steading|steading]] here, Eleri’s Stead, was once a comparatively peaceable place, a Navarr counterpart to High Chalcis where [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Forest|forest]] plants were studied. It was swept away as orcs flooded from the [[Forest]] of Peytaht.The orcs were most likely [[Druj]] from [[Reikos]], but it is not clear how much of a presence they still maintain here. Some Navarr scouts have reported an increase in vallornspawn attacks into Elerael, increasing in severity dramatically after the [[Reikos]] [[Trods|trods]] were damaged in 378YE.
Elerael is the home to the large and influential Brackensong [[Steading]] who give sanctuary for those who walk the dangerous Trods that weave through the [[Vallorn]] of Brocéliande.  The Splitroot [[Striding]] use Elerael to walk the trods into Dark Ranging where, up until the [[Declaration|declaration]] of [[War|war]] in [[Winter]] 378YE, they were one of the few stridings to trade with the Orcs of [[The Barrens|the Barrens]].
### Black Boughs
Qualities: [[Forest]], [[Vallorn]]
The Broch is a small enclave of safety inside the miasma of [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]].
### Boar's Dell
Quality: Forest
The northernmost region of Brocéliande is the site of Greenstead, a stone-walled steading built with support from Rucastle as [[Dawn]] and the Navarr threw a ring around the dark heart of the forest there. It is often assaulted, but with Dawnish support it has always held. There has long been a bond - and several intermarriages - between the two settlements.   
### Dark Ranging
Qualities: Forest, Vallorn 
Dark Ranging is entirely embraced by the vallorn. In the wake of the defat of the Heirs of Terunael in 383YE, there was a small window of [[Opportunity|opportunity]] during which the vallorn might have been routed, but unfortunately it proved impossible to take advantage of that chance.
### Greenweald
Qualities: Forest, Vallorn 
Greenweald is entirely infested with the vallorn. There are ruins here, but they have proved almost impossible to reach in any more than the most limited way.
### Terunael
Qualities: Forest, Vallorn
This is the heart of the Vallorn in Brocéliande, and the most storied of the ancestral cities of the Navarr. [[The Ruins of Terunael|The ruins of Terunael]] itself - the capital of that ancient empire - lie somewhere here, surrounding the immortal heart of the largest vallorn outside of Visokumo in [[Axos]].
### Vale's Lament
Qualities: Forest, Vallorn 
Between [[Reikos]] to the east and [[Casinea]] to the west, Vale's Lament is entirely infested by the vallorn. From time to time, vallornspawn and even the occasional miasma seeps across the borders into [[Highguard]].
## OOC Note
* As of [[Autumn]] 379YE, the Vallorn occupies Back Boughs, Dark Ranging, Greenweald, Vale's Lament and Terunael. The Navarr (and thus [[The Empire|the Empire]]) holds Boar's Dell and Elerael.
* To claim Brocéliande, [[The Empire|the Empire]] needs to hold four of the seven regions. This is currently impossible without reducing the power of the Vallorn.
* The Broch is a [[Great work]] that splits a bounty of 75 doses of [[Bladeroot]] between every personal [[Resource|resource]] operated by a Navarr character in Brocéliande except for fleets and military units.
