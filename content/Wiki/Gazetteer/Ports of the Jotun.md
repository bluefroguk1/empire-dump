## Overview
There is one port of the [[Jotun]] available to [[Characters|characters]] with the [[Fleet]] [[Resource|resource]]; Kierheim. The fortified port lies halfway along the northern shores of the inland sea known as the Gullet, far to the west of [[Wintermark]], in the part of [[Jotun]] known as Kalsea. 
While the [[Jotun]] are not great [[Traders|traders]], and prefer to do their actual fighting on land, the northern [[Jotun]] have a long tradition of raiding along the shores of the Gullet. There are historical stories of a great navy, used to attack into [[Kallavesa]] and [[Bregasland]] in pre-Imperial days. There are probably other ports along the gullet, but they do not rival Kierheim in wealth or prestige, and their whereabouts and identities are unknown.
Privateering against the [[Jotun]] rarely involves direct attacks on Kierheim - the port is well defended and swarms with both Jotun [[War|war]] vessels and hardened warriors. Normally, an Imperial [[Fleet|fleet]] tries to catch a Jotun vessel on its way out of Kierheim to raid, or returning from an attack against an Imperial settlement or ship, holds full of stolen loot.
Trading with the Jotun is a criminal act, but used to prove quite lucrative before [[The Senate|the Senate]] implemented a network of civil servants to monitor Imperial shipping. It was also quite risky; while the Jotun are peripherally honourable, anyone trying to trade with one of their settlements risks being taken as a thrall and having their goods confiscated if they show the slightest [[Weakness|weakness]].
## Kierheim (Southern Kalsea)
Mighty Kierheim is a walled town with long quays built along the entire side of a great fjord. Ruled by the Jarl of Kierheim, whose [[Family|family]] line stretches back to the earliest days of the Jotun, it is a centre for ship-building and a common anchor for [[War|war]]-ships and the rare Jotun trading vessels. The best-known landmark is the great avenue that leads up to the fortified hall of the Jarl - lined with dozens of massive mammoth [[Tusks|tusks]], each carved with [[Runes|runes]] of strength and [[Prosperity|prosperity]].
Privateering against the Jotun is not as common as privateering against the [[Grendel]] on the [[Bay of Catazar]], but it can be just as lucrative. Rich cargoes of volatile [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and polished [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] are common, as are supplies of the [[Bladeroot]] that grows with great profusion across the cold battlefields of northern Jotun. Furthermore, a canny pirate or unscrupulous trader can acquire all sorts of valuable ores, woods, metal goods, rich furs, fine fiery mead and several exotic [[Herbs|herbs]] and foodstuffs from the Jotun [[Traders|traders]] that fetch a good price in Imperial markets.
Trade here is a risky proposition - not only is it illegal, but there is very little [[Law|law]] beyond the word of the Jarl and their favoured champions. The Jotun rule with an iron fist, and while the line of the Jarls of Kierheim has a reputation for being more subtle than the traditional Jotun this simply makes them more dangerous. Imperial visitors [[Will|will]] turn heads, but humans are not unknown here - like most Jotun settlements, there are human thralls here - many of whom are employed as farmers or merchants by their orc masters. 
### Trade with Kierheim
It is not currently possible to trade with Kierheim; the [[Senate]] has placed civil servants aboard all Imperial ships making this action impossible.
