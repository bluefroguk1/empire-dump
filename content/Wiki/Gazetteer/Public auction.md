* [[Ilium]] seats and the [[Master of the Imperial Mint]] are auctioned at the Spring Equinox
* [[White granite]] seats are auctioned at the Summer Solstice
* [[Mithril]] seats are auctioned at the Autumn Equinox
In addition the two [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave|Bearers of an Imperial Wayleave]] and the [[Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration]] are all auctioned at every summit.
At the end of the Auction of the Seats a single dose of [[Liao#True Liao|true liao]] is auctioned off, with the winning bid contributed to the [[Rewarding|Virtue Fund]],
## Auction sessions
The [[Public auction|public auction]] is held on Saturday, and the timing and location can be found in the [[Event schedule|event schedule]] and on signs around [[Anvil]]. The Senate is the preferred location, but occasionally another meeting or event will take precedence and the auction will move to another suitable location.
### Auctioneer
The proceedings are lead by an auctioneer, who is usually an [[Imperial Civil Service#Agents of the Bourse|Agent of the Bourse]], a member of the Civil Service. Their role is a fine balance of keeping order, ensuring fair access to the auction for all present, and hosting a time-honoured Imperial spectacle.
Another Agent of the Bourse will usually be responsible for recording the the winning bids, taking the money, and giving out the purchased items.
### Participation
All Imperial citizens are eligible to bid in the auction and it is usually a busy and fast-paced affair. Bids are settled using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction#Driven_by_bidders_only an open ascending price auction].
The usual format is as follows:
* The auctioneer reads out the complete list of lots.
* Bidding begins on each item in turn, with the auctioneer suggesting an opening bid if none is forthcoming
* A clear unique bid is taken from the first person seen and heard to give it, and bidding goes up until a winner is determined
* The winner goes immediately to the auction clerk to pay and have their appointment recorded
Bidding is usually in [[Currency|thrones and crowns]]. Only mana crystals are accepted in the auction for the position of [[Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration]]. Citizens are asked to have payment ready when bidding in order to keep things moving smoothly.
