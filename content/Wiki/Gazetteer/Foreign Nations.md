## Overview
Foreigners are people that are not part of [[The Empire|the Empire]], that [[The Empire|the Empire]] is not currently at [[War|war]] with. [[The Empire]] trades with many of these foreign powers, and may host delegations from them. Foreigners have no ability to directly influence the future of [[The Empire|the Empire]], but may have political agendas that [[Guide|guide]] their interaction with the players. The [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Call Winged Messenger]] is often used to communicate with representatives of [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]], and Imperial ambassadors may be appointed to represent [[The Empire|the Empire]] in negotiations with them.
## Foreign Neighbours
Nations that are not part of the Empire but which are not [[Barbarian]] are sometimes called 'local foreigners'. They are smaller than the Empire, and possess a level of influence and military power roughly on par with one or more Imperial nations. They tend to share borders with the Empire, and many are threatened by the same [[Barbarians|barbarians]] that threaten their Imperial neighbours.
They speak the same tongue as the Empire, and engage in limited amounts of trade. This trade does not usually involve fleets; rather it could be represented with a [[Business]], or role-played. Larger scale trades may be entered into but these would be the result of politics with non-player [[Characters|characters]] from the neighbouring nations.
The primary foreign neighbours of the Empire are:
* [[Axos]], a magocratic nation that closed its borders some time ago and is only now beginning to emerge from self-imposed isolation. It lies to the east of [[Urizen]].
* [[Faraden]], a hilly nation of [[Traders|traders]] with a long [[History|history]] of cooperation with the [[Freeborn]] that lies to the west of the Empire.
* The [[Iron Confederacy]], a nation of feudalistic warlords who worship false gods, lying to the south of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]].
* [[Skoura]], a mountainous nation with rich mines and introspective citizens that lies to the south of [[Urizen]].
* The [[Thule]] are dominated by their magicians, and engage in merciless asset-stripping of any lands they invade. They are found across the mountains to the north of [[Varushka]] in an area called [[Otkodov]].
## Distant Foreigners
Distant foreigners primarily exist in [[Downtime|downtime]], although their representatives may attend [[Events|events]] or enter correspondence with Imperial citizens. They represent nations that are on par with the Empire in terms of influence and capability - and in interest in world-wide [[Events|events]]. They are all physically within four or five weeks hard-sailing of the Empire (meaning a [[Fleet]] can reach them and return in a single [[Downtime|downtime]] period; this also means it is largely unfeasible to try and invade them or for them to invade the Empire).
These nations do not speak Imperial as their primay-[[Language|language]] (although many citizens there [[Will|will]] be familiar with the language). A number of other real-world language families are assigned to represent the [[Languages|languages]] of these [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]], and to the smaller independent nations that surround them.
The five primary [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]] active on the world stage as peers of the Empire are:
* The [[Asavean Archipelago]], an old and self-satisfied nation with a taste for luxury.
* The [[Sarcophan Delves]], a ruthless mercantile nation built in the ruins of a fallen civilisation.
* The [[Principalities of Jarm]], a fractious magocracy known for exotic wonders and cut-throat politics.
* The [[Commonwealth]], a comparatively young society founded on the principle of the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
* The [[Sumaah Republic]], a secretive nation that shares the faith of the Empire but rejects [[The Synod|the Synod]]
The list is not exhaustive - there may be other [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]] out there but they are neither important nor active enough to be trading partners for the Empire. There are also extensive nations beyond the "known world" of the Empire campaign - too far away for regular trade to exist with them.
