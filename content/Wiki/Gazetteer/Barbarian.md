## Overview
[[Barbarians]] are people that are not part of [[The Empire|the Empire]], that [[The Empire|the Empire]] is currently at [[War|war]] with.
There are several distinct [[Barbarian|barbarian]] powers which represent hostile nations. The barbarians are designed to look cool in massive numbers in [[Battles|battles]]; to provide immersive, exciting and dramatic [[Combat|combat]] encounters; and to allow a range of interactions outside of [[Combat|combat]]. Most of the [[Barbarian|barbarian]] powers that currently surround [[The Empire|the Empire]] are orcs. 
Players are not able to play [[Barbarian|barbarian]] [[Characters|characters]] - by definition, they are not welcome on the playing field, however everyone has the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to play a [[Barbarian|barbarian]] by volunteering to monster a battle or quest.
## The Orcs
There are a large number of scattered [[Groups|groups]] of orcs, but three of [[The Nations|the nations]] neighbouring [[The Empire|the Empire]] are large enough that they are considered threats to [[The Empire|the Empire]].
* The [[Jotun]] are warlike but honourable, and occupy a large swathe of land to the west of [[Wintermark]] and [[The Marches]].
* The [[Druj]] are a comparatively small nation that uses fear to exert influence over a number of smaller orc nations. They are found in the swamps and forests to the east of [[Dawn]] and [[Highguard]] and known for their treachery and their love of terror-tactics.
* The [[Grendel]] are a sea-faring nation with a love for wealth and power. They hail from Attar and the Broken Shore, lands to the south and east of the [[Bay of Catazar]].
Smaller groups of orcs are scattered across the Empire as bandits, or live outside its borders in numbers. The orcs of the hills between [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] and their foreign neighbours ([[Faraden]] and The [[Iron Confederacy]]) were a case in point.
The orc barbarians are not a monolithic threat - the nations may form temporary alliances, but they sometimes [[Fight|fight]] each other with as much ferocity as they show to the Empire.
