## Overview
There is one port on the Broken Shore known to [[Characters|characters]] with the [[Fleet]] [[Resource|resource]]; Dubhtraig on the northern shores of Attar, the landmass [[On the other side|on the other side]] of the [[Bay of Catazar]]. Dubhtraig - and the Broken Shore as a whole - is dominated by the [[Grendel]]. There are certainly other [[Grendel]] ports in the Broken Shore, but their whereabouts and identities are unknown.
Privateering against the Grendel rarely involves direct attacks of Dubhtraig - the port is well defended and swarms with Grendel vessels and warriors. Normally, an Imperial [[Fleet|fleet]] tries to catch a Grendel vessel on its way from Dubhtraig out into the bay; the best prey are those vessels who are on their way ''back'' to Dubhtraig, holds full of stolen loot.
Trading with the Grendel is a criminal act, but used to prove quite lucrative before [[The Senate|the Senate]] implemented a network of civil servants to monitor Imperial shipping. Unlike many [[Barbarian|barbarian]] nations, the Grendel seemed unconcerned about the idea of trading with Imperial citizens - but they kept a close eye on them to ensure they were not assassins or spies.
## Dubhtraig (Northern Broken Shore)
Sprawling Dubhtraig is dominated by the Grendel and their many subject nations. it is an absolutely wretched hive of scum and villainy, where the strong oppress the weak at the command of the wealthy. Ruled by an utterly ruthless Salt Lord, Dubhtraig appears to be a centre of Grendel trade and piracy - and for their politics, such as they are.
Privateering against Dubhtraig is a common calling of the [[Freeborn]] [[Corsair]] Fleet. The Broken Shore is rich in [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], but most of the profit for a fleet that attacks Grendel vessel comes in the recovery of goods stolen from other [[Traders|traders]] - especially valuable goods such as silk, jewellery, barrels of fine spirits, furs, precious metals and mundane ore. All such luxury goods raise a pretty price for a resolute captain. As with any privateering voyage, a fleet owner [[Will|will]] never know exactly what their production is likely to be in advance. Control of the [[Imperial Bourse]] seat known as the [[Broken Shore Bounty]] is determined by Freeborn fleets raiding the Grendel in the Bay, and along the shores of Attar.
Trade here is a risky proposition - not only is it illegal, but there is very little [[Law|law]] here. The Grendel rule, and the other orcs and humans who throng here jump to obey their commands. Aye, humans - there are humans who consider themselves subjects of the Grendel orcs; misguided fools who view [[The Empire|the Empire]] as their enemy and the orcs as their rightful lords. Still, dangerous as trade in Dubhtraig is, it used to be very profitable before the [[Senate]] took measures to prevent it entirely.
### Trade with Dubhtraig
It is not currently possible to trade with Dubhtraig; the Senate has placed civil servants aboard all Imperial ships making this action impossible.
