## Overview
[[Tromsa]] is a [[Jotun]] territory that lies between [[Skallahn]] and the wastes of Tsirku. West of [[Sermersuaq]] it is broadly unknown territory. Imperial forces invaded the territory after the Summer Solstice 385YE, discovering some details. It is known to be both rugged and Forested, and he weather seems to be cold all year round. It is the seat of the Jarl of Tromsa; Olgaf ANagarsson was an experienced Warrior known for his wildness who was killed by Imperial troops during the invasion. He was succeeded by his daughter, renowned engineer Igya Olgafsdottir.
## Points of Interest
### Lake Karnakadatha
A massive body of water similar to those found in Sermersuaq that lies on the border between the Skyfall Wastes and Tsirku. The waters here are significantly warmer than those in the rest of the Region, and numerous small settlements dot its shores. The main industry here is fishing, but that is not the reason that the Jotun maintains several watchtowers and a force of warriors here. The lake was apparently formed long ages past when the Northern Lights apparently caused a fragment of star to fall and destroy the castle of a Prideful Jarl. Star metal is commonly pUlled from the depths of the lake, or found in the bellies of fish. Some of those fish are apparently very odd indeed. Both strange fish and star metal are sent south, to be used by the Jotun smiths, and are apparently the main reason Skyfall is settled at all.
Lake Karnakadatha is a source of [[Ilium]], although it's not clear how much ilium the lake provides each season.
### ViheltavaThorn (Ruins)
A [[Fortification]] built in Rikskog, destroyed by Imperial forces during the invasion of 385YE. Jarl Olgaf Anagarsson fell here, defending the castle along with Jarl Klarra Sembansscion of Rikskog.
### Oksenesfestsal
The Mountains of Tromsdalen are part of the same range as Eyrarfell, and on their eastern edge stands the ''Oksenesfestsal'', a commanding Fortification that also serve as the seat of the Jarl of Tromsas. The castle is massive – a match for the Castle of Thorns in [[Astolat]] – although there are signs that it has been expanded to its current size only within the last few years. There are also signs that the structure is reinforced with [[Adamant]] – the same almost indestructible stone of the Summer [[Realm]] used in the construction of the Adamant Gate in [[Semmerholm]], or the Court of the White Fountain in [[Redoubt]]. Three high towers surmount a massive curtain wall; the highest fashioned after the horned head of a massive aurochs. Serpentine dragons coil around the other two towers, giving a strong indication that this fort has been constructed in part at least with the aid of the Stone King.
Oksenesfestsal has the unbreakable quality; this means that it cannot be brought below 1,000 strength by mortal means. It can be captured, but not destroyed.
## Regions
Not much is known about the precise layout of the regions of Tromsa; [[The Empire]] does not have a reliable map.
### Icewood
* Qualities: Forest
This sprawling region runs the length of the Sermersuaq border, and was the first region of Tromsa encountered by Imperials. It is a vast wild land whose hills are covered in a cloak of ancient, black-barked trees – pine, fire, beggarwood, and spruce. There are few roads, which poses a Challenge in itself, as do the predatory dire beasts that lurk in the depths of the forest. They mostly flee before large groups of soldiers, but smaller parties of scouts sometimes find themselves in dreadful life-or-death struggles with dire wolves, a behemoth ice bear, or even stranger creatures. The population is mostly thralls in scattered villages who hunt the beasts of the forest – including the immense darkhide dire elk - or gather [[Ambergelt]] and dragonbone from among the trees. The overwhelming majority are orcs - there appear to be very few human thralls in the Icewood. The weather here is very cold; even the Winterfolk are a little unprepared for just how sharp the fangs of these northern winds prove to be.
According to scouts from the [[Bloodcloaks]], there is a peculiar area in the north of the region which is claimed as the domain of ''Fiksuvaris, Raðljóst's Guide'' - possibly a name for the [[Eternal]] [[Wise Rangara]]. The Empire was warned away from that area, and there is speculation it might be a structure similar to a [[Fane]] dedicated to that Winter power
### Skyfall Waste
* Qualities: ''Skyhaunted''
West of Icewood, north of Rikskog, is the Skyfall Waste. A storm-swept tundra where no trees grow, even more sparsely settled than the Icewood. At night the northern lights are clEarly Visible in the clear skies, and it is common year-round to awaken to frost on the ground and flurries of snow. All the orcs encountered here wear sigils, marked with the rune [[Diras]] which they grudgingly explain hide them from the attention of the twisting ribbons of ice, and from the wicked spirits that sometimes come down from the north with the howling winds. Travel far enough north across the Skyfall Waste and one finds Tsirku, and the endless storm of Sydanjaa. Lake Karnakadatha is found here and seems to be the main reason there is ''any'' settlement here.
### Rikskog
* Qualities: None
West of Icewood, south of Skyfall, lies Rikskog. Heavily forested in the east, the region becomes flatter and more open as one travels westward. Thralls tend actual Farms - though the Marchers scoff at the hardscrabble life that amounts to agriculture here. The soil is hard and cold, and most of the thralls focus on raising herd animals rather than trying to grow crops.
There are also a large number of burial mounds here – noticeably more than the Imperial armies have encountered elsewhere in northern Jotun lands. The thralls barely cooperate with the Imperial soldiers, but share a few stories of the long-ago battles between the Jarls of Skallahn and Tromsa. It seems these two territories have not always been so closely allied, although the stories strongly imply that these conflicts ended before the fall of Terunael. These ancient battles may have explained the presence of Viheltavathorn; the hall of the Jarl of Rikskog was a heavily fortified tower surrounded by a small town. The fortification was destroyed by the invading Imperials in their pursuit of Mathilda Fisher.
### Tromsdalen
West of Rikskog lies Tromsdalen. The region is rough and hilly, with perpetually snow-capped and cloud-wrapped mountains to the east. It is nestled between these high peaks, and the great Mount Majastind that lies in the centre of Tromsa. The mountains of Tromsdalen are part of the same range as Eyrarfell, and on their eastern edge stands the ''Oksenesfestsal'', a commanding Fortification that also serves as the seat of the Jarl of Tromsa.
