## Overview
There is only one port available to Imperial [[Characters|characters]] with the [[Fleet]] [[Resource|resource]]; Robec, in the [[Territory|territory]] of Veroigne. Robec is the site of the grand temple of Evra the Smith.
## Robec
At the mouth of the river Isoiile, the port-town of Robec is one of the largest settlements in the [[Iron Confederacy]], rivalling Meade in size. It has extensive docks and a fortified keep and a line of sea-defences designed to protect the town from naval assault. After the fort and the port, the largest structure in town is a grand temple to the Suranni god of Smiths, recently expanded with Imperial [[White granite|white granite]]. 
Imperial captains are (somewhat grudgingly) welcomed to this prosperous trading port. Most trade comes from the other Suranni towns along the coast of the [[Bay of Catazar]], and the Sea of Sighs. Imperial visitors often feel as if they are being watched - and most likely they are. The priests of Kavol are particularly alert to ensure that merchants from [[The Empire|the Empire]] do not engage in espionage while on Suranni soil.
### Trade with Robec
A starting [[Fleet|fleet]] resource that engages in trade with Robec during [[Downtime|downtime]] [[Will|will]] produce 4 ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]], 3 measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], 2 doses of [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]], and luxury goods [[Worth|worth]] 30 rings. A fleet that has been upgraded [[Will|will]] produce more valuable resources according to this chart of [[Foreign ports]].
