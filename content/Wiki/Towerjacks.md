### Overview
While the League used to field a second army, the [[Towerjacks]], that army ceased to exist in 346YE when its officers and soldiers dedicated themselves to the defence of their home territory ([[Holberg]]). While they were active, the Towerjacks were known for their expertise at [[Army qualities#Siege|siege]] warfare. With the liberation of Holberg, the officers of the Towerjacks  let it be known that they were prepared to return to [[holberg spoils of war#The Towerjacks|active duty]], provided they could be returned to full strength. A [[Raise_Towerjacks_army|motion before the Senate]] during the Summer Solstice 379YE gained permission to reinstate the Towerjacks. When their resupply and recruitment are complete, a new [[general]] was appointed in Winter 379YE.

The second League General leads the Towerjacks army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Winter Solstice each year.
