Most Marchers will wear some sort of headwear. Hoods, Coifs, caps and hats all add to the Marcher look.
Coifs are simple pieces of headwear. They can be made from linen, for every day wear, and from leather or padded linen or wool for combat. Coifs can be simple white linen, or embroidered and coloured for a fancier look.
A [[Coif]] can be worn under a hat or helmet for comfort.
