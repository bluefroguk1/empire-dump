## Overview
The Ambassador to Faraden is an [[Imperial title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The agreement to construct an official [[embassy]] was contingent on the liberation of [[Segura]], and the repair of the [[Segura#The Towers of Anduz|Towers of Anduz]]. Without these two achievements, the Empire had no ability to protect trade routes (and avenues for diplomatic envoys) through the northern Lasambrian Hills. Construction of a Faraden embassy in [[Segura#Anduz|Anduz]] was [[Construct_Faraden_embassy|commissioned]] by the Senate in Winter 378YE and completed shortly after the Summer Solstice 379YE.

Shortly before the Winter Solstice 382YE, Anduz was conquered by the Lasambrian Jotun, and the embassy was in their hands until Anduz was retaken shortly before Spring Equinox 384YE. During that time, the ambassador was unable to enjoy their [[Ambassador_to_Faraden#Faraden_Merchants|access to Faraden merchants]]. With all of Segura under Imperial control, things have returned to normal.

## Powers
### Imperial Ambassador to Faraden
The title has all the [[Ambassador#Powers|common powers]] of an ambassador: they receive a [[Ambassador#Briefing|briefing]], can receive a formal [[Ambassador#Delegation|delegation]], and may prepare a [[Ambassador#Treaty|treaty]].
### Faraden Merchants
The [[embassy]] in Segura means that the ambassador enjoys the benefits of [[Ambassador#Mercantile_Support|mercantile support]] from traders keen to curry their favour. As a [[ministry]], this allows them to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The ambassador spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

The production of the ministry is related to the operation the [[Segura#The Towers of Anduz|Towers of Anduz]] in [[Segura]].

Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Faraden]] in Winter 382YE the cost to benefit from the [[ministry]] increased by roughly a fifth. During the Autumn Equinox 384YE the Imperial Senate [[384YE_Autumn_Equinox_Senate_sessions#Ratify_Faraden_Treaty|ratified a treaty]] with the Faraden that saw the Faraden returned to a [[Tariffs#Mercantilist|mercantilist]] trading standards.
