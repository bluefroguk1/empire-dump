### Overview
First led by the legendary Tom Drake, this army is [[Army qualities#Resourceful|extremely well-supplied]] and has an excellent corps of quartermasters, allowing it to recover casualties much more swiftly than normal. Many of the soldiers in this army come from [[Mitwold]], and this has lead to a reputation for dogged determination and occasional internal conflict away from the battlefield. Its ranks have been swelled in recent years with soldiers displaced from the [[Mournwold]], which has helped exacerbate the situation. The army started the process of enlargement following the [[Enlargement_of_the_Drakes|Winter Solstice 382YE]]  and were [[Bills_or_bows#The_Drakes|relying on the support of their people]]. As of the Summer Solstice 384YE the Drakes are the first [[Imperial_army#Enlargement|large]] Marcher army.

The first Marcher General leads the Drakes army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer Solstice each year.
