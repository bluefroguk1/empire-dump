As strong as iron and as supple as a river reed. These great trees are the sinews of our world.
## Overview
Weirwood is a highly precious golden wood prized for its straight grain, flexibility, and strength. The durability and natural resistance to fire of weirwood make it particularly prized in the building of boats. It is one of the key materials used by the [[Imperial Senate]] to resupply armies or to [[commission]] new buildings and is a vital component of many [[opportunity|opportunities]].

Weirwood is bought and sold in Imperial wains. These weigh about 500kg, with a volume of half a cubic metre. Due to the vast weight, trading is done in [[Currency#Bourse_Certificates|Bourse Certificates]] provided by the civil service.

## Bourse Certificate
Weirwood is too bulky to easily transport to Anvil. To help facilitate trade across the Empire, the Imperial civil service provide [[Currency#Bourse_Certificates|Bourse certificates]] for every wain. Citizens can trade these certificates safe in the knowledge that they can be exchanged for a wain of weirwood when the need arises.

## Uses of Weirwood
### Commissions
Weirwood is primarily useful as a building material. The Senate can [[commission]] a range of buildings that fortify, enrich or uplift the Empire. Weirwood is usually required in the construction of:
 
* [[Imperial_navy#Senate_Commissions|Imperial Navy]] 
* [[Ministry]] - a ministry built with weirwood would allow the purchase of herbs.
* [[Sinecure]]  - a sinecure built with weirwood would generate rings or herbs.
* [[Great work]] - a great work built with weirwood would generate rings or herbs. 
* [[Runeforge]]
* [[College of Magic]]
* [[Shipyard]]
* [[Spy network]]
* [[Folly]]

### Upgrading Personal Resources
Weirwood can be used to upgrade:

*[[Fleet]] - each upgrade increases military strength of the unit is increased by 20
*[[Herb garden|Herb Garden]] - each upgrade gives 2 additional herbs, as chosen by the owner. 
*[[Farm]] - each upgrade gives 36 additional rings per season

To upgrade a resource requires Imperial wains of weirwood equal to the level the resource is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 forest costs 2 Imperial wains of weirwood, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.

## Weirwood Seats
There are few places in the Empire that produce weirwood. A weirwood seat can be a source of great wealth and prestige to whoever holds it. 
Elections for weirwood seats are held in winter each year.

### Recent History
The [[Great Forest at Reikos]] was seized by the Druj barbarians in 367YE. In [[379YE_Winter_Solstice_winds_of_war#The_Rains_of_Reikos| Winter 379YE]], the seat was liberated by Imperial armies. The Highborn attempted to have this allocated as a National seat, but the Senate appointed it an Imperial seat in [[Allocate_Great_Forest_II|Spring 380YE]]

In Winter 380 YE, [[The_Witches_of_Applefell#Attack_on_the_Weirwater_Vales| Dawnish witches]] attacked the shipment from the [[Weirwater Vales]] , and took five wains of that season's output.

In Spring 381YE, the Imperial Senate built a set of dedicated docks, trading with Magician-Prince of PÓ“rnau Principality in [[Jarm|Eastern Jarm]]. The resultant [[Prime_Factor_of_the_Pallas_Docks|Pallas Docks]] depends on the Empire retaining good relationship with Jarm. 

In Autumn 381YE, the Senate permitted the [[Great_Forest_Orcs| Great Forest Orcs]] to work the trees in the [[Thimble]] for the Empire in return for a [[Great_Forest_Orcs#Masters_of_Weirwood|bounty of four wains of weirwood]] each season. This means there is no costs to the Senate for the running of the forest and orcs could use the weirwood they gained to create herb gardens and similar in Therunin. 

Following the imposition of sanctions on the Principalities of Jarm during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the cost of purchasing weirwood through the [[Prime_Factor_of_the_Pallas_Docks|Pallas Docks]] increased by roughly a fifth.

In Spring 383 YE, [[The_honey_offering#Proposal:_Buying_the_Hunt|Varushkan merchants]] offered to pay 1000 thrones to turn the [[Hunt of Alderei the Fair]] National instead of Imperial.
