## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must possess the [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] skill. The ritual must include an invocation of the eternal Sorin by one of his recognised names.



### Effects
The target gains the ability to call [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]] with a [[Weapons & armour#Rods|rod]] four times a day when they hit a target, following the rules for a [[Heroic_skills|heroic skill]].

They also experience a [[roleplaying effect]]: ''you feel a strong urge to wield the power this ritual grants against anyone who disrespects, disobeys, or angers you, regardless of who they are.''




### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 11. Additional characters must be present throughout.
### Option

### Assurance
As with all rituals that [[Ritual_theory#Agreement|draw on the power]] of an [[eternal]], this ritual has an assurance which, if broken, causes it to lose all power. In this case, the ritual loses all power if ever [[the Throne|the Throne's]] ability to lead the Empire and represent her in all things is removed. It is not entirely clear exactly what breaking this assurance would entail. The scroll merely says that "''The Throne represents the apex of power and ambition for the people of the Empire; the Tomb Lord respects that.''"

## Description
During the Spring Equinox 385YE a scroll detailing this ritual was [[You_can%27t_count_on_me#Sorin.27s_Chastising_Touch|delivered]] to then [[Archmage of Winter]] Ematius of the Great Library of Ankarien by agents of the [[eternal]] [[Sorin]]. It was a gift in recognition of tribute delivered during a [[I_knew_you_were_trouble#Sorin|meeting]] at the Winter Solstice 384YE. At the time the eternal apparently expressed the hope that it would aid Imperial magicians to better understand his philosophy of gaining strength and greater understanding through experiencing suffering. As a gift, they were welcome to do with it as they wished - keep it, share it with their allies, add it to [[Formulaic_ritual#Imperial_Lore_and_the_Ritual_List|Imperial lore]], or even make it part of [[Urizen lore]]. In the end the Archmage chose to make it available to all Imperial magicians. The [[Dean of the Lyceum]], Simargl the Empty One, raised the [[declaration]] to make the ritual [[385YE_Spring_Equinox_Conclave_sessions#Imperial_Lore:_Sorin.27s_Chastising_Touch|part of Imperial lore]].

Invoking the power of [[Sorin]], the ritual creates a conduit whereby the magician channels the power of [[Winter magic|Winter]] to blast flesh and twist bone, without themselves being harmed by it. It uses a sceptre - a rod - that both symbolises the dominance of the wizard who wields it and protects them from exposure to the raw power of the Wasteland. Unlike a spell, the power of the ritual can be used even while armoured in leather or steel.

The original scroll contains some commentary from Sorin (or the underling charged with creating it). "''While its use in battle is clear, it can also be employed to remind underlings and rivals who rules. The damage it inflicts will not heal naturally; where a cut from a knife or the wound from a blow will fade swiftly the touch of chastisement remains until a physick or a healing magician treats it, a reminder that the underling has incurred the wrath of one who is more powerful than they are.''"

The ritual is clearly similar to [[Crumbling Flesh and Withering Limbs]]; indeed some magicians incorrectly used its name to describe that ritual. it allows a [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] to channel destructive, painful magic through their [[Weapons & armour#Rods|rod]]. The spell blasts flesh and twists bone, leaving a limb useless and crippled or immediately incapacitating a target with an agonizing burst of pain if it strikes the chest or belly. The rod needs to strike reasonably exposed flesh, but the magic penetrates heavy clothing and [[Weapons & armour#Light armour|light armour]] with ease. The effects of the withering cleave can be treated in the same way as a blow from a sword or axe.

## Common Elements
Magicians are still experimenting with the resonances of this ritual, but some of the techniques used to perform Crumbling Flesh and Wintering Limbs seem appropriate.The ritual almost always involves the target's implement in some fashion. Sometimes the rod is anointed with noxious preparations. Sometimes magician and rod alike are marked with the rune [[Kyrop]] which symbolises weakness, or with the [[astronomancy|astronomantic]] constellation of [[the Drowned Man]]. Invocations involving old age, disease and sickness are included. [[Blood magic|Blood magicians]] might use blood donated by [[draughir]], especially given Sorin's "affection" for that [[lineage]]

Even when not performed using [[Totem_magic#Goetia|goetia]], every casting must invoke the eternal Sorin by one of his recognisable names: his most common epithets include ''Hungry Wolf'', ''Tomb King'', the ''Empty One'', ''Devourer-of-Hope'', ''Hunger-Crow'', ''Father of Draughir'', and ''Master of Whelps''. It is likely unwise to add the evocation of additional [[eternal|eternals]] to a performance.
