The [[mana site]] flourishes with supernatural, wholesome life. It provides an additional bounty over the next season, in addition to the normal production of crystal mana.

At the start of the next season the target mana site provides seven random [[herbs]], four [[Materials#Natural_Materials|measures]] of random forest materials, and 36 rings.



### Additional Targets
