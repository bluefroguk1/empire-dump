Adaptation of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8lqZ-gjWQI&feature=kp "A Hero Comes Home"] by Alan Silvestri 

Lyrics and Melody adapted by Joshua Binks (link to come).


Prelude
Out of the mist of history,
He'll come again.
Sailing on ships across the sea
To our wounded Nation.

Signs of a saviour,
Like fire on the water.
Its what we prayed for,
One of our own.

Call
Just wait, though wide he may roam.

Response
Always a hero comes home.

Calls
He'll go where no-one can go.
He'll fight what no-one could fight.

''Continue in this style, making up things for the hero to do until the end;''

Call
He stands, brave and alone.

Response
But always a hero comes home.
