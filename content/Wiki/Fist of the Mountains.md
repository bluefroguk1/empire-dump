### Overview
This army is supported by a number of miners, engineers and ex-prospectors, and the captains are regularly advised by clever [[Wintermark magical traditions#Icewalkers|icewalkers]] and proud [[Wintermark culture and customs#Art and History|scops]]. Centuries of fighting in the mountains of [[Sermersuaq]], [[Skarsind]] and [[Hahnmark]] have left their soldiers with a reputation for caution and for an ability to fight viciously in tight spaces over vertiginous drops. By heeding the words of [[Army_qualities#Farsighted|farsighted]] advisors, the general can employ divination to allow them to find the perfect place to move their army. While such methods are unpredictable and difficult to make sense of, they mean the Fist of the Mountain is almost never where the enemy expects it to be - and often seems to be in the perfect place at the perfect time. 

The first Wintermark General leads the [[Fist of the Mountains]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer Solstice each year.
