__NOTOC__
## Overview
The Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration is an [[Imperial title]] that has the right to raise a single [[declaration]]. Although the bearer does not have to be a member of the [[Imperial Conclave]], they may raise any single declaration provided that they do so at the summit that the title was appointed.

## Power
### Rogue Declaration
The Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration is entitled to submit a single [[declaration]] of any kind to the agenda for the Saturday evening [[Conclave session]]. The Arbiter's declaration must be presented by themselves, or their proxy. To support this, the Civil Service provides a writ to the winner of the auction that allows them to submit a declaration.

Unlike other titles that have the power to raise a single declaration in the Conclave, such as the [[Imperial Censor]], [[Imperial Magus]], or the [[Bursar of the Conclave]], the Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration is not bound to any one type of declaration. Instead they may, much like the grandmasters, choose any type of declaration to raise. Unlike the [[grandmaster|grandmasters]] however they, or their legal proxy, must be the one to present the declaration during the session as it is a legal power of the title.

## Appointment
The Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration is determined by auction at the [[Auction_of_the_Seats#Additional_Titles|Auction of the Seats]] and is solely in crystal mana. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title. The crystal mana from the winning bid is then added to the [[font]] for the next summit.

The bearer retains the title ''for a single season only'' - they must use the power to raise a declaration at the summit where they gain the title, otherwise it is lost. As a title in the Conclave, the position cannot be 
[[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
