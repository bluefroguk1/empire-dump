### Overview
Fighting beneath an emerald green [[Banner|banner]] bearing the golden image of the rising sun, before the Gryphon's [[Pride]] was reformed the [[Eastern Sky]] was the youngest of the Dawnish armies. It has a long and proud tradition of defending the Dawnish heartlands from orcish aggression. They receive regular supplies from the people of [[Dawn]]; both civilians and soldiers alike possess a great deal of [[Pride|pride]] in the [[Eastern Sky]] and the families and descendants of those who have fought beneath the banner are fierce in their support. This means that the [[Eastern Sky]] can recover quickly even while on campaign. Many of the soldiers of the [[Eastern Sky]] have a particular hatred for the [[Druj]] [[Barbarians|barbarians]]; traditionally they are first to see the carnage the cruel orcs leave behind when they manage to gain access to an Imperial village. 
The third Dawnish [[General|general]] leads the [[Eastern Sky]], and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the [[Autumn]] equinox each year.

## Army Quality : Favoured
Originally renown for the support of the people of [[Dawn]] the army now benefits from the patronage of several Regents of [[Summer]]. Originally proposed just before the Autumn Equinox 384YE the enchantresses of [[Dawn]] opted to request the favour of the Summer Lion, the Queen of Ice and Darkness, the Lord of Summer Stars, the Knight of the [[Crossroads]], and the Regent of the [[Eternal]] Sea. At present the [[General|general]] can call on the favours of [[Eleonaris]] and [[Meraud]].
### Favour of [[Eleonaris]]
Triumphant Charge
* The ability of this army to capture [[Territory|territory]] is increased by two-fifths.
* [[Casualties]] inflicted by this army are increased by one fifth.
* [[Casualties]] suffered by this army are increased by half.
A [[General|general]] who unleashes their troops in a triumphant charge seeks great victory, but pays a great price. The army confronts the strongest enemy troops and the most defended positions, and attempts to rout them. Individual soldiers and companies engage in valiant attacks, employing risky tactics to defeat their opponents. The army [[Will|will]] gain much more ground, but does so at the [[Cost|cost]] of increased casualties.
### Favour of [[Meraud]]
Arcane Consolidation
* The army generates mana crystals based on the number of victory points generated.
* Does not change army strength, casualties inflicted or casualties suffered.
The army concentrates on making magical preparations, shoring up their reserves of mana crystals and seeking out nearby sources of [[Magic|magic]]. A portion of this bounty in the form of mana crystals is passed to the army [[General|general]] so that they can make the most appropriate use of it.
### Favour of [[Cathan Canae]]
*[[Cathan Canae]] is intrigued to be invited to aid the army, and while she could be encouraged to do so with a statue build in Dawnguard, she can also be convinced by the National [[Assembly]] of [[Dawn]] enacting a [[Mandate|mandate]].
Embrace the Storm
* Surrounded by storms and blizzards, the army can only move a single territory this season.
* The ability of this army to defend territory is increased by two fifths.
* Casualties suffered by this army are increased by a fifth
* Casualties inflicted by this army are increased by a fifth
* This is a defending order.
With [[Cathan Canae]]'s favour, the [[General]] of the Eastern Sky could order their army to embrace the storm. Hail storms and icy blizzards would greet the army wherever they went, reducing their movement to a single territory this season, but making any region they defend much more difficult to conquer, increasing their ability to defend territory by two fifths. In battle the freezing snow and chilling winds would bring death, increasing the casualties suffered by this army and the casualties inflicted by them by a fifth.
### Splendour of the White Bear
* [[Dawn]] can secure [[Cathan Canae]]'s favour by urging their armies to commit entirely when they take part in a defensive action
[[Cathan Canae]] endures, and expects others to do the same. A statue built in a [[Liberated|liberated]] Dawnguard would certainly win her support, but there is an alternative. According to one of her heralds, sent to speak with the [[Troubadours|troubadours]] of Dawn, she would be prepared to grant her favour to the Eastern Sky if the people of Dawn were to align themselves more strongly with her preferred methods of waging [[War|war]]. The troubadours have put their heads together and with the aid of the Civil Service proposed the following [[Mandate]] that would honour the Queen of Ice and Darkness, arguably better than any statue,
Mandate|mandate=A great life leaves a legend, and the soul cannot be armoured. When we stand against our enemies, We should do so as an unbreakable wall of ice and [[Adamant|adamant]]. We send (named priest) with 75 doses of [[Liao|liao]] to spread tales of glorious defence and urge all those who [[Fight|fight]] beneath our banners to become as immovable as [[The Mountain|the mountain]].|assembly=Dawn [[National Assembly]] 
If this [[Mandate|mandate]] is enacted, then going forward no General of Dawn [[Will|will]] be able to issue the Give Ground or Solid Defence orders; if they do they [[Will|will]] instead default to Heroic Stand. They would still be able to issue special defensive orders that arise from qualities or [[Opportunities|opportunities]] but in the normal course of a campaign they [[Will|will]] attempt to give as little ground as possible when they defend a territory. If this [[Mandate|mandate]] is enacted, Cathan Canae [[Will|will]] grant her boon to the Eastern Sky - removing the effects at a later date are likely to incur the [[Eternal|eternal]]'s displeasure.
### Favour of [[Barien]]
* Dame Autum de Castellan is currently undergoing a [[Challenge the Iron Duke]] and once complete [[Barien]] will happily support the Eastern Sky
Traverse the [[Crossroads]]
* Can move up to five territories this season. It must still stop moving when it enters a hostile territory.
* Casualties suffered by this army are increased by a fifth
* This is an attacking order.
With [[Barien]]'s favour, the General of the Eastern Sky could order their army to traverse the [[Crossroads|crossroads]]. The soldiers take advantage of [[Barien]]'s aid to move swiftly with the aid of [[Summer magic|summer magic]]. Roads seem shorter than people remember them and they always travel in the direction the army wishes to go. Sometimes they may even make use of summer [[Regio]] to gain strength for their journey, or to enjoy the hospitality of the inhabitants and wash the weariness of the road away. Such expedited travel is dangerous - the army may quickly move beyond its supply lines - but allows the army to travel with uncommon speed.
### Favour of [[Rhianos]]
* [[Rhianos]] can still be honoured with a statue, constructing a [[Fane|fane]] for him at the Tournament Grounds of Laroc, or rebuilding the Tower of the Manticore
Seek the Greatest Prize
* The ability of this army to capture territory is reduced by one fifth.
* The army generates wealth based on the number of victory points generated.
* This is an attacking order
The army looks for and takes opportunities for risky, dangerous adventures while fighting in a territory. They strike into enemy territory, taking chances that might lead to both opportunities to secure valuable items and create glorious stories for the troubadours. The General will receive a share of the bounty they secure in the form of wains of [[Mithril]], [[Weirwood]], and [[White granite]], rings of [[Ilium]], and more mundane loot such as money, ingots and measures, [[Herbs|herbs]], mana crystals or [[Vis|vis]], and even potentially ribboned items.
