### Overview
The guardians of the [[Granite Pillar]] are usually arrayed in heavy armour with shield and sword, supported by cataphracts and martially inclined magisters. They practice tactics designed to emphasise their discipline, and are always accompanied by military chaplains who dedicate themselves to supporting and blessing the soldiers, helping them to remain focused on [[The Battlefield]] and highlighting the virtues of [[Loyalty]], [[Courage]] and [[Pride]]. 
The first Highborn [[General]] leads the Granite Pillar army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer solstice each year.
