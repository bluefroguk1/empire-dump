Army Page
### Overview
This army is supported by a number of miners, engineers and ex-prospectors, and the captains are regularly advised by clever icewalkers and proud scops. Centuries of fighting in the mountains of [[Sermersuaq]], [[Skarsind]] and [[Hahnmark]] have left their soldiers with a reputation for caution and for an ability to [[Fight|fight]] viciously in tight spaces over vertiginous drops. By heeding the words of farsighted advisors, the [[General|general]] can employ divination to allow them to find the perfect place to move their army. While such methods are unpredictable and difficult to make sense of, they mean the Fist of [[The Mountain|the Mountain]] is almost never where the enemy expects it to be - and often seems to be in the perfect place at the perfect time. 
The first [[Wintermark]] [[General]] leads the [[Fist of the Mountains]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the [[Summer]] Solstice each year.
