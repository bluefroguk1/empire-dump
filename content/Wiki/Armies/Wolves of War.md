### Overview
The [[Wolves of War]] are an extremely versatile fighting force. Many of the soldiers in this army are [[Bravos]] from the roughest parts of [[Temeschwar]] and [[Tassato]], supported by talented engineers from [[Holberg]] and [[Sarvos|Sarvosian]] scouts. They are also adept at working with [[Army qualities#Mercenary|mercenary]] troops, taking advantage of the great wealth of the League to employ specialist units to help them on campaign.
In Autumn 378YE, the [[Dawn|Dawnish]] [[Archmage]] of Autumn, Maurice de Gauvain, took clever advantage of a rare conjunction to gather the [[Ilium]] needed to place a permanent [[Bound by Common Cause]] [[Enchantment]] on the [[Wolves of War]]. This enchantment greatly enhances the ability of the army to work with Imperial [[Military unit|military units]]. It coincidentally means that the General of the Wolves of [[War]] is subject to a [[Roleplaying effects|powerful magical influence]], but it remains to be seen how far-reaching this effect will be.
The first League General leads the [[Wolves of War]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Autumn Equinox each year.
