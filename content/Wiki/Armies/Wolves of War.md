### Overview
The [[Wolves of War]] are an extremely versatile fighting force. Many of the soldiers in this army are [[Bravos]] from the roughest parts of [[Temeschwar]] and [[Tassato]], supported by talented engineers from [[Holberg]] and Sarvosian scouts. They are also adept at working with mercenary troops, taking advantage of the great wealth of [[The League|the League]] to employ specialist units to help them on campaign.
In [[Autumn]] 378YE, the Dawnish [[Archmage of Autumn]], Maurice de Gauvain, took clever advantage of a rare conjunction to gather the [[Ilium]] needed to place a permanent [[Bound by Common Cause]] [[Enchantment]] on the Wolves of [[War]]. This [[Enchantment|enchantment]] greatly enhances the ability of the army to work with Imperial military units. It coincidentally means that the [[General]] of the [[Wolves of War]] is subject to a powerful magical influence, but it remains to be seen how far-reaching this effect [[Will|will]] be.
The first [[League]] [[General]] leads the Wolves of [[War]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Autumn Equinox each year.
