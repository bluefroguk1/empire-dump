### Overview
The fourth Marcher Army was raised by [[Raise Marcher Army|Senate motion]] proposed by Henry Ward, then Senator for Upwold, during the Winter Solstice of 377YE. Mustering completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 378YE. The army of The [[Tusks]] was briefly named after [[Mournwold#Green March|High Courage]], an ancient monument in Mournwold. This highly [[Army qualities#Disciplined|disciplined]] force saw its first major engagement when the Empire [[379YE Winter Solstice winds of war#The Mourning Wind|launched its liberation of the Mourn]] in late Autumn 379YE.
The fourth Marcher General leads the army of The [[Tusks]], and was initially appointed at the Summer Solstice each year. Starting in 384YE, however, the election was shifted to the Spring Equinox following [[Bills or bows#Resolution|the consideration of the Civil Service]].
