### Overview
The first [[Bloodcloaks]] army was destroyed by the [[Thule]] almost a century ago. Known for their crimson cloaks, the army was composed of many [[Wintermark military concerns#Grimnir|grimnir]] and [[Mystics]]; all save a few were slaughtered in the reign of [[Empress Brannan]] during a disastrous retreat from [[Otkodov]]. They left behind a legacy of heroism and healing that was carefully nurtured by the descendants of its physicks. The various threads of the army's tattered skein persisted - a healer here, a family there. In Spring 379YE, the Imperial Senate [[Raise Wintermark army|refused]] to allow Wintermark to raise the [[Bloodcloaks]] standard once again; they did not [[Raise Wintermark army II|relent]] until more a year later in Summer 380YE. The army finally mustered in [[Kallavesa]] shortly before the Spring Equinox 382YE. The army contains many grimnir, [[Surgical skills#Physick|physicks]], [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|apothecaries]], and magicians versed in [[Heal|healing magic]], allowing them to [[Army qualities#Physick|offer aid and respite]] to allied soldiers who fight alongside them.
The third Wintermark General leads the [[Bloodcloaks]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Spring Equinox each year.

### The Bloodcloak
Indeed, the [[General]] of the [[Bloodcloaks]] was the custodian of the "original" Bloodcloak - an [[Magic items#Artefacts|artifact]] version of the more common cloak. When the army fell to the [[Thule]] during the reign of [[Empress Brannan]], the Bloodcloak was lost - and with it the knowledge of how to make this useful [[Crafting skills#Physick|physicks']] tool. It was recovered in 381YE but Imperial heroes, and in Spring 384YE Lofyn Bloodcloak, then general of the army, worked with the magistrates to have the cloak recognised as ''regalia'' for the title - just as it had been in the earlier days of the Empire.
RegaliaThe original Bloodcloak is part of the regalia of the general. It is the legal property of the title. If the general loses their position, then the item must be given to the new general with all appropriate haste. The general is encouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe.
