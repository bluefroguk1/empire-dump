### Overview
The first [[Bloodcloaks]] army was destroyed by the [[Thule]] almost a century ago. Known for their crimson cloaks, the army was composed of many grimnir and Mystics; all save a few were slaughtered in the reign of [[Empress Brannan]] during a disastrous retreat from [[Otkodov]]. They left behind a [[Legacy]] of [[Heroism]] and Healing that was carefUlly nurtured by the descendants of its physicks. The various threads of the army's tattered skein persisted - a healer here, a [[Family]] there. In Spring 379YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] refused to allow [[Wintermark]] to raise the Bloodcloaks standard once again; they did not relent until more a year later in Summer 380YE. The army finally Mustered in [[Kallavesa]] shortly before the Spring Equinox 382YE. The army contains many grimnir, physicks, apothecaries, and Magicians versed in healing [[Magic]], allowing them to offer aid and respite to allied soldiers who [[Fight]] alongside them.
The third Wintermark [[General]] leads the Bloodcloaks army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Spring Equinox each year.

### The [[Bloodcloak]]
Indeed, the General of the Bloodcloaks was the custodian of the "original" Bloodcloak - an artifact version of the more common cloak. When the army fell to the Thule during the reign of Empress Brannan, the Bloodcloak was lost - and with it the knowledge of how to make this useful physicks' tool. It was recovered in 381YE but Imperial [[Heroes]], and in Spring 384YE Lofyn Bloodcloak, then general of the army, worked with the magistrates to have [[The Cloak]] recognised as ''regalia'' for the title - just as it had been in the Earlier days of [[The Empire]].
RegaliaThe original Bloodcloak is part of the regalia of the general. It is the legal property of the title. If the general loses their position, then the item must be given to the new General with all appropriate haste. The General is enCouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe.
