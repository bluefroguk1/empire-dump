### Overview
The [[Druj miasma]], or shroud of dread, was first encountered by Imperial troops crossing into [[Reikos]] during the [[Winter]] 378YE counter offensive against the orcs, but has since been encountered throughout [[The Mallum]], and in the attempt to liberate [[Zenith]]. Described as an almost physical pall of dread and despair, it infested the air, the water, and the soil. It was described by those exposed to it in fanciful terms; “clawing at the spirit”, “slowly grinding away every positive emotion”, and “threatening to undermine every virtuous thought”. 
At [[Night|night]], the effects of the miasma intensified. It seemed to take advantage of the long hours of darkness to play upon the natural fears, doubts, and uncertainties that come naturally to mortal minds. Some exposed to the miasma describe hallucinations, especially of deceased loved ones. There is no suggestion, however, that this effect is actually producing images of the dead – several soldiers reported catching sight of loved ones they knew were alive and safe at home, but seemingly murdered and weeping. The shroud of dread significantly impacts Imperial efforts to liberate territories claimed by the [[Druj]], slowing the advance of armies, and making it harder for them to claim [[Territory|territory]] from the eastern orcs..
## Study of the Miasma
The [[Druj miasma|Druj Miasma]] is not fully understood by Imperial scholars. It does not appear to have been created with conventional [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magic|magic]]. Rather, it bears more similarity to a massive [[Consecration|consecration]] associated with the malign spiritual presence of fear or dread. Yet the existence of a magical method to deal with the [[Aura|aura]] (coupled with [[Imperial Orcs]] inability to use [[Liao]] ceremonies) points to it being more than a purely spiritual effect.
Of particular interest is the fact that the miasma appears to have little or no effect on the [[Druj]] orcs themselves. Whether this is due to some property of the miasma, or because the [[Druj]] are "desensitized" to the fearsome effects of the shroud of dread, is not clear. It is notable that the [[Druj]]'s subject ''septs'' are not inured to its influence - even those who have lived their entire lives under its effects still feel the clawing dread.
There is significant speculation that the [[Aura|aura]] is useful to the [[Druj]] for more than simply slowing the advance of the Imperial forces. It also contributes to the atmosphere of terror and despair the orcs create among both their human prisoners and conquered septs - making it harder for their slaves to rebel against their authority. 
## Miasma Pillars
While the [[Aura|aura]] spreads across an entire Territory it is "anchored" by misshaped stone monoliths dubbed "miasma pillars". Each region of the territory [[Will|will]] contain at least one such pillar, and often holds several. The pillars appear to reinforce or supplement one another when they were in close proximity, and in this case removing the power of a single pillar proves ineffective if there are other pillars nearby. All nearby pillars needed to be deactivated simultaneously. If a single pillar is deactivated, there is little noticeable effect on the local miasma. Once all the pillars in a location are deactivated, however, the miasma quickly fades from the region. Unsurprisingly, the Druj often take pains to ensure that the pillars in a region are well defended. When they were first encountered, destroying miasma pillars presented a significant [[Challenge|challenge]] for both those engaged in breaking their power, and the soldiers protecting them.
While the miasma is unpleasant in the wider territory, the ''miasma pillars'' themselves are surrounded by the [[Aura|aura]] of dread in its most primal form. Even approaching a miasma pillar can prove extremely difficult without significant precautions such as ceremonial [[Anointing|anointing]]; the use of a ritual protection such as [[Crystal Clarity of the Rational Soul]]; or the use of [[Magic Items]] such as a [[Circlet of Falling Snow]].
In early 380YE, a combination of captains fighting to protect the [[Legacy|legacy]] of [[Highguard]], survivors motivated by the power of [[Courage]], and the rampant power of the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Llofir]], most of the [[Druj miasma]] pillars in [[Reikos]] were located and destroyed. After the conquest of [[Ossium]], the miasma pillars were quickly identified and destroyed by Imperial Scouts and agents of the [[Vigilance]] [[Assembly|assembly]]. They proved more durable in [[Zenith]], where they were commonly protected by tormented souls - former Imperial champions twisted to the service of the Druj by foul [[Magic|magic]] - eventually requiring the intervention of both the [[Imperial Senate]], the [[Granite Pillar]], and the Highborn [[Assembly]] before the last one could be removed and the territory freed. 
There is evidence that both [[Sarangrave]] and [[Forest of Ulnak]] have miasma pillars, and it is assumed they are also present in the [[Salt Flats of Sanath]]. It seems to take a little time for the Druj to spread their miasma over a territory - and there are no signs of them starting to do so before conquering the entire area. The one place they have controlled for extended periods of time without any sign of miasma is [[The Barrens]], but it's not clear why. Some scholars theorise that the territory is too large, but that is purely speculation. As with so much else about the miasma, and the Druj themselves, it remains a mystery.
In each of the territories where the miasma has been cleared, a handful of lesser pillars still exist. Their influence is extremely limited - no more than a mile at most around an active pillar.
## Destroying Pillars
Initially, the only way to destroy a miasma pillar was to use the [[Consecration]] ceremony, and a significant amount of [[Liao]] (and priests capable of wielding it). In [[Summer]] 379YE, the [[Chimes of Annulment]] ritual was developed and codified at the Halls of Knowledge in [[Zenith]], specifically to aid in destroying Miasma Pillars. Some have speculated that the Druj invasion of the territory, and their subsequent foray into [[Morrow]] that saw the Halls destroyed, were a reaction to the creation of the ritual. This seems unlikely - the Druj are petty but to launch an entire military campaign to "punish" the [[Urizen]] for creating a single ritual seems to be an extreme response even for them. There is also the question of how they would even know it existed. Either way, the ritual was added to the body of [[Imperial lore]] by [[Declaration|declaration]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]] in 379YE.
A second ritual, [[Dreadful Ending]], was added to [[Imperial lore]] in [[Spring]] 385YE. This [[Winter ritual]] is much less subtle than [[Chimes of Annulment]], using "brute force" to [[Shatter|shatter]] and tear at whatever force it is that empowers the pillars. It is harder to use, but particularly effective at dealing with situations where there are multiple pillars in close proximity.
The eternals [[Zakalwe]] and [[Janon]] are known to despise the miasma, and the pillars that anchor it. [[Zakalwe]] offered [[Assistance|assistance]] during a major conjunction of the [[Sentinel Gate]] during the liberation of [[Zenith]], for example. [[Janon]] is known to have created some boons specifically to [[Empower|empower]] [[Rituals|rituals]] intended to destroy the pillars even though they are not part of the lore of [[Night magic]].
## The Miasma in Play
* The miasma weakens anyone exposed to it who does not have the ability to overcome it
The primary effect of the miasma is that it weakens anyone exposed to it who does not have the ability to overcome it. The easiest method to overcome the miasma is to receive an [[Anointing]], but particularly heroic individuals, or those in possession of certain enchantments or [[Magic Items]] may also be able to counteract the effect. In particular, those of the [[Changeling]] [[Lineage]] are able to [[Fight|fight]] the effects of the miasma, but at the expense of becoming ''extremely'' angry - which can cause problems all its own.
In addition to the [[Rituals|rituals]] mentioned already, its also possible to unmake a miasma pillar with a powerful [[Consecration|consecration]]: a ceremony strength of 15 is commonly needed, requiring the cooperation of several [[Characters|characters]] and large amounts of [[Liao]].
Even when the miasma is removed from a territory. it may still be encountered during quests, skirmishes, or player [[Events|events]] taking place in the former Druj dominion.
The poisonous quality
The forests of Utterlund and Misericorde gained the ''poisonous'' quality shortly before the Summer solstice 380YE as a result of Druj activity. Each campaign army that moved through, or fought in, one of these regions would have suffered 250 [[Casualties|casualties]] during that season of campaigning. The effect was removed in 382YE, but the Druj attempted to establish a similar effect during their occupation of [[Zenith]]. Imperial [[Heroes|heroes]] stopped them, but it is possible that it may be encountered in [[The Mallum|the Mallum]] or created in other parts of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
