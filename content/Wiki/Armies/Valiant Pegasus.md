### Overview
The [[Valiant Pegasus]] is a relatively new army; recruitment was only completed in 378YE. Initially, the force incorporates some of the finest Highborn siege architects, and was well prepared both to take advantage of Imperial [[Fortifications]] and bring down barbarian strongholds. Following the [[Iron and wine#Opportunity: The Quality of Mercy|opportunity]] offered by the celebration of [[Empress Lisabetta]], the [[Valiant Pegasus]] refocused its efforts to the [[Army qualities#Physick|preservation of life]] on the battlefield, supported by many apothecaries. As a new army, it has yet to establish a particular identity or reputation for itself.
The third Highborn General leads the [[Valiant Pegasus]], and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Spring equinox each year.

## Army Quality : Physick
When the army was created, it contained many fine Highborn siege architects, but the modern [[Valiant Pegasus]] eschews attacking [[Fortification|fortifications]] in favour of [[Army qualities#Physick|preservation of Imperial lives]].
