Army Page
### Overview
The [[Valiant Pegasus]] is a relatively new army; recruitment was only completed in 378YE. Initially, the force incorporates some of the finest Highborn siege Architects, and was well prepared both to take advantage of Imperial Fortifications and bring down Barbarian strongholds. Following the Opportunity offered by the celebration of [[Empress Lisabetta]], the Valiant Pegasus refocused its efforts to the preservation of life on [[The Battlefield]], supported by many apothecaries. As a new army, it has yet to establish a particular identity or reputation for itself.
The third Highborn [[General]] leads the Valiant Pegasus, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Spring equinox each year.

When the army was created, it contained many fine Highborn siege architects, but the modern Valiant Pegasus eschews attacking fortifications in favour of preservation of Imperial lives.
