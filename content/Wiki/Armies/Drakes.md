### Overview
First led by the legendary Tom Drake, this army is [[Army qualities#Resourceful|extremely well-supplied]] and has an excellent corps of quartermasters, allowing it to recover casualties much more swiftly than normal. Many of the soldiers in this army come from [[Mitwold]], and this has lead to a reputation for dogged determination and occasional internal conflict away from the battlefield. Its ranks have been swelled in recent years with soldiers displaced from the [[Mournwold]], which has helped exacerbate the situation. The army started the process of enlargement following the [[Enlargement of the Drakes|Winter Solstice 382YE]]  and were [[Bills or bows#The Drakes|relying on the support of their people]]. As of the Summer Solstice 384YE the [[Drakes]] are the first [[Imperial army#Enlargement|large]] Marcher army.
The first Marcher General leads the [[Drakes]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer Solstice each year.
