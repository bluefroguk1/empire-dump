### Overview
First led by the legendary Tom Drake, this army is extremely well-supplied and has an excellent corps of quartermasters, allowing it to recover [[Casualties|casualties]] much more swiftly than normal. Many of the soldiers in this army come from [[Mitwold]], and this has lead to a reputation for dogged determination and occasional internal conflict away from [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. Its ranks have been swelled in recent years with soldiers displaced from the [[Mournwold]], which has helped exacerbate the situation. The army started the process of enlargement following the [[Winter]] Solstice 382YE  and were relying on the support of their people. As of the [[Summer]] Solstice 384YE the [[Drakes]] are the first large Marcher army.
The first Marcher [[General]] leads the [[Drakes]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer Solstice each year.
