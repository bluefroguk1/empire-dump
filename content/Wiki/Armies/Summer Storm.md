Army Page
### Overview
This army was formed from orcs who had originally been slaves in [[Dawn]], [[The Marches]] and the southern and eastern cities of [[The League]]. Their uprising had taken part in the rich heartlands of [[The Empire|the Empire]], and they did not need to deal with the harsh northern climate that troubled orcs in [[Varushka]], [[Wintermark]] and [[Highguard]]. They also tended to be better equipped; they were more able to loot weapons and armour, and were in a good position to deal with the '[[War|war]] profiteers' from [[The Brass Coast]] and [[League]] cities. Perhaps just as importantly, the southern slaves were often surprisingly well versed in tactics, subterfuge and trade than their northern cousins - many more of them had spent their time as bodyguards, bouncers or gladiators than in the north.
Today the [[Summer Storm]] [[Pride|pride]] themselves on their military acumen. They are the hammer of the [[Imperial Orcs]], well armed and armoured, 
versed in strategy and tactics, and supported by cunning bonesetters and thief-takers. They tend to be richer in terms of wealth and crafted items, and the first smiths and artisans were part of the [[Summer Storm]].
Shortly before the [[Summer]] solstice 380YE, while fighting the [[Jotun]] in the [[Mournwold]], the soldiers of the Summer Storm experienced a profound moment of connection with a [[Jotun]] ancestor, Sj√∂fn of the Bittenblade. Apparently an ancient Jotun who appears unconcerned by the nature of the [[Imperial Orcs]]; her voice encourages them to [[Fight|fight]] heroically, gloriously, and revel in the clash of steel on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. (OOC Note: Any Imperial Orc who might have been present during that campaign can hear this ancestor if they wish; she encourages them to take actions that are in line with the five things of the Jotun.)
The Summer Sun is a large army, known for its ruthless commitment to the arts of [[War|war]], and its indomitable fighting spirit.
The second Imperial orc [[General]] leads the Summer Storm, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer Solstice.
