### Overview
This army was formed from orcs who had originally been slaves in [[Dawn]], [[The Marches]] and the southern and eastern cities of [[The League]]. Their uprising had taken part in the rich heartlands of the Empire, and they did not need to deal with the harsh northern climate that troubled orcs in Varushka, Wintermark and Highguard. They also tended to be better equipped; they were more able to loot weapons and armour, and were in a good position to deal with the '[[War|war]] profiteers' from [[The Brass Coast]] and League cities. Perhaps just as importantly, the southern slaves were often surprisingly well versed in tactics, subterfuge and trade than their northern cousins - many more of them had spent their time as bodyguards, bouncers or gladiators than in the north.
Today the [[Summer Storm]] pride themselves on their military acumen. They are the hammer of the Imperial Orcs, well armed and armoured, 
versed in strategy and tactics, and supported by cunning [[Imperial Orcs economic interests#Bonesetters|bonesetters]] and [[Imperial Orcs economic interests#thief-takers|thief-takers]]. They tend to be richer in terms of wealth and crafted items, and the first smiths and [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] were part of the [[Summer Storm]].
Shortly before the Summer solstice 380YE, while fighting the [[Jotun]] in the [[Mournwold]], the soldiers of the [[Summer Storm]] experienced a [[380YE Summer Solstice winds of war#Game Information|profound moment of connection]] with a [[Jotun]] ancestor, Sj√∂fn of the Bittenblade. Apparently an ancient [[Jotun]] who appears unconcerned by the nature of the Imperial Orcs; her voice encourages them to fight heroically, gloriously, and revel in the clash of steel on the battlefield. (OOC Note: Any Imperial Orc who might have been present during that campaign can hear this ancestor if they wish; she encourages them to take actions that are in line with the [[Jotun#5 things to know about the Jotun|five things]] of the [[Jotun]].)
The Summer Sun is a [[Imperial armies#Large|large]] army, known for its [[Army qualities#Relentless|ruthless]] commitment to the arts of [[War|war]], and its indomitable fighting spirit.
The second Imperial orc General leads the [[Summer Storm]], and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer Solstice.
