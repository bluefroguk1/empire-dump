### Overview
When people think of [[Dawn]] their first thought is usually the nation's knights, arrayed in mail, swords gleaming, ready for battle. As befits a nation with such an emphasis on heavy armour, the soldiers who [[Fight|fight]] under the [[Golden Sun]] [[Banner|banner]] are especially resilient, known for their implacable, barely resistible, advances through enemy [[Territory|territory]]. There is some [[Friendly rivalry|friendly rivalry]] between soldiers of the [[Golden Sun]] and the [[Hounds of Glory]], and when their soldiers meet they often engage in contests of strength and martial might. 
Towards the end of 382YE, inspired by the recent victories and urged to seek [[Glory|glory]] through service to [[Dawn]], thousands more yeofolk requested to join the Dawnish armies. The Golden Sun, one of the oldest armies of Dawn, was their first choice, probably because its [[General|general]] is sometimes referred to as the First [[General]] of Dawn. The [[Imperial Senate]] approved of this course of action, and the Golden Sun is now on track to become the first large army in Dawnish [[History|history]]. . 
The first Dawnish general leads the Golden Sun army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the [[Summer]] solstice each year.
