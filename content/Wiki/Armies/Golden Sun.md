### Overview

As befits a nation with such an emphasis on heavy armour, the soldiers who [[Fight]] under the [[Golden Sun]] banner are especially resilient, known for their implacable, barely resistible, advances through enemy territory. There is some [[Friendly rivalry]] between soldiers of the Golden Sun and the [[Hounds of Glory]], and when their soldiers meet they often engage in contests of strength and martial might. 
ToWards the end of 382YE, inSpired by the recent victories and urged to seek [[Glory]] through service to Dawn, thousands more yeofolk requested to join the Dawnish armies. The Golden Sun, one of the oldest armies of Dawn, was their first choice, probably because its [[General]] is sometimes referred to as the First General of Dawn. The [[Imperial Senate]] approved of this course of action, and the Golden Sun is now on track to become the first large army in Dawnish history. . 
The first Dawnish general leads the Golden Sun army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer solstice each year.
