### Overview
When people think of Dawn their first thought is usually the nation's knights, arrayed in mail, swords gleaming, ready for battle. As befits a nation with such an emphasis on heavy armour, the soldiers who fight under the [[Golden Sun]] banner are especially [[Army qualities#Resilient|resilient]], known for their implacable, barely resistible, advances through enemy territory. There is some friendly rivalry between soldiers of the [[Golden Sun]] and the [[Hounds of Glory]], and when their soldiers meet they often engage in contests of strength and martial might. 
Towards the end of 382YE, inspired by the recent victories and urged to seek glory through service to Dawn, thousands more yeofolk requested to join the Dawnish armies. The [[Golden Sun]], one of the oldest armies of Dawn, [[Swords and sorcery#Golden Sun|was their first choice]], probably because its general is sometimes referred to as the First General of Dawn. The Imperial Senate [[Enlargement of the Golden Sun|approved]] of this course of action, and the [[Golden Sun]] is now on track to become the first [[Imperial army#Enlargement|large]] army in Dawnish history. . 
The first Dawnish general leads the Golden Sun army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer solstice each year.
