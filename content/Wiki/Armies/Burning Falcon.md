## Overview
Lost long ago, the [[Burning Falcon]] were famous (and in some cases infamous) for the passionate zeal with which they fought. In 248YE the [[Burning]] Falcon army was destroyed by the [[Jotun]] while Fighting to defend [[The Academy]] at Ishal in [[Kallavesa]]. Since their loss of it the Coast has not enjoyed such a large and organised force of [[Kohan]] on [[The Battlefield]] - although recent developments have suggested that the army may at last be on the verge of rising from the ashes. Not that the Burning Falcon is without controversy of its own - [[Emperor Nicovar]] took control of the army and wielded it as a [[Brand]] to burn the libraries of [[The Empire]]. Some historians suggest that it was lingering resentment for their role in the burning of the libraries that lead to the Falcon being left to [[Fight]] alone against a force of orcs three times its size.
The newly raised Burning Falcon finished Mustering in [[Madruga]] just before the Winter Solstice 384YE.
### History
The Burning Falcon was destroyed in 248YE defending the academy at Ishal in Kallavesa.
### Recent History
Since Summer 382YE, there has been a movement in parts of [[The Brass Coast]] to recreate the Burning Falcon. This led to an unsuccessful [[Senate motion]] in Spring 383YE, followed by a successful motion a year later in Spring 384YE.
### Traditions

### The Flame Rampant
The [[General]] of the Burning Falcon was the custodian of the Flame Rampant - a [[Sunfire Pennant]]. When the army fell to the Jotun during the reign of [[Emperor Guntherm]], the Flame Rampant was lost to the swamps of Kallavesa. It was recovered and brought to [[Anvil]] during the Summer Solstice 383YE in order to be reforged. When the Senate passed the motion to raise the Burning Falcon once again in Spring 384YE the standard was included as regalia for the general.
RegaliaThe Flame Rampant is part of the regalia of the general. It is the legal property of the title. If the general loses their position, then the item must be given to the new general with all appropriate haste. The General is enCouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe.
