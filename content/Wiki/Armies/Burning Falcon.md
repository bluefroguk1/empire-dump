## Overview
Lost long ago, the [[Burning Falcon]] were famous (and in some cases infamous) for the passionate zeal with which they fought. In 248YE the [[Burning]] Falcon army was destroyed by the [[Jotun]] while fighting to defend [[The Academy|the academy]] at Ishal in [[Kallavesa]]. Since their loss of it the Coast has not enjoyed such a large and organised force of [[Kohan]] on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] - although recent developments have suggested that the army may at last be on the verge of rising from the ashes. Not that the [[Burning Falcon]] is without controversy of its own - [[Emperor Nicovar]] took control of the army and wielded it as a [[Brand|brand]] to burn the libraries of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Some historians suggest that it was lingering resentment for their role in the [[Burning|burning]] of the libraries that lead to the Falcon being left to [[Fight|fight]] alone against a force of orcs three times its size.
The newly raised [[Burning Falcon]] finished mustering in [[Madruga]] just before the [[Winter]] Solstice 384YE.
### [[History]]
The [[Burning]] Falcon was destroyed in 248YE defending [[The Academy|the academy]] at Ishal in [[Kallavesa]].
### Recent History
Since [[Summer]] 382YE, there has been a movement in parts of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] to recreate the [[Burning Falcon]]. This led to an unsuccessful [[Senate motion]] in [[Spring]] 383YE, followed by a successful motion a year later in Spring 384YE.
### Traditions

### The Flame Rampant
The [[General]] of the [[Burning]] Falcon was the custodian of the Flame Rampant - a [[Sunfire Pennant]]. When the army fell to the [[Jotun]] during the reign of [[Emperor Guntherm]], the Flame Rampant was lost to the swamps of [[Kallavesa]]. It was recovered and brought to [[Anvil]] during the Summer Solstice 383YE in order to be reforged. When [[The Senate|the Senate]] passed the motion to raise the [[Burning Falcon]] once again in Spring 384YE the standard was included as regalia for the [[General|general]].
RegaliaThe Flame Rampant is part of the regalia of the [[General|general]]. It is the legal property of the title. If the [[General|general]] loses their position, then the item must be given to the new [[General|general]] with all appropriate haste. The general is encouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe.

## Army Quality : Glorious
The original [[Burning]] Falcon was populated by soldiers who embraced the [[Freeborn]] philosophy of passionate battle, giving them the Glorious quality. When the army finished mustering in [[Madruga]] just before the Winter Solstice 384YE it was once again full of passionate [[Kohan]] willing to embrace an utter commitment to the act of [[War|war]].
