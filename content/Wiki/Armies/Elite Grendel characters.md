## Overview
The armies of the [[Grendel]] feature a number of elite [[Characters|characters]] vital to the well-being of the army, they provide support and leadership and fill out roles not performed by the core troops.
## Sky Mages
Sky mages are the primary healers in the [[Grendel]] forces and most Moridun forces [[Will|will]] be fielded with at least one and usually more. They are capable battle-trained magicians, with a strong emphasis on healing magics. They use their [[Magic|magic]] to protect the soldiers they support, rather than to attack; they expect to be protected by the soldiers they are accompanying. 
A sky [[Mage|mage]] is much more than just a healer however - they represent a crucial part of the command structure that provides a unit with leadership and their commander with authority. This privileged role has arisen because the [[Grendel]] are profoundly mercenary - they weigh the value of everything - and they know that the powers of their healers are limited. As a result they cast spells sparingly - trying to use their [[Magic|magic]] when it [[Will|will]] have the most effect - and crucially on members of the unit who are most useful. Anyone who is not pulling their weight...
Soldiers who break the line early know that the sky mages [[Will|will]] not waste their mana to [[Heal|heal]] them if they are cut down. Young, brash [[Grendel]] learn to adapt to the discipline demanded by their unit quickly - those who do not find their lives ebbing away from them on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] as their sky mages pass them by in search of more useful members of the unit to [[Heal|heal]]. [[Grendel]] soldiers serving in the moridun soon learn that any break in discipline, any loss of nerve, any cowardice, can be fatal. The sky mages are trained to watch the soldiers they [[Fight|fight]] behind at all times, assessing them, judging them, weighing where their [[Magic|magic]] can be most usefully expended.
These reports are fed back to their commanders, they affect a soldiers pay - and for some their hopes of promotion through the ranks. As a result, most sky mages are feared by the troops they serve alongside. To cross your sky [[Mage|mage]] likely means death [[Will|will]] soon find you. Only by obeying orders without question, only by committing to every [[Fight|fight]] with every ounce of their being can they be certain that their sky [[Mage|mage]] [[Will|will]] judge them [[Worth|worth]] healing if they fall.
