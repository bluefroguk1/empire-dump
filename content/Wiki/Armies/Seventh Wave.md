### Overview
While the core of the [[Seventh Wave]] is heavily armoured guardians, it is supported by a number of [[Unconquered|unconquered]], scouts, skirmishers and magicians. The army makes great use of mixed-arms tactics, supporting shield-and-sword with bow, or bow with polearm and pike. They are adept scouts, capable of quickly sizing up their enemies and giving clear reports on all elements of [[The Military|the military]] campaigns in which they are involved. Shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice 383YE, the [[Seventh Wave]] became a large army.
The second Highborn [[General]] leads the Seventh Wave, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the [[Autumn]] equinox each year
