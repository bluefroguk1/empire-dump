### Overview
The [[History|history]] of the army of the [[Golden Axe]] is a history of sustained assault, horrible [[Battles|battles]] and massive losses. The Varushkan soldiers are philosophical - someone has to do the hard work - but also adaptable. They consider themselves good at surviving against odds that would devastate other armies; they are known for ruthlessly crushing all opposition during their slow grinding advance through enemy [[Territory|territory]]. Pessimism has become the norm for the officers of this army, although their dire pronouncements of failure are often rendered incorrect by their own [[Heroism|heroism]] and fortitude. In recent years they have been driven to embrace [[Legacy|legacy]] of the Vard; to conquer what can be conquered, to bar their door against what cannot be defeated, and to endure what must be endured without flinching.
Furthermore, as of the [[Summer]] Solstice 383YE, the [[Golden Axe]] is a large army, reinforced by the wealth of [[Varushka]] with the aid of the mining families of Moresvah in [[Karsk]]..
The second Varushkan [[General]] leads the Army of the Golden Axe, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the [[Winter]] solstice each year.
