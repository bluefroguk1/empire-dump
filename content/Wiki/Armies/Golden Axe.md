### Overview
The history of the army of the [[Golden Axe]] is a history of sustained assault, horrible battles and massive losses. The Varushkan soldiers are philosophical - someone has to do the hard work - but also adaptable. They consider themselves good at surviving against odds that would devastate other armies; they are known for Ruthlessly crushing all opposition during their slow Grinding advance through enemy territory. Pessimism has become the norm for the officers of this army, although their dire pronouncements of failure are often rendered incorrect by their own [[Heroism]] and fortitude. In recent years they have been driven to embrace [[Legacy]] of the Vard; to conquer what can be conquered, to bar their door against what cannot be defeated, and to endure what must be endured without flinching.
Furthermore, as of the Summer Solstice 383YE, the Golden Axe is a large army, reinforced by the wealth of [[Varushka]] with the aid of the mining families of Moresvah in [[Karsk]]..
The second Varushkan [[General]] leads the Army of the Golden Axe, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Winter solstice each year.
