Army Page
### Overview
This adaptable army attracts many beaters who support a solid core of [[Upwold]] soldiers and a small cadre of dedicated battlefield magicians. They are skilled skirmish fighters, able to quickly learn the lay of the land and relentless in their pursuit of their enemies. Some of the best military archers in [[The Empire|the Empire]] are part of the [[Bounders]] adept at bringing down their opponents with a combination of clever placement and withering storms of arrows. They are also adept scouts and trackers - unsurprising perhaps given the number of beaters who serve or have served under their [[Banner|banner]]. Since the [[Spring]] of 383YE, they have focused their efforts on guarding the borders of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
The third Marcher [[General]] leads the [[Bounders]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the [[Autumn]] equinox each year.
