Army Page
### Overview
The army of the [[Quiet Step]] is loosely organised, allowing individual components a certain amount of leeway to operate as they see fit but benefiting from a central logistical core. They were once known for their experienced scouts capable of quickly gathering information about the enemy armies they encounter. They are equally adept at facing Barbarian orcs, Vallornspawn and Varushkan Monsters. Since the Winter Solstice 381Y, however, they refocused their purpose toWard more aggressive tactics, employing cunning strategies to confound and slaughter their foes. This shift in emphasis was effected with the [[Assistance]] of the [[Eternal]] known as the Spider King - heralds and creatures loyal to [[Arhallogen]] sometimes accompany or support the army.
The second [[Navarr]] [[General]] leads the Quiet Step army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Autumn equinox each year.
