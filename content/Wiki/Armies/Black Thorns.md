Army Page
### Overview
This large army is especially fast moving, able to cross great distances very quickly. They are especially adept at using the trods to move large numbers quickly, and have excellent logistical support as well as several covens of vates and apothecaries who help restore troops after forced marches. They have a knack, historically, of turning up just in time to help tip the outcome of a campaign.
The first [[Navarr]] [[General]] leads the [[Black Thorns]] army, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Summer solstice each year.
