## Definition
A mine represents a worked holding. It could be a small but profitable shaft mine, a series of underground tunnels, or it could be something as small as a panning operation.

## Production
Upon taking a mine, you must choose one of [[Materials#Green_Iron|green iron]], [[Materials#Tempest_Jade|tempest jade]], [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]] or [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. A mine produces 12 ingots of the chosen material.

## Downtime Options
It is possible to obtain additional materials from a mine during any given season. You may spend 6 crowns to have the mine produce an additional 5 ingots of the same material as it would naturally produce.

## Upgrades
A mine can be upgraded using [[mithril]] obtained from the Bourse. Each time a mine is upgraded, the owner receives an additional 2 ingots from then on.

To upgrade a mine requires Imperial wains of mithril equal to the level the mine is being upgraded to. So the first upgrade of a starting level 1 mine costs 2 Imperial wains of mithril, from 2 to 3 costs 3 Imperial wains, etc.

## Diversification
A mine can be diversified to sacrifice production of one material for another. To diversify a mine costs one throne. Each time a mine diversifies, the owner chooses a different resource from the list for mines; the mine produces 2 ingots of the new material at the expense of 2 less of the original material. 

## Rituals
The table below shows a list of the rituals in both Imperial lore and Urizen lore which can affect the production of a business.
