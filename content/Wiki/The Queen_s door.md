"I've found this - I think this could be what Eleonaris' heralds are referring to." He placed the paper he'd unearthed on her desk and then quickly turned it round so that she could read it. Rather than loom over the desk, he took the liberty of sitting in the spare chair. Anyetta's office was small but fortunately there was just enough room for a guest to sit down. 

Years of practice meant Anyetta was able to quickly scan the document to get the gist of it. He watched her eyebrows rise at least twice, but she said nothing. Not until she got to the end.

"Arvandor the White... wasn't she executed for sorcery?"

"I think so..." he said somewhat sheepishly... "but as far as I can tell there was nothing wrong with the ''technical'' merits of her plan..."

## Overview

[[Eleonaris]], the Commander of the Golden Armies, the Queen of the Fields of Glory is angry with the Empire. This is not unusual, all the [[eternal|eternals]] of Summer are prone to fits of rage that pass like a summer storm, but Eleonaris is perhaps the most famous for her fiery demeanour. Yakti the Cowled, the wise Varushkan [[archmage]] who served in the time of [[Emperor Hugh]] famously called her "''an intemperate child, trapped in the body of a mighty warrior"'', though obviously not to her face.

The cause of her rage this time is that the Empire has called on her aid too many times - apparently without publicly thanking her for this support. Thus, the Lion of Summer has [[Sun_green#Eleonaris|thrown a strop]] and [[Power,_corruption,_and_lies#Eleonaris|refused to let the Empire play with her toys]] until they make it up to her. Quite how that might be accomplished has been extraordinarily vague to date, but after some coaxing the civil service has been able to identify four ways in which she could be placated or pleased.

## Will You Tell Me Why?
* Eleonaris has demanded that the Empire stop using the [[Knights of Glory]] ritual on pain of serious repercussions
Doubtless, there are some perceived slights or comments that have offended the Lion of Summer, but the true cause of her anger seems to be the many castings of [[Knights of Glory]] which have taken place in recent years. This powerful ritual draws on pacts with Eleonaris to call a host of her heralds to issue forth from the Summer realm to join an established army and fight alongside them on campaign for a season.

Because the ritual draws on the power of the Lion of Summer, it could only be created with their [[Ritual_theory#Agreement|agreement]]. There are many [[Ritual_theory#Rituals_that_deal_with_Eternals|such rituals in Imperial lore]], all of which require the agreement of a single eternal to function. Because these rituals draw on the power of the eternal, they come at some cost to the eternal in question. These costs are not always clear, but in the case of Knights of Glory, one cost at least is very obvious. Many of her knights that issued forth fell in the battles they fought in, never to return to serving their queen on the Fields of Glory. 

Sometimes an eternal wants Imperial magicians to cast a ritual that draws on their power, for reasons of their own. A ritual like [[Challenge the Iron Duke]] clearly requires considerable time and energy by the [[Barien|the Duke]], but they appear to relish setting challenges for people. But using a ritual that draws on their power costs that eternal something so in most cases, they will expect something in return. It is always a mistake to ''assume'' that the eternal will be gratified by casting a ritual that draws on their power - it is much safer to expect there to be a price of some kind. That might be as simple as gratitude for a favour given, or respect for a friendship honoured. With some Autumn rituals like [[Before the Throne of Estavus]], the price forms part of the agreement. One thing is clear, the more powerful the ritual, the greater the debt.

It is important to stress that Eleonaris ''cannot'' refuse to answer the summons when Knights of Glory is cast. Provided the Empire do not break the agreements made when creating the ritual, her host ''must'' issue forth in response. What the Lion of Summer can do - what she has done - is throw a temper tantrum, refusing to talk to the Summer Archmage and issuing vague threats to lend all possible assistance to the Empire's enemies should they cast the ritual again. 

As a result, the Empire has chosen to deny itself the use of this important ritual for fear of the Queen's vengeance. The Summer Archmage has worked tirelessly to resolve the dispute. Now thanks to their efforts, the Empire is in a position to mollify the eternal - if they are prepared to pay the price.

## The Safe Route
* Mollifying Eleonaris is likely to require a Senate commission
* One proposal is a folly, ceded to Eleonaris, requiring at least 30 wains of white granite and 60 crowns to build
* The civil service has proposed that Semmer's Rose in Semmerholm would be the ideal location for such a monument
In the beginning, the Lion of Summer might well have been placated by a suitably worded [[Imperial Synod|Synod]] [[judgement]] praising her prowess and majesty. The [[The Throne|Throne]] might have used [[The_Throne#Powers_of_State|their powers to address the Empire]] to issue a decree thanking her for her aid (historically, the Lion of Summer has been impressed by words of praise issuing forth from the individual they see as their temporal and moral equivalent in the mortal world). The [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] might have passed a [[Senate motion|motion]] thanking her - or the Conclave could even have used a simple [[declaration]] to ensure the Mistress of the Fields of Glory felt appreciated.

Sadly the window of opportunity for such measures has long passed. The Lion of Summer is seething and those storm clouds will not break until the Empire takes concrete steps to prove the respect with which they view the Sovereign in Scarlet and Gold. In short, the Empire would need to build an appropriate [[commission]] - and someone would have to pay for it.

The safest option would be to construct a suitable [[folly]] and [[Powers_of_the_Imperial_Senate#Concedence|cede]] it to the Lady of Pennants. It would need to be a significant construction, and be built in such a way that it reflects the glory of the proud eternal to whom it would be given. One possible site the Imperial prognosticators have identified is [[Semmerholm#Semmer.27s_Rose|Semmer's Rose]] in Semmerholm. Famed for its shrines to the exemplars and paragons of Dawnish history, the Empire could commission a monument to celebrate the glory and sacrifice of the many elfin knights that have sacrificed themselves in their cause.

The Lion of Summer is bound to be flattered by a monument to her majesty placed in such a prestigious location. The commission would take a season to construct and would require 30 wains of white granite and 60 crowns to build. If the commission (or something of comparable size and prestige in another location) was completed and ceded to Eleonaris then her temper would break and the entire conflict would be rapidly forgotten... at least until next time.

## The Adventurous Options
* Alternatively, a fane might be commissioned to placate Eleonaris
* This new commission would require 10 wains of mithril, 10 rings of ilium, and 20 crowns
* The civil service have identified two potential ''regio'' where a fane might be gainfully constructed
A much more... adventurous option would be to construct a [[fane]]. The Imperial Conclave directed the civil service to investigate the construction of an [[embassy]] to the Summer Realm, but nobody was certain what such a structure might entail. After lengthy research, the nearest thing anyone can identify that might work similarly is based on an ancient design that was created by a Dawnish [[enchanter]] called Arvandor the White. Arvandor claimed to be a direct descendent of [[Dawn_monarchy|the Swan]] and was said to be overcome by ardour for [[Cathan Canae|the Mistress of Blizzards]]. She sought to create the ''fane'' as a way to win the Lady of the Frost's favour but she was executed for [[sorcery]] before she could gather all the materials needed.

To construct a fane that might impress the Lion of Summer, the Empire would need to identify a suitable summer [[regio]] that would have to be ceded to Eleonaris along with the fane itself. The commission would take a single season and require 10 wains of mithril, 10 rings of [[ilium]] and 20 crowns, but once complete it would create a powerful warding that enabled heralds of the Lion of Summer to come and go as they please throughout the region it was in. The fane would grant Eleonaris the ability to build any structure she chose on that site, much like [[Llofir]] did when it established its garden in [[Reikos]].

Constructing a fane would require the Empire to trust the motives of the Lion of Summer. There are clear risks involved, so the civil service has prepared a [[fane|separate briefing on fanes]]. Although the magic involved is innovative, there is no doubt that it will work, but the approach has never been tried before in the Empire.

Discussions with the heralds of the Lion of Summer have revealed that the [[Jotun]] have long pursued this approach (or one very like it) and have ceded at least one fane to most of the Summer eternals. This is the method that they are using to secure the aid of Eleonaris in their war against the Empire (the Jotun have few ritualists with a fraction of the power of Imperial magicians).

To construct a fane, the Empire would need to locate a suitable [[regio]]. Not just any powerful summer regio will do, it must be one that is already under the influence of Eleonaris. Such things are not common but careful diplomacy with her servants has allowed the civil service to identify three possible sites.

### The Giltmere
[[Astolat#Weaving|Weaving]] in Astolat is a centre of learning for ritual magics, but it was also the birthplace of [[Adelmar the Lion]], who some people claim enjoyed the patronage of the Lion of Summer. Either way, she is known to have a fondness for the area, and the weavers in the area often report encounters with her heralds in the shallow foothills to the north of the town. The source of these encounters is a regio claimed by the Lion of Summer, a strange tarn called the Giltmere. Legend has it that there is a great ram that lives near the Giltmere whose scarlet and yellow coat burns with an inner fire. Weavers often scour the hillside looking for scraps of wool pulled from the great ram's coat. If you can collect enough of the scarlet thread it can be spun into a secret burning thread that is said to imbue any garment it is woven into with all the passion of the Summer realm.

### Oremont
Rather than cede the Giltmere to Eleonaris and allow her to claim it and the surrounding hills, the Empire could choose to build a fane on the sides of the Oremont. This huge mountain is one of several great peaks found in [[Hahnmark#Northspires|Northspires]], most of which tower over the surrounding countryside. The mountains here are rich in [[orichalcum]], which may explain the Lion of Summer's interest in the mountain. Oremont is not the tallest peak in Northspires, but there are ancient ruins halfway up the mountain that legends claim were once the home of a being called "Quiet solace before dawn breaks". The creator of the ruins is centuries gone, but the mountain retains a foreboding appearance, and locals claim that when lightning flashes during a storm it is possible to see [[Legendary_beasts#Gryphon|gryphons]] circling the peak.

## The Dangerous Choice
* A final alternative involves building a fane at the Semmerstones in Semmerholm
* The Semmerstones are currently not aligned with any one Summer eternal
* Recognising Eleonaris' claim to this powerful regio would win Eleonaris' approval but would greatly anger Meraud, Cathan Canae, and Jaheris
A large folly built somewhere suitable would be sufficient to demonstrate that the Empire was appropriately grateful for her aid. Her restrictions on the use of Knights of Glory would be lifted, and the Empire would be free to make use of her aid again, at least until the next time she decides to take umbrage. Creating a fane in either Giltmere or Oremont would achieve the same outcome but it would also win Eleonaris' approval. She would be positively inclined towards the Empire, and the fane would make it easier for the Empire to stay on her good side in the future. There is however one more option that the Empire could consider.

### The Semmerstones
[[Semmerholm#The_Semmerstones|The Semmerstones]] in Semmerholm is arguably the most famous Summer regio in the Empire. It is certainly one of the oldest and its power is said to rival that of the regio at Anvil, for the Summer realm at least. It has a long association with the Summer realm and has been a traditional meeting place for Dawnish Enchanters and emissaries of the Summer eternals for centuries. The regio is definitely not under the sway of Eleonaris, the Semmerstones are well known to be frequented by heralds in the service of many different Summer eternals.

However, the Commander of the Golden Armies has indicated that she would be prepared to send her armies to seize the reflection of the Semmerstones in the Summer Realm, if the Empire were to build a fane there and cede the site to her. Such an act would please Eleonaris greatly, granting her control of one of the most prestigious and powerful Summer regios in the Empire whilst simultaneously denying her rivals access to it. Her view of the Empire would be transformed overnight, turning from wroth to joy as quickly as the sun rises. Such a positive gift would be enough to persuade her to throw her weight solely behind the Empire and to withdraw the current support she grants the Jotun.

Of course, nothing good comes without a price. If the Empire chooses to cast in their lot with Eleonaris in this way, then it will enrage her three great rivals. [[Meraud]], [[Cathan Canae]], and [[Jaheris]] would all be furious at losing access to the Semmerstones to the Lion of Summer. It is impossible to be sure what the consequences of that would be, but none of these eternals are the kind of being to ignore such a slight. Their fury is certain to be every bit as intense as the current simmering rage of the Lion of Summer.

## Fanes
We've added the [[fane]] to the list of things the Imperial Senate can [[commission]]. It's possible to build these "embassies" with the cooperation of an eternal of any realm.

## Notes
Any of the commissions outlined here could be built at any time. The only time consideration is that Eleonaris' temper will not abate until the Empire commissions something. And the longer this current furore continues, the greater the chance that someone casts Knights of Glory and makes the Lion of Summer even more annoyed.
