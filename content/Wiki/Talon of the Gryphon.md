## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must possess the [[Combat skills#Weapon Master|weapon master]] skill.

 

### Effects
The target can spend a [[Heroic skills#Hero|hero point]] to call [[Calls#IMPALE|impale]] when wielding a [[Weapons & armour#One-handed Spears|one-handed spear]]. The target should give a loud bellow, roar, howl or cry when they use this ability.

In addition, the target experiences a powerful [[roleplaying effect]]; you feel strongly inclined to take immediate, bloody vengeance on anyone you think has wronged you, your friends, or your family. You also tend to suffer from a short fuse, and sudden attacks of savage temper.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 11. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description
This ritual allows a warrior to strike devastating blows with a one-handed spear that penetrate all but the strongest armour, piercing flesh and shattering bone. It brings with it a strong urge to take righteous vengeance against those who have wronged the target, fanning feelings of wrath and anger. The [[enchantment]] is often associated with the [[eternal]] [[Hayaak]], the Lord of Gryphons, who demonstrates a stormy temper and a strong sense of natural justice, revenge and an ability to hold grudges for a long period of time.  

The spell is sometimes called ''Horn of the Unicorn'', especially by the [[Navarr]] and those few [[Dawn|Dawnish]] ritualists who know the ritual. It is also known as the ''Narwhal's Harpoon'' in [[Wintermark]] and as the ''Stance of Harnessed Wrath'' by the [[Urizen]] battle magicians who use it to allow their allied [[Sentinel|sentinels]] to deliver pin-point, devastating strikes

## Common Elements
As an [[enchantment]] this ritual often involves giving the target a token or marking them or their weapon in some way. A toast may also be appropriate, especially one in which the target recalls their reasons for seeking the enchantment, or those who have wronged them in some way who will be made to pay (although many priests take a dim view of that kind of behaviour). This ritual often includes the use of the runes [[Verys]] or [[Feresh]] and invocations of [[Legendary beasts#Gryphon|gryphons]], narwhals or [[Legendary beasts#Unicorn|unicorns]].
