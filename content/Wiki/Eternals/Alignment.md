## Overview
The [[Declaration]] of [[Alignment]] is a critical tool used by the [[Imperial Conclave]] to interact with the Eternals, the supernatural denizens that inhabit the six Magical realms. It allows the Conclave to declare that a specific [[Eternal]] (or a defined group of eternals) is an ally or enemy of [[The Empire]], or remove one of those designations and restore the eternal to neutrality. These three states are often referred to as amity, enmity, or neutrality.
More than just a political and legal tool, this declaration has a known magical effect. Eternals who are subject to this declaration find their ability to interact with the Empire changes to reflect the Conclave's decision. An eternal that has amity for example finds it easier to dispatch heralds and wield its supernatural power within the bounds of the Empire, while one that has enmity finds it significantly harder to perform these actions. Amity or enmity toWards an eternal is considered to apply to all that eternal's heralds. 
Each ArchArchmage has the power to raise a single Declaration of Alignment each summit for an Eternal of their [[Realm]].
## Necessary Details
* The Declaration must name a specific Eternal or known group of affiliated eternals
* The Declaration must be clear if the Conclave is extending friendship, neutrality or hostility towards the Eternal
A Declaration of Alignment must name a single eternal or known group of eternals (such as the [[Whisper Gallery]], the [[Lictors]], or The Thrice-[[The Thrice-cursed Court]]). It must be clear whether that eternal is to become an ally of the Empire, an enemy of the Empire, or neither. Amity and enmity are often used in the wording of such a Declaration, but synonyms such as ally, friend, associate (for amity) or enemy, opponent, threat (for enmity) are acceptable.
It's not possible to place proVisos or time limits on a Declaration of Alignment. If the Conclave wishes to give an eternal amity for a year (for example) they must use the Declaration to grant them that status, and then after a year pass another declaration to remove that status. Likewise, it's not possible to declare that amity or enmity is dependent on a specific action or situation - an eternal either has amity or enmity or it does not.
Heralds and eternals
In recent years, the Conclave has extended amity or enmity towards a specific herald without rather than the patron eternal. During 381YE, a group of arcane scholars associated with the Lyceum undertook a number of experiments and investigations with the Assistance of the eternal [[Lashonar]] and its herald Ut'Ka. The outcome of these experiments proved something that had long been suspected; when a herald is given amity the supernatural effects apply also to the eternal. As far as the [[Hearth magic]] that underpins amity (and presumably enmity) is concerned, there is no difference between an eternal and its heralds. 
The ''legal'' status of amity and enmity still differentiates between the two, but by giving amity to Baxshula, Uk'ta and other heralds the Conclave inadvertently gave amity to the eternals [[Arhallogen]], [[Irra Harah]], Lashonar, and [[Llofir]] as well.
The legal guidance was thus updated to indicate that the Declaration must name a specific eternal, to avoid any possible confusion on this issue.
Examples: 
* The Imperial Conclave declares Irra Harah an ally of The Empire.
* The [[Archmage of Winter]] declares that [[Wise Rangara]] has the enmity of the Conclave
* Neutrality for [[Callidus]]
## Resolution
If the declaration passes, the result comes into effect a the end of the [[Conclave session]] as normal. The precise effects differ depending on which of the three versions of the declaration has been passed.
### Amity
* The eternal and their heralds are protected under [[Imperial Law]]
* The eternal and their heralds can attend Conclave sessions and be nominated to speak by a [[Grandmaster]]
* Their heralds find it much easier to enter The Empire and it is easier for the eternal to wield their powers there
The Conclave may declare a specific Eternal, and any associated heralds, an ally of the Conclave. Members of the Conclave are enCouraged to demonstrate courtesy and even aid these eternals, or their heralds, where it is possible for them to do so. This declaration automatically overturns a Declaration of Enmity. 
An eternal (and associated heralds) under declaration of amity gains the following legal rights, enforced by the magistrates.
* They receive protection under Imperial law
* They can attend Conclave meetings
* They may be nominated to speak before the Conclave by a grandmaster, although they cannot vote. The usual payment of crystal mana must still be made.
* They can make bequests to the vault of a specific order or to the Conclave as a whole. Bequests made to the Conclave as a whole are Generally dealt with using a Declaration of [[Endowment]].
The Declaration of Amity also has a significant magical effect. Eternals and their heralds find it easier to manifest in the Hall of Worlds and to move into [[Anvil]]. Eternals with amity also find it easier to wield their powers within The Empire; in many cases eternals require amity to be able to use their most powerful abilities.
In some cases, the Empire has successfUlly attracted the attention of an eternal they wished to initiate contact with through a Declaration of Amity or a Declaration of [[Concord]]. Success is rare however, by far the most effective way to get the attention of an eternal who is not currently interacting with the Empire is through the use of an [[Archmage]]'s plenipotentiary.
### Enmity
* The eternal and their heralds are considered to be barbarians for legal purposes
* Any ritual that draws on the power of the eternal is automatically interdicted
* Their heralds find it much harder to enter the Empire and it is harder for the eternal to wield their powers there
The Conclave may declare a specific Eternal to be an enemy of the Empire. If this declaration is made, it becomes dangerous for anyone to consort with the eternal named in this declaration, or with their heralds. It is not illegal to talk to an eternal with enmity (as is often incorrectly assumed) but the offender risks being declared a sorcerer, and can face investigation by a magistrate for treason. A Declaration of Enmity automatically overturns and replaces a Declaration of Amity.
An eternal (and associated heralds) under a Declaration of Enmity suffers the following consequences:
* Eternals and heralds under enmity are considered to be barbarians for legal purposes.
* Trading or dealing with an eternal under enmity is illegal and will be investigated as treason.
* Any ritual that deals directly with an eternal subject to enmity ([[Ephisis]]' Scale for Ephisis, [[Clarion Call of Ivory and Dust]] for [[Kaela]] or [[Missive for Sadogua]] for [[Sadogua]], for example) is automatically considered to be interdicted; magistrates may seek the assistance of the archmages to clarify which Rituals this effects, unless there is a separate Declaration of [[Interdiction]] against specific rituals.
* Any [[Magic]] item that was created by an eternal (or their heralds) under enmity is automatically considered to be interdicted.
As with the Declaration of Amity, this declaration also has significant magical effects. Eternals find it much harder to enter the Hall of Worlds. Heralds cannot use the portal in the Hall of Worlds to travel to Anvil without assistance from an Imperial citizen. There is significant evidence that heralds associated with an eternal under enmity find it extremely difficult or impossible to enter the Empire through any [[Regio]] without ritual assistance. They can still physically walk into the Empire if they enter the mortal world elsewhere however, so they are occasionally still encountered near the Empire's borders. 
The Archmage power of plenipotentiary circumvents the Declaration of Alignment to a small degree. An eternal formally invited to the Hall of Worlds for a parley may manifest itself or its servants regardless of its status with regard to these declarations.
### Neutrality
* Any Declaration of Amity or Enmity is automatically overturned and any benefits or penalties are removed
* Their heralds are no longer protected by Imperial law
This declaration removes either amity or enmity from the named eternal, returning them to a neutral legal status. Any benefits gained from, or penalties imposed by, the previous status are lost at the end of the conclave session.
The relationship with any eternal not listed as having either amity or enmity is neutral.
Heralds of neutral eternals are not protected by Imperial law - it is legal for them to be slain by Imperial citizens. They are however expected to abide by Imperial law while they are within the confines of the Empire.
