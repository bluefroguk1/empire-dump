## Description
A Thundering Drum allow a priest to use a musical performance to draw on the power of the [[Auras of Loyalty#Consecration|consecration]] of [[Loyalty]] to inspire their audience. Listeners are filled with a profound sense of the connections they have with other people, and reminded of the things they would be prepared to sacrifice their own lives to protect. The power of the magical musical instrument itself is only part of the process that brings about this spiritual experience - the performance itself helps connect the spirit of the audience with the power of the potent consecrated aura, and with the spirits of the other people sharing the same space with them.. 

These instruments may be any type of musical instrument but commonly takes the form of a straightforward instrument that may be struck. A common form is a simple drum or even tambourine, something that can be played to produce a tune that an audience or other participants in the ceremony can easily take up with clapped hands, stamped feet or instruments of their own. Indeed, it is the prevalence of such performances that gives the Thundering Drum its name - the thunder in question is the sound of a room full of people bound together for a few moments by the music of the priest. Such instruments have the advantage that they can easily be combined with song - and a group of the faithful singing a song together led by a priest can create a powerful experience all by itself.

Some artificers believe [[Loyalty]] is represented by [[Lann]], Rune of Bargains, and thus include this [[Runes|rune]] as part of the decoration of the instrument. As with many religious [[magic items|items]], it is common for a Chorus of the Righteous to be [[hallow|hallowed]]. A popular choice is the [[Auras of Loyalty#Hallowing of the Marked's Oath|Hallowing of the Marked's Oath]] - an audience of people inspired by the virtue of Loyalty makes a fertile recruiting ground.
