## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must possess the [[Combat skills#Weapon Master|weapon master]] skill.
 

### Effects
The target may call [[Calls#IMPALE|IMPALE]] three times each day with any [[Weapons_%26_armour#Great_weapons|great weapon]]. In addition they may react to any [[roleplaying effect]] that attempts to coerce them to follow another being by immediately lashing out at the source of that effect instead.

While under the [[enchantment]] they also experience a roleplaying effect: you find it difficult to tolerate anyone who you believe is trying to exert authority over you. In mild cases you might simply ignore them but in situation where you feel especially bullied or oppressed you find it difficult not to physically lash out at that person.





### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 11. Additional characters must be present throughout.
