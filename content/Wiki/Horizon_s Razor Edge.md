## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects
The target may call [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]] once each day with any [[Weapons_%26_armour#Weapons|melee weapon]] except a [[Weapons & armour#Pike|pike]]. 

While under the enchantment the target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]: you feel focused and ready, you are on the lookout for an opportunity to act decisively, achieving your goals with as little unnecessary effort as possible.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Every two additional characters increases the magnitude by 5. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description
With the power of this ritual, a warrior is granted clarity of purpose, empowered to strike a single decisive blow that can cripple a limb or render a lightly- or unarmoured opponent incapacitated with one swift strike. It is also known as ''Strike of Running Water'' among the [[Navarr]] who make good use of it with spear-and-shield fighting style, and as ''The Sentinel's Poise'' in parts of [[Urizen]].

This [[enchantment]] provides similar power to that granted by [[Swan's Cruel Wing]], a Summer ritual. When the ritual was entered into [[Imperial_lore#Imperial_Lore_and_the_Ritual_List|Imperial lore]] by the [[Dean of the Lyceum]] in 96YE there was some criticism - that there was little value in duplicating the power of Swan's Cruel Wing. At the time, the counterargument was made that while Summer magicians may excel at combative magic, their realm is not the only one that sees virtue in magic that allows warriors to strike decisive blows, and not every [[Bands#Covens|coven]] is trained in the lore of [[Summer magic|Summer]].

## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves both the target and their armoury. A ritualist might trace matching runes on weapons and warrior, or might encourage them to run through a weapon-drill. Some magicians encourage the targets to remain absolutely still, sometimes in an uncomfortable martial pose, until the climax of the ritual when they explode into action with a single dramatic strike. A toast of fresh water or fruit juice is often drunk, especially when the ritual is performed on a band of warriors rather than a single target. Legendary warriors, especially those who fought only when necessary, are often invoked as are [[Paragons and Exemplars]] who showed great patience 

Any of the [[Runes#Runes of Day|Day runes]] might be evoked. [[Cavul]], the rune of clarity and [[Aesh]], the rune of thought, are commonly marked on the weapon and the wielder respectively. An evocation of [[The Key]] may be appropriate with this ritual, as might evocations of creatures such as mantids or birds.
