Ice on the bitter earth
Black frost in the meadow
Dark trees in their winter death
Amid sharp, piercing snow

I don't know what he wants
I can't see what he's asking
But I am forever bound
To the song that he brings

Chorus: I will sing for the winter's dream
I will sing for the night
I will sing for the summer gone
I will sing for the light

I look in his ancient eyes
And I see my desires
There, 'neath my shadowed heart
Grows a dark, stirring fire

Clutched in his frozen arms
With his song in my head
A blanket of sparkling snow
Dwells my everlasting bed

Chorus

The music of boundless ice
Which has called since my birth
I have given my only love
To the dark, frozen earth
