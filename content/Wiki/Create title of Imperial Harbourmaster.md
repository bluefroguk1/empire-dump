In view of the construction of the Freeborn Navy, that the current ceremonial title of "Admiral"should be renamed "Imperial Harbourmaster" so as to avoid confusion when an Admiral is formally appointed to the Military Council.The powers of the Imperial Harbourmaster will be clarified and defined as follows:That its responsibilities be expanded to include coordination of merchant vessels as well as raiding ships and encouraging citizens to use them for virtuous purposes.That the Senate will devolve the Power to build or improve Great Works which affect fleet resources to this position.That it be granted the Power to Address the Senate once per summit on any and all matters pertaining to those responsibilities.The position will REMAIN an Imperial position appointed annually by the Senate, and should be re-appointed forthwith.''Proposed by Madruga, seconded by Sarvos''
