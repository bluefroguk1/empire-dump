__NOTOC__
I Sagua i'Ezmara, Master of Koboldi hereby announce that this season's project will be the Crucible of Fate in Zenith. The roads may be broken in Kahraman but the spirits are broken in Zenith. Rebuillding the workshop where the ushabti were first created will provide tools both spiritual and physical. This will be a focal point in defining their identity as a territory and cause a mandate opportunity for the Urizeni National Assembly. The funding is being organised by Zenith Ascendant, gathering prosperous donations from the people of Urizen. A full list of donors will be available on completion. They have gathered over half of the materials already and are continuing to receive more.
