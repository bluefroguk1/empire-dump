## Description
The Luminous Staff taps upon the power of the [[Day | Realm of Day]] to bring clarity of sight and thought to the bearer, increasing their ritual aptitude. These arcane implements are employed throughout the Empire to fortify the abilities of Day ritualists.

These often pure-white gleaming implements are usually engraved with [[Cavul]], the Rune of Purity and [[Aesh]], the Rune of Thought.

The [[Archmage#Staff_of_the_Archmage|staff]] of the [[Archmage]] of Day is a version of the luminous staff crafted to a secret pattern, and grants twice as much power to the wielder. 
## Rules

* Effect: Gain 1 rank of Day Lore, subject to the [[Realm_Lore#Gaining_additional_ranks|normal rules for effective skill]].
* Materials: Crafting a Luminous Staff requires the eleven measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], fourteen ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]] and twenty measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
