## Overview
The Ambassador to the Thule orcs of [[Otkodov]] is an [[Imperial title]] It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]].

Work on an embassy for the [[Thule]] [[orc|orcs]] was [[commission|commissioned]] in Summer 381YE by [[Construct_Embassy_to_the_Thule|order]] of the [[Imperial Senate]], and completed just before the Autumn Equinox that year. This followed on from some disagreements with the northern orcs about [[Spear_of_the_stars#Ambassador_to_the_Thule|how an ambassador might be appointed]] - they made clear that a uniquely [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[ambassador]] would be particularly appealing to them, to the point where a physical embassy would be unnecessary. The Imperial Senate declined their offer. 

The embassy itself stands in [[Miekarova]], just across the lake from Wendell's Hope in [[Miekarova#Mieriada|Mieriada]]. Isolated, snowed under for nearly half the year, the embassy is already seen as a poor posting for civil servants. By the time the embassy was completed the [[Varushka|Varushkan]] Juha the Cave Spider  of the Circle of Zulgan Tash was [[Appoint_Thule_Ambassador|already serving]] as ambassador for several seasons.

### Thule Merchants
The [[embassy]] in Miekarova means that the ambassador enjoys the benefits of [[Ambassador#Mercantile_Support|mercantile support]] from traders keen to curry their favour. As a [[ministry]], this allows them to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The ambassador spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] in Winter 382YE the cost to benefit from the [[ministry]] was increased by roughly a fifth.
### Heating Provision
During Spring 383YE, the ambassador of the time Yevgeni Katzev, liased with the civil service to arrange additional supplies for the embassy. This allows the ambassador to spend 1 crown to provide firewood to the Thule who live there. Apart from possibly improving the mood of Rak Who-Speaks-For-The-Dragons-Undivided in the colder months (which for Wendell's Hope is essentially every month except the very height of Summer), there is no tangible benefit for doing this.
