## Emilio's Herbarium
''Emilio’s Herbarium for Anvil Hospital'' stands on the wide plains of [[Sarvos#Foracci|Foracci]] near the outskirts of Rodez, adjacent to the grounds of the private Aldo di Saverio hospital. Entry to the Herbarium is through an old set of farm buildings, long vacant before they were renovated as part of the project, which now contain a small set of apartments for the use of the Keeper of Emilio’s Herbarium and their staff. It is the fourth project built by the Sarvos-based building society Red Raven Holdings, and thus shares similarities of styling with the [[Jade_Custodian#The_Wellspring_of_Jade|Wellspring of Jade]], [[Custodian_of_Glass_Point_Cove#Glass Point Cove|Glass Point Cove]] and [[Signori_d'Argento_Vine_Tender#Signori_d.27Argento_Vineyards|Signori d’Argento Vineyards]].

The main body of the Herbarium is a series of large weirwood covered trellises, the design adapted from the style of vineyard frame common in Foracci. Nestled among each other in interrupted concentric circles echoing common depictions of the labyrinth, it is easy for visitors to get lost among the stout scaffolding - though every path seems to lead back to the entrance eventually. This careful arrangement of herb beds provides a well-balanced mix of medicinal herbs, despite appearing as a random patchwork of different plants to the uninitiated.

Marked by Anvil Hospital’s well-known red-on-white Rhyv flag, the centre of the cultivation section contains a memorial to the Herbarium’s construction. A small diorama statue of two League citizens conversing with six Imperial Orcs sits above a plaque celebrating the commission.

In a quiet corner of the Herbarium, the staff has created a discreet shrine containing an icon of [[Cora Holdfast]], the [[Paragons_and_exemplars#Renowned_Exemplars|renowned exemplar]] of [[Loyalty]]. The triptych contains beautifully painted images of her founding the [[Anvil#The_Anvil_Hospital|Anvil Hospital and School of Medicine]]; creating the Book of Oaths; and protecting the sick as a member of the militia.
