## Overview
The Grimnir of Wittal Grove is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a [[Wintermark]] citizen. The motion to construct the Healing House of Wittal Grove was [[Construct Healing House of Wittal Grove|passed]] by the Imperial Senate during the Winter Solstice 383YE following an opportunity [[All_lift_together#Deep_in_the_marshes_of_Kallavesa|presented]] by Elina of Redleaf's Hall. 

## Responsibilities
The Grimnir of Wittal Grove is expected to oversee the Healing House of Wittal Grove. They have a responsibility to purchase surplus herbs from the grimnir who visit and to allow the herbalists of Kallavesa to respond to the needs of the heroes of Wintermark. If the Healing House of Wittal Grove were to be threatened in any way, however, it would be the responsibility of the Grimnir to deal with those threats.

## Power

Herbs
7 Crowns18 random [[herb|herbs]]
17 Crowns33 random herbs
30 Crowns50 random herbs
46 Crowns67 random herbs


### Ministry
As a [[ministry]], the title of Grimnir of Wittal Grove allows the holder to purchase quantities of [[herb|herbs]] at a set price. The Grimnir spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and herbs are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

### Bounty of the marshes
The Healing House of Wittal Grove is also a [[great work]] that provides a share of herbs to every [[herb garden]] in Kallavesa owned by a citizen of Wintermark. As standard this is a selection of random herbs however the Grimnir of Wittal Grove can make an announcement in the Imperial Senate to indicate which variety of herb they wish the herb masters to focus on.

If the Grimnir selects [[True Vervain|true vervain]], [[bladeroot]], [[marrowort]], or [[Imperial Roseweald|imperial roseweald]] the entire 90 herb bounty will be of this type. If they pick [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]] - a herb that struggles to prosper in Wintermark, even in the relatively temperate climate of Kallavesa - then the bounty is reduced to 45 herbs but again, every herb garden will benefit from added production of the rare healing herb. The Grimnir of Wittal Grove only needs to make an announcement to change the herb, either to a specific type or to return to no particular herbal focus.

No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Grimnir of Wittal Grove. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[veto]] over the Grimnir's decision.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice by unanimous decision of the [[senator|senators]] of [[Wintermark]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. The position of Grimnir of Wittal Grove is intended specifically to be held by a [[Wintermark_military_concerns#Grimnir|grimnir]]. Though there is no legal requirement for such a position, the halls who supported the construction are expected to withdraw support if anyone other than a grimnir is elected to the position.

The title can be held by a citizen of Wintermark. The Keeper can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wintermark [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
