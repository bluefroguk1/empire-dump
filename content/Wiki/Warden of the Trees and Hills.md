## Overview
The Warden of the Trees and Hills is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a [[Varushka|Varushkan]] citizen. [[Construct_Trees_and_Hills_merchant_hall|Commissioned]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Autumn 383YE in response to an [[The_honey_offering#The_Goose_and_the_Spider|influx of refugees]] from newly liberated [[Ossium]]. While the post was initially created to help find homes (and jobs) for former [[Druj]] slaves escorted to [[Karsk]] by the [[Thule]], the remit also in theory grants a certain degree of responsibility to protect the prosperity of the [[territory]] as a whole. The Senate did not specify where precisely to build it - Ivarsgard, Kosti, Moresvah, and Veresk were all mooted - and after some consultation with the people of Karsk the Civil Service decided to lay the foundations in [[Karsk#Ivarsgard|Ivarsgard]].

## Responsibilities
The Warden is responsible for overseeing the merchant hall built to organise the influx of refugees from [[Ossium]]. With those newcomers settled, the Warden is also responsible for keeping the prosperity of Karsk as a whole, and charged with mediating any disputes between mine and forest owners in the territory. If the Warden's Hall itself was ever directly threatened, the Warden would be responsible for dealing with those threats

As a [[ministry]], the title of Warden of the Trees and Hills allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials traded from the north at a set price. The Warden makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

==Appointment== 
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice by Varushkans who control [[forest]] and [[mine]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the forest or mine an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a Varushkan character may hold this title, but there is no requirement for them to be from Karsk (the title notionally involves encouraging trade throughout Varushka). They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse, they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## Warden's Hall
The Hall itself is a three-storey [[white granite]] round tower with a black slate roof that stands in the town of [[Karsk#Ivarsgard|Ivasrgard]]. It is remarkably secure; the windows have [[mithril|mithril-reinforced]] shutters and the doors can be sealed with heavy oak bars - on the outside as well as the inside. Much of the early work of the Hall involved ensuring that none of the would-be settlers in Karsk were in fact [[Varushkan Monster|monsters]], so the ability to seal the tower quickly was seen as admirable. These days it mostly serves as a place for those with jobs to offer to post notices, or interview potential candidates. The Warden themselves has apartments on the top floor - serviceable rather than luxurious - for when they are in residence rather than out on the roads visiting farms, mines, and forests across Karsk.
