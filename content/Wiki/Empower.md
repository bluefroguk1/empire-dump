## Description
This spell allows a magician to support heroic soldiers on the battlefield, helping them to use their martial skills at key moments. It is equally effective when used to grant strength to a neophyte warrior as to a veteran [[Heroic skills#Hero|hero]]. Anyone who can wield a weapon can benefit from the magical enhancement that empower provides.

It is often associated with the [[Dawn|Dawnish]]; there are many stories of [[Earl#Enchanter|enchanters]] using it to direct their fellow nobles. It is also popular with the [[Urizen]] both for supporting their [[Sentinel|sentinels]], and for directing a warrior to unleash a specific valuable attack at a pivotal moment in an engagement.

Some magicians view this spell as strengthening or inspiring their target. More cynical or arrogant magicians think of it in terms of using a warrior as a living weapon to achieve their aims on the battlefield. Magical scholars point to it as being similar to a short-lived [[enchantment]] - they draw parallels with magical rituals such as [[Swan's Cruel Wing]] or [[Horizon's Razor Edge]]. The magical energy provided by the spell is very short-lived, however, and does not interfere with a magical enchantment - meaning it can even be used to empower warriors who are already benefiting from more powerful magic such as [[Barked Command of the Iron Serjant]].

Several [[magic items]] exist that allow a magician to make more use of the empower incantation, such as the [[Roaring Chimera Rod]] and [[Glamourweave Robe]] which allow a magician to cast the spell many more times each day. The potent ritual [[Glorious Crown of Enchantment]] likewise increases the number of times the spell can be cast, with the additional advantage that its power can be replenished with the correct [[potion]] or access to a chamber enchanted to restore reserves of magical power. There is also a ritual - [[Stag Knight's Glory]] - that creates a very similar effect, potentially on a large group of combatants.

## Casting

## Effects
You may allow the target to make a single heroic call based on the weapon that they are using within 10 seconds. They may call [[Calls#STRIKEDOWN|STRIKEDOWN]] if they are wielding a [[Weapons & armour#Polearms|polearm]], [[Calls#IMPALE|IMPALE]] if they are wielding a [[Weapons & armour#Great weapons|great weapon]] or [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]] if they are wielding a [[Weapons & armour#One-handed_Weapons|one handed weapon]], or a [[Weapons & armour#One-handed_Spear|one handed spear]]. The target ''cannot'' use an [[Weapons & armour#Implements|implement]] to deliver an empowered blow.

## Common Elements
* Rune Magic: Any of the [[Runes#Runes_of_Summer|Gryphon Runes]] will serve caster and target well when invoked, though some prefer to invoke [[Hirmok]] or [[Cavul]] to lend expertise - granting the target "dominion" over their weapon or gifting them with "purity" to strike truly, rather than simply granting them strength. [[Mawrig]] may be invoked, particularly when the subject will use their new strength to cripple an enemy with a single blow.
* Astronomancy: [[The Oak]] is by far the most common of the constellations called upon when casting this spell, though as with invoking [[Cavul]], [[The Stork]] may also be used to imbue the subject with the skill needed to make a decisive strike. [[The Claw]] can be called upon, particularly when the subject will go on to [[Calls#CLEAVE|CLEAVE]] an enemy with their new strength, or more rarely, [[The Mountain]] may be used to lend monstrous strength to a [[Weapons_%26_armour#Polearms|polearm's]] [[Calls#STRIKEDOWN|STRIKEDOWN]].
* Dramaturgy: [[The Captain]] is strongly associated with this spell, both for the caster - one who gives strength to others - and for the subject, who strikes truly and Virtuously. [[The Bishop]] may also be invoked, lending strength to another.
* Blood Magic: A blood magician who is also a warrior may use their own blood, but more often the magician makes a small cut on the arm or shoulder of the target - enough to spill a little blood. Depending on the situation, the warrior may already be bleeding - and tracing a quick sigil in blood a warrior has already spilled while fighting has a strong resonance with this spell.
* Other traditions: A [[Dawn|Dawnish]] witch might evoke the spirit of the mythical [[Legendary_beasts#Unicorn|unicorn]] or the martial prowess of the [[Legendary_beasts#Chimera|chimera]] when casting this spell. A theurgist might invoke the name of a warrior-paragon such as [[Adelmar the Lion]], or the name of an inspirational figure known for wielding a specific weapon (for example, [[Inga Tarn]] might be evoked to aid someone using a two-handed weapon). A goeticist might call on [[Zakalwe]], [[Janon]], [[Estavus]], or almost any Summer eternal.
* Realms: This spell is strongly associated with the lore of the Summer realm. Some magicians - especially those who see themselves as directing or commanding the warriors around them - see a resonance with Autumn lore
