__NOTOC__
To expand the Halls of Knowledge to include an Autumn wing..''Proposed by Morrow, seconded by Miekarova.''
## Overview
* Expand the [[Morrow#The_Halls_of_Knowledge|Halls of Knowledge]] in [[Morrow#Peregro|Peregro]] to include a wing dedicated to the research of [[Autumn magic]].
* Passed in principle.
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## Cost
* The civil service have determined the costs for this expansion.
* 25 wains of mithril
* 25 wains of white granite
* 25 wains of weirwood
* 150 crowns
* six months to complete

## Progress
* 25 wains of mithril, 19 wains of weirwood, 1 wain of white granite, and 12 thrones provided by Agrippa after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* Due to the Druj invasion of Morrow, all progress on this project was lost. Agrippa received a partial refund after the Summer Solstice 382YE.

## Campaign Outcome
* The Druj [[382YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Lost_in_the_Echo_.28Morrow.29|invasion of Morrow]] resulted in the destruction of the Halls of Knowlege, and ended construction work. The contributor received a partial refund of materials and labour costs. This senate commission cannot now be completed.
* When complete, this would have allowed the [[Provost of the Halls of Knowledge]] the power to research Autumn magic at the rate of 15 ranks each season, and allowed them to spend money to enhance the speed of that research.
