## Description
This ceremonial tool generally takes the form of a drinking vessel - a cup, a goblet, a bowl, chalice, or even a drinking horn or tankard. It is used by priests of The Way to empower the ceremony of [[anointing]], allowing the creation of [[Religious skills#Ceremony Strength|durable]] auras, or the removal of the same. As part of the ceremony, it is common for a priest to mix a little [[liao]] with pure water, alcohol, or fruit juice. The priest takes a sip of the contents and passes the cup to the recipient who drinks deeply. A [[the Brass Coast|Freeborn]] priest might use a bowl of hot [[The_Brass_Coast_culture_and_customs#Syrah|syrah]], while a [[Navarr]] may add a little blood to the mix, possibly from a person who is already anointed with the aura desired or who has demonstrated strong virtue.

In [[Highguard]] and [[Urizen]], the item is much more likely to take the form of a bowl or basin into which fresh water or oil is poured. Rather than sharing a drink together, the priest may physically wash or anoint the hands and forehead of the target with the liao mixture, or hold the basin for the recipient to do so themselves. This is especially true when the intention of the ceremony is to remove an unwanted aura - the symbolism of washing away a spiritual taint is particularly strong.

Like many such regalia, it is common for a Pilgrim's Cup to be [[hallow|hallowed]], especially with a hallow that encourages the priest to seek out people in need of spiritual council or support in time of need.

## Rules

* Effect: When you [[Religious skills#Performing a Ceremony|perform]] or [[Religious skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with the performance of the [[anointing]] skill, you may spend up to three additional doses of [[liao]] to increase the [[Religious_skills#Ceremony_Strength|strength]] of the ceremony by the same amount.
* Materials: Crafting a Pilgrim's Cup requires six ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], five measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]], and seven measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
