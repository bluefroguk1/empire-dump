Though the [[Benefactor]] of Regalia cannot amend a title to add or remove responsibilities nor implement a restriction they are exceptionally well placed to identify such [[Opportunities|opportunities]] and their responsibility to secure items of regalia for Imperial titles could see them being recognised as the first point of contact for such offers.
