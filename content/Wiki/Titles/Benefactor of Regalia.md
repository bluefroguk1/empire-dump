## Overview
The [[Benefactor of Regalia]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] [[385YE Autumn Equinox Senate sessions#Create title of Benefactor of Regalia|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Autumn 385YE. They are charged with handling the permanent amendment of other Imperial titles to grant them legal ownership of certain items which are commonly called "''regalia''". The original motion to create the title stated that it would have the power to amend an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] once each session, this was amended by the Constitutional Court during scrutiny to instead be once each summit.
Occasionally an interested group, such as the [[Imperial Necromancer#Tools of the Trade|Black Tablet]], will offer a regular stipend or item to an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] if they have a certain responsibility or restriction. Though the [[Benefactor of Regalia]] cannot amend a title to add or remove responsibilities nor implement a restriction they are exceptionally well placed to identify such opportunities and their responsibility to secure items of regalia for Imperial titles could see them being recognised as the first point of contact for such offers.
## Responsibilities
The [[Benefactor of Regalia]] has a responsibility secure items of regalia for Imperial titles, and liaise with Imperial citizens who have valuable magical items they believe would help those titles fulfil their own responsibilities. By taking advice from the Conclave and Synod they can make judgements as to whether an item will actually be helpful to an Imperial title. Then, when they are satisfied they can use their power of announcement to permanently make such an item the legal property of another Imperial title.
## Powers
Oh aye that's exactly what they need. Does the Imperial [[Warmage]] need to carry around a half dozen artefact Quiet Words to dole out like Good Walder?
### Bestowing Regalia
Once per summit the Benefactor of Regalia can make an [[Senate announcement|announcement]] in the Senate to amend an Imperial title to grant it regalia. Only one Imperial title can be amended by the Benefactor of Regalia each season but any number of pieces of regalia can be granted to the title in a single announcement. To use this power the Benefactor of Regalia should provide the [[Speaker for the Senate]] with a written summary of what they are announcing so that it can be added to the agenda for the next Senate session. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Benefactor of Regalia. The Imperial Synod may, however, choose to exercise their veto over the Benefactor's decision.
## Appointment
The Benefactor of Regalia is appointed during the Winter Solstice each year. The title is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Highborn citizen, and they can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|Highborn National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
