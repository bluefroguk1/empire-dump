## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Bloody Great Sausage]] arose from an [[Opportunity]] presented in the lead-up to the [[Spring]] Equinox 382YE. The ''Right Virtuous Company of Provisioners and Victuallers'' of [[Holberg]] have long supplied the army of the [[Towerjacks]] with quality rations. Even when times were darkest, the spicers and sausagemakers of [[Holberg]] ensured that the rations were as palatable as possible, containing nothing to remind the soldiers of the ingredients they had been forced to use. With the breaking of the siege, the passes became clear and the farmland of [[Holberg]] was no longer drowning in [[Druj]]; the victuallers of the [[Towerjacks]] integrated with trademark efficiency into the logistics chain of the [[Imperial armies]]. But it does not have to stop there.
With the Blood Red Roads criss-crossing [[The Empire|the Empire]], the desirability of fine-quality sausages across [[The Empire|the Empire]] and the evident [[Prosperity]] of the Butchers of [[Temeschwar]] inspired the ''Provisioners and Victuallers'' to seek a new and exciting [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to diversify - one that Lorenzo “La Volpe” Macelliao von [[Temeschwar]]  was more than happy to invest in.
After they announced their intention to expand, the Virtuous Company Came under fire from other purveyors of fine food in [[Holberg]]. Some critics even went so far as to accuse them of attempting a scam, seeking to secure a monopoly on [[Holberg]] sausage. More sober individuals have pointed out that the scheme - to spread the distinctive Holberg sausage across [[The Empire|the Empire]] - works equally well whoever is in charge. Rather than simply entrusting the future of Holberg sausage to a single [[Guild|guild]], [[The Senate|the Senate]] chose to create an [[Imperial Title]] to bestow custodianship of the Bloody Great Sausage project on an Imperial citizen appointed by the Senators of [[The League]].
==Responsibilities== 
The Custodian is expected to spread fine quality Holberg victuals across [[The Empire|the Empire]], with a special emphasis on premium sausage. Anything that threatens the culinary arts of the north-eastern [[League]] city should be dealt with by the custodian.
## Powers
### Custodian
The title brings with it custodianship of the Bloody Great Sausage in Holberg.
### Luxurious Sausage
The Custodian has unparalleled access to fine quality sausage, and other excellent provisions produced in Holberg. Citizens from across [[The Empire|the Empire]] approach the Custodian with samples of their produce. While this has no game effect, the Custodian can use this to cultivate a reputation for gourmet feasting, or to explain easy access to exotic sausage, cheese, and other dishes.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Custodian of the Bloody Great Sausage]] is appointed during the [[Winter]] Solstice by unanimous decision of the senators of [[The League|the League]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a League citizen. The Custodian is appointed annually. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], [[The League|the League]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
