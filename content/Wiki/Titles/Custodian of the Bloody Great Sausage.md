## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Bloody Great Sausage]] arose from an [[Opportunity]] presented in the lead-up to the Spring Equinox 382YE. The ''Right Virtuous Company of Provisioners and Victuallers'' of [[Holberg]] have long supplied the army of the [[The League military concerns#The Towerjacks|Towerjacks]] with quality rations. Even when times were darkest, the spicers and sausagemakers of Holberg ensured that the rations were as palatable as possible, containing nothing to remind the soldiers of the ingredients they had been forced to use. With the breaking of the siege, the passes became clear and the farmland of Holberg was no longer drowning in [[Druj]]; the victuallers of the Towerjacks integrated with trademark efficiency into the logistics chain of the Imperial armies. But it does not have to stop there.
With the [[Lorenzo's Legacy#Blood Red Roads|Blood Red Roads]] criss-crossing the Empire, the desirability of fine-quality sausages across the Empire and the evident [[Prosperity]] of the Butchers of Temeschwar inspired the ''Provisioners and Victuallers'' to seek a new and exciting opportunity to diversify - one that Lorenzo “La Volpe” Macelliao von Temeschwar  was more than happy to invest in.
After they announced their intention to expand, the Virtuous Company Came under fire from other purveyors of fine food in Holberg. Some critics even went so far as to accuse them of attempting a scam, seeking to secure a monopoly on Holberg sausage. More sober individuals have pointed out that the scheme - to spread the distinctive Holberg sausage across the Empire - works equally well whoever is in charge. Rather than simply entrusting the future of Holberg sausage to a single guild, the Senate chose to create an [[Imperial Title]] to bestow [[New Imperial titles#Custodian|custodianship]] of the Bloody Great Sausage project on an Imperial citizen appointed by the Senators of [[The League]].
==Responsibilities== 
The Custodian is expected to spread fine quality Holberg victuals across the Empire, with a special emphasis on premium sausage. Anything that threatens the culinary arts of the north-eastern League city should be dealt with by the custodian.
## Powers
### Custodian
The title brings with it custodianship of the Bloody Great Sausage in Holberg.
### Luxurious Sausage
The Custodian has unparalleled access to fine quality sausage, and other excellent provisions produced in Holberg. Citizens from across the Empire approach the Custodian with samples of their produce. While this has no game effect, the Custodian can use this to cultivate a reputation for gourmet feasting, or to explain easy access to exotic sausage, cheese, and other dishes.
## Appointment
The [[Custodian of the Bloody Great Sausage]] is appointed during the Winter Solstice by unanimous decision of the [[Senator|senators]] of the League. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a League citizen. The Custodian is appointed annually. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the League [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
