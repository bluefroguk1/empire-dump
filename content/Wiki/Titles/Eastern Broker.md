## Overview
The Khiklotu Khrysoú are a loose alliance of Axou [[Traders|traders]] which the civil service suggest are equivalent to a Chamber of Commerce. Shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice 382YE, a trading post was established in Peakedge Song, created by Selenius as the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]]. The [[Eastern Broker]] is an [[Imperial Title]]  awarded to a [[Navarr]] citizen who oversees relations between the brokers of [[Therunin]] and those [[Axos]] merchants prepared to make the long trip north from the [[Bay of Catazar]] to trade with them.
Following the [[Mandate]] raised by Maximillian Ankarien in Summer 383YE, encouraging Imperial [[Traders|traders]] to seek out closer ties with the people of [[Axos]], an influx of traders from the Chambers of Issyk brought additional [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to the [[Eastern Broker]]. The merchants of Issyk brought [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]], [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], and [[Green iron|green iron]] to trade at the Brokerage. Shortly after the [[Winter]] Solstice 384YE the docks of Issyk were torched by the [[Grendel]] removing the extra [[Ministry|ministry]] from the Eastern [[Broker]]. Likewise the ongoing issues between the Citadels of Axos and [[The Empire|the Empire]] led to a reduction in goods offered in both [[Materials|materials]] and mana.
## Responsibilities
The Broker is expected to ensure trade continues between the Khiklotu Khrysoú and the [[Navarr]]. This close contact with the traders allows ample [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for the Broker to acquire supplies at bargain prices from the Axou merchants.

As a Ministry, the title of Eastern Broker allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The Broker makes their decision on how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed. Unlike a normal ministry, the broker has not one but ''two'' streams from which they can purchase material. The Broker can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 17 crowns on one, and 7 crowns on the other.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice by unanimous decision of the senators of Navarr. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a Navarr citizen. The Broker is appointed annually. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Navarr [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
