## Overview
The Khiklotu Khrysoú are a loose alliance of [[Axos|Axou]] traders which the civil service suggest are equivalent to a Chamber of Commerce. Shortly before the Summer Solstice 382YE, a trading post was established in [[Therunin#Peakedge Song|Peakedge Song]], [[Construct Peak Edge trading enclave|created]] by Selenius as the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]]. The [[Eastern Broker]] is an [[Imperial Title]]  awarded to a [[Navarr]] citizen who oversees relations between the brokers of [[Therunin]] and those Axos merchants prepared to make the long trip north from the [[Bay of Catazar]] to trade with them.
Following the [[Mandate]] [[383YE Summer Solstice Synod judgements#Judgement 27|raised]] by Maximillian Ankarien in Summer 383YE, encouraging Imperial traders to seek out closer ties with the people of Axos, an influx of traders from the Chambers of Issyk brought [[A mountain of vipers#Traders from Issyk|additional opportunities]] to the [[Eastern Broker]]. The merchants of Issyk brought cerulean mazzarine, ambergelt, and green iron to trade at the Brokerage. Shortly after the Winter Solstice 384YE the docks of Issyk were [[The falling sky#Trade with Axos|torched]] by the [[Grendel]] removing the extra ministry from the [[Eastern Broker]]. Likewise the ongoing issues between the Citadels of Axos and the Empire led to a reduction in goods offered in both materials and mana.
## Responsibilities
The Broker is expected to ensure trade continues between the Khiklotu Khrysoú and the Navarr. This close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Broker to acquire supplies at bargain prices from the Axou merchants.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of Eastern Broker allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The Broker makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed. Unlike a normal ministry, the broker has not one but ''two'' streams from which they can purchase material. The Broker can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 17 crowns on one, and 7 crowns on the other.
## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice by unanimous decision of the [[Senator|senators]] of [[Navarr]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a Navarr citizen. The Broker is appointed annually. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Navarr [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
