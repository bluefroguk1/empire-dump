## Overview
The [[Imperial Magus]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by [[Declaration]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]].
When it was initially created, the title was ''Conclave Liaison to the Senate'' and had only the right to address the Senate. At the Autumn Equinox summit 378YE the powers of the title were aMended, and re-titled Imperial Magus. During the Spring Equinox 379YE, the responsibilities of the title were further expanded to include a responsibility to keep the Imperial Conclave appraised of the Senate's position on Magical matters. 
During the Spring Equinox 384YE, the Senate expanded the powers of the Imperial Magus to include the Magus' Precedence, allowing them to raise a single Declaration each summit that supersedes the usual running order of the agenda. There were some some concerns among the Constitutional Court about this change, but they chose not to [[Challenge]] it.
## Responsibilities
The Imperial Magus is expected to take responsibility for providing the Senate with advice on magical matters. Following further discussion, these responsibilities were expanded to give the Imperial Magus the responsibility to adVise the Imperial Conclave of the Senate's position on magical matters.
