## Overview
The [[Crystal [[Architect]] of the Spires]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the Senators of [[Urizen]], Empowered to [[Commission]] structures that produce valuable crystal mana. The title was created at the Spring Equinox summit of 379YE, and was one of the titles aMended in Spring 380YE following the need to restrict the number of projects commissioned each season.
As of the end of the Autumn Equinox 381YE, the Crystal Architect has commissioned three Sinecures: the Caves of [[The Claw]] in [[Morrow]], and the Tower of the Fall and the Storm Vault in [[Zenith]].
==Responsibilities== 
The Crystal Architect is responsible for overseeing the creation of mana sinecures in Urizen. They can only authorise construction in [[Urizen Territories]], and they can only authorise the construction of structures that provide mana - not votes of any sort.
## Powers
### Commission construction of mana structures
Once per summit, the Crystal Architect can Commission the construction of structures in Urizen that will produce mana crystals or [[Vis]]. The [[Materials]] required for construction are provided by the Crystal Architect.  Each such commission automatically creates a [[Sinecure]], one that is appointed by unanimous decision of the Urizen senators. Control of the sinecure is a lifetime title, unless it is revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Assembly of Nine, or the Urizen Assembly.
To use this power, the Crystal Architect provides an announcement to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Crystal Architect. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Crystal Architect's decision.
When it was created, this power was unlimited. The Senate chose to amend the powers during the Spring Equinox 380YE as part of an administrative motion. The Senate chose to amend the powers further during the Winter Solstice 383YE to include the commission of structures that produce vis. 
Because this is a national position, the title can only be held by a citizen of Urizen.
## [[Appointment]]
The Crystal Architect of the Spires is appointed during the Spring Equinox each year. It is chosen by unanimous decision of the Urizen senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Urizen citizen. They can be revoked by the General Assembly, the Urizen National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
