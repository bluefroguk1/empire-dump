## Overview
The [[Crystal Architect of the Spires]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the [[Senator|senators]] of [[Urizen]], empowered to [[Commission]] structures that produce valuable crystal mana. The title was [[Create title of Crystal Architect of the Spires |created]] at the Spring Equinox summit of 379YE, and was one of the titles [[Amend powers of the Crystal Architect of the Spires|amended]] in Spring 380YE following the need to restrict the number of projects commissioned each season.
As of the end of the Autumn Equinox 381YE, the Crystal Architect has commissioned three [[Sinecure|sinecures]]: the [[Custodian of the Claw#The Caves of the Claw|Caves of the Claw]] in [[Morrow]], and the [[Keeper of the Tower of the Fall#The Tower of the Fall|Tower of the Fall]] and the [[Custodian of the Storm Vault#The Storm Vault|Storm Vault]] in [[Zenith]].
==Responsibilities== 
The Crystal Architect is responsible for overseeing the creation of mana [[Sinecure|sinecures]] in [[Urizen]]. They can only authorise construction in Urizen [[Territory|territories]], and they can only authorise the construction of structures that provide mana - not votes of any sort.
## Powers
### Commission construction of mana structures
Once per summit, the Crystal Architect can [[Commission]] the construction of structures in Urizen that will produce mana crystals or [[Vis]]. The materials required for construction are provided by the Crystal Architect.  Each such commission automatically creates a [[Sinecure]], one that is appointed by unanimous decision of the Urizen senators. Control of the sinecure is a lifetime title, unless it is revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Assembly of Nine, or the Urizen Assembly.
To use this power, the Crystal Architect provides an [[Senate announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Crystal Architect. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Crystal Architect's decision.
When it was created, this power was unlimited. The Senate chose to [[Amend powers of the Crystal Architect of the Spires|amend]] the powers during the Spring Equinox 380YE as part of an administrative motion. The Senate chose to [[383YE Winter Solstice Senate sessions#Amend Crystal Architect of the Spires|amend]] the powers further during the Winter Solstice 383YE to include the commission of structures that produce vis. 
Because this is a national position, the title can only be held by a citizen of Urizen.
## Appointment
The [[Crystal Architect of the Spires]] is appointed during the Spring Equinox each year. It is chosen by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Urizen citizen. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Urizen [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
