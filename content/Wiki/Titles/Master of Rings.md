## Overview
The [[Master of Rings]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[The League]]. The Department of Architecture was [[Construct Department of Architecture|commissioned]] by the Imperial Senate during the Winter Solstice 384YE following an [[Back in the same place#A Prestigious New University|opportunity]] created by an [[Appraisal]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Master of Rings]] is responsible for using their power to generate as much wealth as possible for the merchant-princes of Temeschwar, and for the League, as possible. If the Temeschwar University Department of Architecture were to be threatened, it would be the responsibility of the Master to face those threats; likewise should any [[Opportunity]] related to the Department arise they would decide how to respond.
## Powers
### Commission
Once during each summit, the [[Master of Rings]] can [[Commission]] the construction of a [[College of Magic]], [[Embassy]], [[Fane]], [[Folly]], [[Great work]], [[Ministry]], [[Runeforge]], or [[Sinecure]]. This project does ''not'' count against the limited number of commissions the Senate can begin each season - all the work of planning and construction is undertaken by the Department of Architecture. The materials and money required for construction must be provided by the Master or their agents.
If the Master of Rings announces the commission of a sinecure or ministry then an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the commission is automatically created. The location and size of the commission and the method of appointment and tenure of any associated title are all part of the [[Motion wording#Necessary Details|necessary details]] and may be included in the announcement made by the Master or determined later by them.
The Master of Rings cannot use their power of announcement to [[Commission#Altering an Existing Commission|alter an existing commission]]. The Master of Rings does not have the power of [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Concedence|concedence]] so whilst they can commission a fane it would still be the decision of the Imperial Senate whether to cede it to an [[Eternal]].

### Ministry
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Master of Rings allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The Master makes their decision on how much to spend during downtime from their character page. Resources are removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
Unlike a standard ministry, the Master of Rings deals with a number of different groups of traders from across the [[Northern trade network]], [[Varushka]], and the League cities.  As such, the Master has not one but ''three'' streams from which they can purchase material. The Master can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 75 crowns on 3 wains of weirwood, 150 crowns on 6 wains of mithril, and 150 crowns on 6 wains of white granite.
## Temeschwar University Department of Architecture
The Temeschwar University Department of Architecture stands proudly on the city’s north side as the most northerly academic institution in the League. It is a foreboding, solid-looking building reinforced with white granite with grand pointed arched windows, a looming grey high-sloped roof, and surmounted by a vast glass dome. The main entrance door is made of two enormous planks of weirwood engraved with the likenesses of famous builders like Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar; Lepidus, the paragon of Pride and the builder of Bastion; and Karo di Yedinso, the Department’s founder. One lower quarter of the door is given over to a scene of faceless, androgynous characters in the fashions of Temeschwar gathered around a drafting table intended to allow students to see themselves amongst these great individuals.
The inside of the building is dominated by a grand open hall. Great mirrors cunningly placed around the inside of the building ensure that no sunlight is wasted, and during the day shadows are chased almost to oblivion. The walls are panelled in wood taken from the forests of Temeschwar. They are simply carved, relying on the tapestries displaying the crests of prominent guilds to add colour and deaden echoes. Around the hall hang portraits of austere, dour figures from the great guilds of the city that contribute to the Master of Rings’ position. At the hall’s centre, in between the great pillars holding up the roof is the department’s small library. Rows of shelves, desks, and drafting tables sit directly beneath the dome to take advantage of the light that streams in from above. The stone floor is decorated as one great labyrinth in black and white stone. Its tiles lead to seven lecture theatres around the edge, each named for a different Virtue.
The suite of the Master of Rings sits close to the back of the hall. In contrast to the spaciousness and grandeur of the building, it is a small group of rooms designed to hold intimate and private meetings. Its spaces are gently lit by a warm fireplace and torches. Its firm couches, oaken desk, and regularly-refilled spirits-cabinet have been carefully arranged to facilitate the kinds of deals necessary for the Master to acquire the materials they need from the guilds of Temeschwar.
## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice. The Master of Rings is appointed by citizens of the League who control a [[Business]] [[Resource|personal resource]]. The larger the business an individual has the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only a citizen of the League may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
