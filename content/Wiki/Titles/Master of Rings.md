## Overview
The [[Master of Rings]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[The League]]. The Department of Architecture was commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the [[Winter]] Solstice 384YE following an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] created by an [[Appraisal]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Master of Rings]] is responsible for using their power to generate as much wealth as possible for the merchant-princes of [[Temeschwar]], and for [[The League|the League]], as possible. If the [[Temeschwar]] University Department of Architecture were to be threatened, it would be the responsibility of the Master to face those threats; likewise should any [[Opportunity]] related to the Department arise they would decide how to respond.
## Powers
### [[Commission]]
Once during each summit, the [[Master of Rings]] can [[Commission]] the construction of a [[College of Magic]], [[Embassy]], [[Fane]], [[Folly]], [[Great work]], [[Ministry]], [[Runeforge]], or [[Sinecure]]. This project does ''not'' count against the limited number of commissions [[The Senate|the Senate]] can begin each season - all the work of planning and construction is undertaken by the Department of Architecture. The [[Materials|materials]] and money required for construction must be provided by the Master or their agents.
If the [[Master of Rings]] announces the [[Commission|commission]] of a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] or [[Ministry|ministry]] then an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the [[Commission|commission]] is automatically created. The location and size of the [[Commission|commission]] and the method of [[Appointment|appointment]] and [[Tenure|tenure]] of any associated title are all part of the necessary details and may be included in the announcement made by the Master or determined later by them.
The [[Master of Rings]] cannot use their power of announcement to alter an existing commission. The Master of Rings does not have the power of concedence so whilst they can commission a [[Fane|fane]] it would still be the decision of the [[Imperial Senate]] whether to cede it to an [[Eternal]].

### [[Ministry]]
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Master of Rings allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] at a set price. The Master makes their decision on how much to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Resources are removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
Unlike a standard [[Ministry|ministry]], the Master of Rings deals with a number of different [[Groups|groups]] of [[Traders|traders]] from across the [[Northern trade network]], [[Varushka]], and the [[League]] cities.  As such, the Master has not one but ''three'' streams from which they can purchase material. The Master can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 75 crowns on 3 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], 150 crowns on 6 wains of [[Mithril|mithril]], and 150 crowns on 6 wains of [[White granite|white granite]].
## [[Temeschwar]] University Department of Architecture
The [[Temeschwar]] University Department of Architecture stands proudly on the city’s north side as the most northerly academic institution in [[The League|the League]]. It is a foreboding, solid-looking building reinforced with [[White granite|white granite]] with grand pointed arched windows, a looming grey high-sloped roof, and surmounted by a vast glass dome. The main entrance door is made of two enormous planks of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] engraved with the likenesses of famous builders like Lorenzo Macelliao von [[Temeschwar]]; [[Lepidus]], the [[Paragon|paragon]] of [[Pride]] and the builder of [[Bastion]]; and Karo di Yedinso, the Department’s founder. One lower quarter of [[The Door|the door]] is given over to a scene of faceless, androgynous [[Characters|characters]] in the fashions of Temeschwar gathered around a drafting table intended to allow students to see themselves amongst these great individuals.
The inside of the building is dominated by a grand open hall. Great mirrors cunningly placed around the inside of the building ensure that no sunlight is wasted, and during the [[Day|day]] shadows are chased almost to oblivion. The walls are panelled in wood taken from the forests of Temeschwar. They are simply carved, relying on the tapestries displaying the crests of prominent [[Guilds|guilds]] to add colour and deaden echoes. Around the hall hang portraits of austere, dour figures from the great guilds of the city that contribute to the Master of Rings’ position. At the hall’s centre, in between the great pillars holding up the roof is the department’s small library. Rows of shelves, desks, and drafting tables sit directly beneath the dome to take advantage of the light that streams in from above. The stone floor is decorated as one great labyrinth in [[Black and white|black and white]] stone. Its tiles lead to seven lecture theatres around the edge, each named for a different Virtue.
The suite of the Master of Rings sits close to the back of the hall. In contrast to the spaciousness and grandeur of the building, it is a small group of rooms designed to hold intimate and private meetings. Its spaces are gently lit by a warm fireplace and torches. Its firm couches, oaken desk, and regularly-refilled spirits-cabinet have been carefully arranged to facilitate the kinds of deals necessary for the Master to acquire the [[Materials|materials]] they need from the guilds of Temeschwar.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the [[Summer]] Solstice. The Master of Rings is appointed by citizens of [[The League|the League]] who control a [[Business]] personal [[Resource|resource]]. The larger the business an individual has the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only a citizen of [[The League|the League]] may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
