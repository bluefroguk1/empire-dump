## Overview
The [[Singing Caves]] are located near [[Mournwold#Overton|Overton]] in the [[The Marches|Marcher]] [[Territory]] of [[Mournwold]]. Custodianship of the [[Singing Caves]] grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable mithril.
## The Resource
The [[Singing Caves]] are found in [[Mournwold]] not far from the town of [[Mournwold#Overton|Overton]]. Still in Imperial hands, albeit only just, the Singing Caves take their name from the strange voices that echo forth when the wind blows above.  Local stories claim that the mines were first discovered by the folk hero [[#Jonah Gold|Jonah Gold]] in pre-Imperial times while following a particularly rich seam of green iron  Fanciful tales suggest that one of the voices that seem to issue from the cave is that of that legendary miner issuing dire warnings of future mining disasters.
Studies of the voices suggest that they are almost certainly a natural phenomenon, but there is a persistent tale of a voice crying "Rise, Marchers, rise!" that seemed to issue from the cave a month before the first [[Jotun]] troops crossed the border into the Mournwold. The bizarre occurrence was well documented at the time, but the ensuing invasion left little time for deeper investigation. Those few scholars who have made the trip out to the besieged [[Territory]] were at a loss to explain the event - but came away largely convinced of its veracity following interviews with the miners.
Found on the northern borders of the [[#Greensward|Greensward]], the last few decades have seen some tension between the miners and the citizens of Overton. The Singing Caves are an Imperial Bourse seat, not a Marcher national seat - something that causes resentment among many Mournwolders to this day. Several outspoken Marchers, including the previous [[Monastery|abbot]] of [[Mournwold#Greensward|Greensward Monastery]], have claimed that the owners of the Singing Caves have relied on Marcher sweat and blood to protect their investment. Indeed, no Marcher had held the Singing Caves Bourse Seat in the two decades before it was allocated as a national position - instead, it was held by a citizen of [[The League|League]] (most commonly one representing one of the [[Tassato|Tassatan]] guilds. Any Marcher miner who worked the Singing Caves under a "foreign" Seat is given short shrift by their neighbours - in pre-invasion times it was not uncommon for them to experience the [[The Marches culture and customs#Rough music|rough music]]. On nights where the beer and cider is flowing, there was grim talk of demanding that the Caves be given over to the Marchers if the Mournwold was ever liberated - although the legality of such a position is dubious at best.
For a short time in late 380YE, the Singing Caves were taken by the Jotun orcs. They were recovered shortly afterwards, but the legal situation was clear - as a resource liberated from barbarians the Imperial Senate was required to [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Allocation|allocate]] them again. A Marcher lobby persuaded the Senate to [[Allocate the Singing Caves|allocate them to the Marches]] as a national position, but the motion was immediately [[The Throne#Power of Veto|vetoed]] by [[Empress Lisabetta]], leaving the mines unallocated. They will be eligible to be allocated again during the Winter 380YE summit.
They were [[Allocate the Singing Caves Spring 382YE|eventually allocated]] as a National Bourse position during the Spring Equinox 382YE, by which time a significant bounty of mithril had built up that became the property of Abbott Thomas Arch when they gained the seat.
The Imperial Senate [[Construct Lowther's Lift|commissioned]] the construction of a deep lift following an [[Wildest dreams#The Deep Mine|opportunity]] that arose when a group of miners were led to a hidden bounty of mithril deep beneath the Singing Caves by [[Jonah Gold]].
## The Bourse Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of mithril which is theirs to do with as they will. If the Singing Caves were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Singing Caves, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Singing Caves comes with a seat on the Imperial Bourse. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of mithril
The Seat has control of a source of mithril and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 28 Imperial wains of mithril every season.
### Attract mine workers
Attract mine workers
72 crowns3 wains of mithril
168 crowns6 wains of mithril
288 crowns9 wains of mithril
432 crowns12 wains of mithril
The Custodian has access to a [[Ministry]] that allows them to fund mine workers that will allow them to acquire quantities of [[Mithril]] at a set price. The Custodian of the Singing Caves spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
### Appointment
As with all mithril Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the Autumn Equinox. Control of the Singing Caves is assigned to whichever Marcher candidate receives the most support from [[Farm]] owners. Votes are recorded in private in conjunction with the civil servants who support the Bourse.
Custodianship of the Singing Caves is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
