## Overview
The [[Singing Caves]] are located near Overton in the Marcher [[Territory]] of [[Mournwold]]. Custodianship of the [[Singing Caves]] grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Mithril|mithril]].
## The [[Resource]]
The [[Singing Caves]] are found in [[Mournwold]] not far from the town of Overton. Still in Imperial hands, albeit only just, the [[Singing Caves]] take their name from the strange voices that echo forth when the wind blows above.  Local stories claim that the mines were first discovered by the folk hero [[Jonah Gold]] in pre-Imperial times while following a particularly rich seam of [[Green iron|green iron]]  Fanciful tales suggest that one of the voices that seem to issue from the cave is that of that legendary miner issuing dire warnings of future mining disasters.
Studies of the voices suggest that they are almost certainly a natural phenomenon, but there is a persistent tale of a voice crying "Rise, Marchers, rise!" that seemed to issue from the cave a month before the first [[Jotun]] troops crossed the border into the [[Mournwold]]. The bizarre occurrence was well documented at the time, but the ensuing invasion left little time for deeper investigation. Those few scholars who have made the trip out to the besieged Territory were at a loss to explain the event - but came away largely convinced of its veracity following interviews with the miners.
Found on the northern borders of the Greensward, the last few decades have seen some tension between the miners and the citizens of Overton. The [[Singing Caves]] are an [[Imperial Bourse]] seat, not a Marcher national seat - something that causes resentment among many Mournwolders to this [[Day|day]]. Several outspoken Marchers, including the previous abbot of Greensward [[Monastery]], have claimed that the owners of the Singing Caves have relied on Marcher sweat and blood to protect their investment. Indeed, no Marcher had held the Singing Caves [[Bourse]] Seat in the two decades before it was allocated as a national position - instead, it was held by a citizen of [[League]] (most commonly one representing one of the Tassatan [[Guilds|guilds]]. Any Marcher miner who worked the Singing Caves under a "foreign" Seat is given short shrift by their neighbours - in pre-invasion times it was not uncommon for them to experience the rough [[Music|music]]. On nights where the beer and cider is flowing, there was grim talk of demanding that the Caves be given over to the Marchers if the [[Mournwold]] was ever [[Liberated|liberated]] - although the legality of such a position is dubious at best.
For a short time in late 380YE, the Singing Caves were taken by the [[Jotun]] orcs. They were recovered shortly afterwards, but the legal situation was clear - as a resource [[Liberated|liberated]] from [[Barbarians|barbarians]] the [[Imperial Senate]] was required to allocate them again. A Marcher lobby persuaded [[The Senate|the Senate]] to allocate them to [[The Marches|the Marches]] as a national position, but the motion was immediately vetoed by [[Empress Lisabetta]], leaving the mines unallocated. They [[Will|will]] be eligible to be allocated again during the [[Winter]] 380YE summit.
They were eventually allocated as a National Bourse position during the [[Spring]] Equinox 382YE, by which time a significant bounty of [[Mithril|mithril]] had built up that became the property of Abbott Thomas Arch when they gained the seat.
The [[Imperial Senate]] commissioned the construction of a deep lift following an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] that arose when a group of miners were led to a hidden bounty of [[Mithril|mithril]] deep beneath the Singing Caves by [[Jonah Gold]].
## [[The Bourse]] Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Mithril|mithril]] which is theirs to do with as they [[Will|will]]. If the Singing Caves were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Singing Caves, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Singing Caves comes with a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the [[Imperial Bourse]] as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of [[Mithril|mithril]]
The Seat has control of a source of mithril and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 28 Imperial wains of mithril every season.
### Attract [[Mine|mine]] workers

72 crowns3 wains of mithril

432 crowns12 wains of mithril
The Custodian has access to a [[Ministry]] that allows them to fund [[Mine|mine]] workers that [[Will|will]] allow them to acquire quantities of Mithril at a set price. The Custodian of the Singing Caves spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all mithril Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the [[Autumn]] Equinox. Control of the Singing Caves is assigned to whichever Marcher candidate receives the most support from [[Farm]] owners. Votes are recorded in private in conjunction with the civil servants who support the Bourse.
Custodianship of the Singing Caves is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An [[Imperial Bourse]] seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
