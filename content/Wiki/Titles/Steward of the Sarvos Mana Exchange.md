The title can be held by a citizen of [[The League|the League]]. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the League [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Sarvos Mana Exchange
The Sarvos Mana Exchange was commissioned by Cesare Sanguineo Rezia Di [[Tassato]] of the Gilded Horn Carta during the [[Winter]] Solstice 381YE  to take advantage of an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to construct branches of the [[Tassato]] Mana Exchange in other League cities. The work was paid for and completed by Lorenzo 'La Volpe' of the Bloody Butchers [[Guild]] of [[Temeschwar]] whose construction of the great works known as Lorenzo's Legacies of Virtue had led to a significant increase in mana production.
The market follows a similar design to the [[Temeschwar]] Mana Exchange which was built at the same time. A four storey building with multi-levelled [[White granite|white granite]] porticoes houses the Exchange. Several sublevels house reinforced vaults and [[Mithril|mithril]]-infused wards against scrying and intrusion. The business of the Mana Exchange is the sale and purchase of crystal mana. While many of the customers are League citizens, the Exchange is open to customers from across [[The Empire|the Empire]] and beyond. 
As with the Temeschwar branch, Lorenzo wanted to build the Exchange in or near a large meat market, but such things are not common in Sarvos proper - abattoirs and meat markets are much more common on the mainland . Rather the Mana Exchange stands on Salsiccia Street, a narrow avenue known for its artisanal butchers and gourmet sausage makers. As with other structures paid for by ''La Volpe'', heraldry of the  Butchers [[Guild]] and images of crossed cleavers and blood drops are prominently displayed throughout the building.
Following the decision of the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 384YE, the exchange was expanded slightly to allow the civil service to increase the amount of mana they could purchase on behalf off the grandmasters of the [[Imperial Conclave]].
