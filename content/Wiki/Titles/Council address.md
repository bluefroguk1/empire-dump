I've heard what [[General]] Igund suggests and I have a counter proposal; I Warn you now, it involves less [[Heroism]] and fewer dead soldiers. Nobody wins a [[War]] by dying. You win a war by making the other bastards die in such numbers that they run back across The Mountains with their scaly tails between their legs.
## Overview
A [[Council address]] is an Opportunity for an individual to speak to the [[Imperial Military Council]] during a [[Council session]]. Only a handful of Imperial Titles confer the right to address the Military Council, .
The Senate may create [[New Imperial titles]] with this power if they wish; this is most appropriate where the holder of the title does not attend Military Council meetings, but has responsibilities that require them to report to the Military Council.
## Procedure
### Raising an address
An Imperial citizen who has the right to address the Military Council may do so by informing the [[Herald of the Council]] of their intention. The Herald will add the item to the agenda for the next session. The Herald will record the general nature of the address, and a citizen who deviates dramatically from their declared topic risks censure.
The citizen should ensure that they are present at [[The Chamber]] at the start of the session. They are likely to be called Early as addresses are usually dealt with before other agenda items, but after reports from the [[Field Marshal]] and the Herald.
### Presentation
The citizen making an address will be allowed five minutes to speak during which those present are expected to remain reasonably quiet. The purpose of an address is to present the Council with information that is of interest to them, or to request their Assistance. Individuals who try the Council's patience by talking too long on a subject that it is clearly of diminishing interest to everyone present may be directed to conclude their address early by the Herald.
### Discussion
After the presentation is complete, the Herald may allow some time for members of the Council to ask questions and for the speaker to reply. The amount of time allocated to such discussions depends entirely on how much additional business the Military Council has. It is possible that discussion will have to be perfunctory.
### Decision
It is possible that the address will require the Military Council to make a decision - either to use on of its powers or to otherwise present a collective opinion. If necessary, the Herald will call for a vote.
