## Overview
The [[Spear of the Seven]] is an [[Imperial Title]] aWarded to a citizen of [[Navarr]]. Construction of the Hall of the Seven was announced by Bertrand as Bearer of the First Imperial Wayleave during the Spring Equinox 385YE following an [[Opportunity]] presented to take advantage of the inspiration presented by the knights of [[Dawn]] to the Thorns of Navarr.
## Responsibilities
The Spear of the Seven is expected to support Imperial [[Heroes]] Fighting The [[The Vallorn]], to organise captains to support the struggle against the [[Vallorn]], and to gather resources to [[Empower]] and assist efforts against The the vallorn and vallornspawn.

As a Ministry, the title of Spear of the Seven allows the holder to purchase goods at a set price. The Spear makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
## Hall of the Seven
The Hall of the Seven is a dedicated [[Wayhouse]] in [[Miaren]] originally proposed by ''Asoli Briarbark''. In the courtyard of the wayhouse stands two plain statues; one of a [[Thorn]] with a small plaque that names them as Corwyn Heartsbane and credits them for funding construction of the wayhouse. The other statue is of a [[Brand]] with a plaque that reads "''In memory of Amaan Embercast, who fought the vallorn with all seven Virtues, and died protecting [[The Empire]]. Though his body may be forever lost, his memory stands here in his dear Miaren.''"
In the wayhouse proper there is a large painting depicting Arlen Foreman-Smith of House Tallstag, Farren Silver Streams, and Corwyn Heartsbane shaking hands. A small etching notes that this is in [[Recognition]] of the work done by the Reeve of the GreenForest Fair, Farren Silver Streams, and Corwyn Heartsbane in securing The Wayleave required to make this building possible.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox by unanimous decision of the Senators of Navarr. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a Navarr citizen. The Spear of the Seven is appointed annually. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Navarr National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
