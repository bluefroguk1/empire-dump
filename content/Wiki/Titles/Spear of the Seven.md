## Hall of the Seven
The Hall of the Seven is a dedicated [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]] in [[Miaren]] originally proposed by ''Asoli Briarbark''. In the courtyard of the [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]] stands two plain statues; one of a [[Thorn|thorn]] with a small plaque that names them as Corwyn Heartsbane and credits them for funding construction of the [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]]. The other statue is of a [[Brand|brand]] with a plaque that reads "''In memory of Amaan Embercast, who fought the [[Vallorn|vallorn]] with all seven Virtues, and died protecting [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Though his body may be forever lost, his memory stands here in his dear [[Miaren]].''"
In the [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]] proper there is a large painting depicting Arlen Foreman-Smith of House Tallstag, Farren Silver Streams, and Corwyn Heartsbane shaking hands. A small etching notes that this is in [[Recognition|recognition]] of the work done by the Reeve of the Greenforest Fair, Farren Silver Streams, and Corwyn Heartsbane in securing the wayleave required to make this building possible.
