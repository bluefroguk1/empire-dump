__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Knight of the Greenwood]] is an [[Imperial Title]] aWarded to a citizen of [[Dawn]]. The Greenwood Manor was Commissioned by Bertrand of Dawn as [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] during the Summer Solstice 384YE, with work being completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 384YE.
## Responsibilities
The Knight of the Greenwood is responsible for organising Dawnish knights to quest against The [[The Vallorn]] and support actions to cleanse its taint from [[The Empire]]; they are expected to support the creation of Knightly orders dedicated to this task.
## Powers
### Treasures from the Quest
The [[Sinecure]] provides six measures of natural [[Materials]], and nine drams of herbs each season claimed from questing against the [[Vallorn]] or given as gifts by those resting at Greenwood Manor.
SuitabilityThe Knight of the Greenwood is intended to be held by a noble: the task of organising knights against The the vallorn is unsuitable for a yeofolk. If the title is held by a character who is a yeofolk, or they somehow become one during their tenure, then the player must email admin@profounddecisions.co.uk to let us know.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox. The Knight of the Greenwood is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the Dawnish [[Assembly]]. 
The title can be held by any Dawnish citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Dawn National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
