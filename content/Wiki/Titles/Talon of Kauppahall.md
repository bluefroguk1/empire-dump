## Overview
The motion to [[Construct Kauppahall|construct Kauppahall]] was raised by ''Hengest Dun'', [[Senator]] for [[Hahnmark]], during the [[Winter]] Solstice 383YE, taking advantage of an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] presented that season. Construction was completed shortly before the [[Spring]] Equinox 384YE but election of the title was stalled due to issues raised by the Constitutional Court. The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to amend the position and the first [[Talon of Kauppahall]] was elected at the same summit.
