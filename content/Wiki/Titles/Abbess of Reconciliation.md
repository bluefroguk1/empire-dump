## Overview
The [[Abbess of Reconciliation]] was created when the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to construct the Abbey of Reconciliation during the Summer Solstice 385YE. Construction was completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 385YE. The Abbey forms part of the Proffered Hand Network.
## Responsibilities
The Abbess of Reconciliation is responsible for supporting ex-slaves and refugees; bringing them into [[The Way]]; and providing them with opportunities to work and recover in [[The Empire]]. If the Abbey were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Abbess to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular Opportunity were to arise related to the Abbey, the Abbess would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
## Powers
### Bounty of Herbs
The Abbess of Reconciliation receives an income of 6 drams of true vervain, 4 drams each of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]] and [[Imperial Roseweald]], and 2 drams each of [[Bladeroot]] and [[Marrowort]] each season from the Abbey.
## [[Appointment]]
The Abbess of Reconciliation is a Highborn Appointment made by a [[Judgement]] of the [[Highguard]] National [[Assembly]]. This is a national title and can only be held by a Highborn citizen.
As with most Sinecures, this appointment has Tenure. The assumption is that the Abbess retains the position until they die or step down. They can be revoked by a lesser majority of the [[General]] Assembly, the Assembly of the Nine, or by the Highborn National Assembly.
