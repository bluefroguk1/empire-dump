## Overview
The [[Damatian Cliffs]] are located near Damata in the [[Freeborn]] [[Territory]] of [[Kahraman]]. Custodianship of the [[Damatian Cliffs]] grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[White granite|white granite]].
## The [[Resource]]
The mountains of northern [[Kahraman]] are rich in stone and ore, and site of the richest [[White granite|white granite]] quarry in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Damatian granite is easy for an expert to spot, because it is usually flecked with faint silver marks. These impurities are purely cosmetic and do not lessen its value, but a skilled stonemason who can extenuate them and work them into a structure can create breathtakingly beautiful buildings and statues. 
Almost every significant Imperial [[Fortification]] has foundations of Damatian granite, and it has been a point of [[Pride|pride]] for Seats down the ages to ensure that new fortresses and castles from [[Wintermark]] to [[Urizen]] use at least a little of their stone. It is traditional for those who have worked the cliffs here to be dismissive of the longevity of any major structure that does not use Damatian granite. Perhaps the best known [[Fortification|fortification]] built with Damatian granite was Fort Braydon (prior to its destruction in 385YE), built in the earliest days of [[The Brass Coast]] with the first granite quarried in Serra Damata. There are also three smaller castles built into the sides of the mountains overlooking the great quarries, each garrisoned by Freeborn soldiers.
There are several armed camps, small-scale [[Fortifications|fortifications]], along the mountains above the Cliffs that protect both the quarries and the rest of Kahraman from the bandits and outlaws who dwell in the hills and mountains along the borders with [[Mournwold]] and [[Liathaven]]. There are five fortresses in the region in all, each built of granite quarried nearby. The five garrisons are named for distinctive patterns of silvery inflection on their walls, which are said to take the form of one of the [[Constellations|constellations]]. They are, from east to west, [[The Key|the Key]], [[The Oak]], [[The Chain]], [[The Mountain]], and [[The Web|the Web]].
Inacia i Correrro i [[Riqueza]] was the [[Architect|architect]] who designed four of the five small castles (the Fort of the Key was built a hundred years after the other four as the quarries were expanded). She was paid a small fortune by the [[Dhomiro|dhomiro]] of Kahraman for her work, but died shortly after the last castle (the Fort of the Web) was completed. She died without other [[Family|family]], and her fortune was never accounted for. Inacia also drew many of the designs for Fort Braydon, and for several other structures both in Kahraman and beyond, and in addition to silver was regularly paid with small amounts of [[Ilium]], which she wore as jewelry on her fingers and in her hair. Always eccentric, rumours quickly surfaced after her death that she had concealed the bulk of her fortune somewhere in the mountains near the Damatian Cliffs, and barely a year goes by without someone claiming to have [[Insight|insight]] into the likely location of ''Inacia's Trove''. Such treasure seekers are figures of regular mockery to the hard-working quarry workers, of course. 
The funding of guards in Kahraman has ensured that despite problems with raiders, the custodian continues to receive 27 wains of white granite every season.
## [[The Bourse]] Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of white granite which is theirs to do with as they [[Will|will]]. If the Damatian Cliffs were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Damatian Cliffs, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the [[Bourse]]
Custodianship of the Damatian Cliffs comes with a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of white granite
The Seat has control of a source of white granite and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 27 Imperial wains of white granite every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all white granite Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the [[Summer]] Solstice. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title.
Custodianship of the Damatian Cliffs is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
