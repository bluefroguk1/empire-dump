## Overview
[[Watcher of the Wheel]] is an [[Imperial Title]] announced by the [[Arcane Architect]] in [[Autumn]] 382YE. Unlike many similar sinecures, the Keeper receives not a bounty of crystal mana, but an amount of [[Vis]].
## Responsibilities
The Watcher has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Vis]]. If the Tower were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Watcher to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Vis
The [[Watcher of the Wheel]] gains custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. They receive an income of one portion each of warm ashes, vital honey, crystal fire, and heart's blood each season.
==[[Appointment]]== 
As with all titles created by the Arcane [[Architect]], the [[Appointment|appointment]], replacement, or removal of the Watcher is made by the [[Declaration|declaration]] of [[Candidacy|candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. Any Imperial citizen may hold the title.
The Watcher of the Wheel serves until they are replaced by another [[Magician|magician]] using the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. As a title in [[The Conclave|the Conclave]], they cannot be revoked.
## Tower of the Watcher
In the northern woodlands of Madeiras, in [[Tassato]], there is a tower overgrown with ivy. A solitary [[Weirwood|weirwood]] tree grows inside it, reaching up to the heavens, its branches protruding through the walls. According to some old tales, it was once owned by a [[Troupe|troupe]] of enigmatic dramaturgists who engaged in dubious rites to win the approval of one or more of the [[Night]] eternals. 
The late Richard of [[Holberg]] designed amendments to the structure that harness the powerful flows of mana through the area.
