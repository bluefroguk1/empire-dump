## Overview
Each of the seven cardinals of virtue appoints a single [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]]. Although there is no formal relationship between the [[Cardinal]] and their [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]], they often work closely together sharing the burdens of providing leadership to those who follow their Virtue. They are generally referred to as "[[Gatekeeper]] of (Virtue)".
The gatekeepers have no formal [[Assembly]] - but there is often an unofficial council of gatekeepers where they meet to discuss matters of faith and decide on the allocation of [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s bounty of True [[Liao]].
## Responsibilities
The gatekeepers are responsible for determining who receives the precious, and limited supply of [[True liao|true liao]]. They are expected to choose someone of obvious virtue to receive each dose. Normally, a dose of true [[Liao|liao]] is used to experience a [[Past life vision|past life vision]], but there are several other uses to which it can be put. Regardless of the wishes of the gatekeepers, [[The Law|the law]] is crystal clear. The gift of true [[Liao|liao]] is a reward from [[The Synod|the Synod]] for virtuous behaviour, and the recipient is free to put it to any legal use they wish.
In practice, each [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]] tends to take their own approach to the title. Some act as an unofficial [[Proxy|proxy]] to the [[Cardinal|cardinal]] who appointed them, working in their interests to support the faith. But sometimes they take the opposite approach. When a [[Virtue assembly|virtue assembly]] is split politically or over doctrine, the [[Cardinal|cardinal]] may agree to appoint someone with opposing views as [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]]. Some restrict their role to seeking out suitable candidates for true [[Liao|liao]] - but during the time of [[Emperor Ahraz]] for example, the gatekeepers operated as an unofficial body overseeing [[Inquisition]] and [[Condemnation]], organizing other priests to root out perceived corruption in [[The Senate|the Senate]] and [[Military Council]].
First deserve it, then desire it.
## Powers
### Keepers of True [[Liao]]
The gatekeepers are responsible for determining how true liao [[Will|will]] be distributed. The legal requirement for a decision is for a majority of the gatekeepers (four) to inform the civil service of the single decision on who [[Will|will]] receive each of the available doses of true liao. By custom, the gatekeepers often seek a unanimous decision but this is not required -  the names of four gatekeepers appended to a written document detailing who [[Will|will]] receive each dose is sufficient. Once the decision is made, it cannot be changed; a ruling instituted during the reign of [[Empress Brannan]] following several high-profile murders.
By longstanding tradition, the gatekeepers meet as a group to discuss candidates, but there is no formal meeting organised by the Civil Service. Though they are rare, there have been periods of [[Imperial history]] when the gatekeepers have been unable to agree a single candidate.  
Usually, the gatekeepers [[Will|will]] meet informally to agree their choices, acting as a defacto body similar to the [[Senate]] or [[The Conclave|the Conclave]]. This reflects the intent of the laws passed at the time and scholars have noted the similarity with a [[Greater majority|greater majority]] in the [[Synod]]. But no council has ever been formally established by [[Senate motion]], and attempts to pass [[Senate Motions|Senate motions]] that share a power between other title holders, outside of one of the five great houses of [[The Empire|the Empire]], have always been ruled unconstitutional. Many modern constitutional scholars question whether the titles would pass [[Scrutiny]] today. The complex constitutional challenges posed by the existence of the gatekeepers has thwarted all attempts to put the allocation of liao on a more secure legal basis.
## [[Appointment]]
Each gatekeeper is appointed by the appropriate [[Cardinal]]. A gatekeeper must be a member of the virtue [[Assembly]] they represent. Unlike many titles, if a new [[Cardinal|cardinal]] is appointed they may immediately reappoint the appropriate gatekeeper.
It is heavily frowned upon to name a gatekeeper from the same nation as the cardinal. This custom dates back to the creation of the gatekeepers. Any cardinal who breaks the tradition risks the suspicion of their colleagues and the censure of their fellow priests. It can be difficult for such a gatekeeper to gain the respect of their peers, especially if they are a member of the same household as their cardinal.
The cardinal of a Virtue [[Assembly]] - excluding the [[Assembly]] of [[The Way]] - has the right to appoint a member of their [[Assembly|assembly]] as gatekeeper. 
Every time a new cardinal is elected the cardinal may choose to replace or retain the existing gatekeeper.
A gatekeeper serves until they die, step down, or a new cardinal is elected and chooses a new appointee. It is important to note that once appointed the cardinal cannot choose to simply remove their appointed gatekeeper from office. Only a successful re-election or [[Revocation|revocation]] allows a cardinal to appoint a new Gatekeeper.
A gatekeeper can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, and by the appropriate Virtue Assembly.
The [[History]] of the Gatekeepers
In the early days of [[The Empire|the Empire]], the allocation of true liao was controlled by use of the [[Judgement|judgement]] of [[Rewarding]]. Unfortunately, the rarity of true liao led to increasing conflict within the Synod as priests squabbled over the precious material. The disposition of true liao became such an important political issue it started to dominate the Synod, leaving them less focused on their role as spiritual advisers to [[The Empire|the Empire]]. This state of affairs continued to deteriorate until 72YE, when [[Empress Teleri]] - as part of her overhaul of the Synod - worked with the [[Imperial Senate]] to address the issue. 
The cardinals proposed to move control of true liao to the Assembly of Nine, but [[Empress Teleri]] resisted passionately. She saw no advantage in allowing the often deeply political cardinals to directly control access to true liao - she wanted the decision about who would have access to the substance to be spiritually, rather than politically motivated. In the end a compromise was reached  and a separate title of gatekeeper was created. One gatekeeper was appointed by each cardinal and they would decide the disposition of the liao together. Teleri attempted to make it a legal requirement that the gatekeeper could not be from the same nation as their cardinal, but the Constitutional Court ruled this to be unconstitutional, much to her chagrin. [[Empress Teleri]] was able to make her requirements known - but was unable to legally enforce them.
The prominence of the gatekeepers has waxed and waned. During times where the Synod is especially active, the gatekeepers often work closely with the cardinals, almost like additional proxies. While they have no specific legal powers in this area (beyond those available to every [[Member of the Synod|member of the Synod]]), they are often called on to represent their virtue assembly when the cardinal, or their [[Proxy|proxy]], is busy with other matters. There have been repeated incidents where corrupt, weak, or unpopular cardinals have been displaced by their own gatekeepers - this is seen as evidence that the system works, that the gatekeepers also keep a close watch on the cardinals for signs that they have abandoned spirituality in pursuit of political power.
