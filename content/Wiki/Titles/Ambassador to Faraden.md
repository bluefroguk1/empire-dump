## Overview
The [[Ambassador to Faraden]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The agreement to construct an official [[Embassy]] was contingent on the liberation of [[Segura]], and the repair of the Towers of Anduz. Without these two achievements, [[The Empire]] had no ability to protect trade routes (and avenues for diplomatic envoys) through the northern Lasambrian Hills. Construction of a [[Faraden]] embassy in Anduz was Commissioned by the Senate in Winter 378YE and completed shortly after the Summer Solstice 379YE.
Shortly before the Winter Solstice 382YE, Anduz was conquered by the Lasambrian [[Jotun]], and the embassy was in their hands until Anduz was retaken shortly before Spring Equinox 384YE. During that time, the [[Ambassador]] was unable to enjoy their access to Faraden merchants. With all of Segura under Imperial control, things have returned to normal.

## Powers
### Imperial Ambassador to Faraden
The title has all the common powers of an ambassador: they receive a briefing, can receive a formal delegation, and may prepare a treaty.
### Faraden Merchants
The Embassy in Segura means that the ambassador enjoys the benefits of mercantile support from traders keen to curry their favour. As a [[Ministry]], this allows them to purchase quantities of special [[Materials]] at a set price. The Ambassador spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
The production of the ministry is related to the operation the Towers of Anduz in Segura.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions]] on trade with Faraden in Winter 382YE the [[Cost]] to benefit from the Ministry increased by roughly a fifth. During the Autumn Equinox 384YE the Imperial Senate ratified a treaty with the Faraden that saw the Faraden returned to a mercantilist trading standards.
