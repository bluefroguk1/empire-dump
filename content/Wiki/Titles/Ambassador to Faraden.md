## Overview
The [[Ambassador to Faraden]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The agreement to construct an official [[Embassy]] was contingent on the liberation of [[Segura]], and the repair of the Towers of Anduz. Without these two achievements, [[The Empire|the Empire]] had no ability to protect trade routes (and avenues for diplomatic envoys) through the northern Lasambrian Hills. Construction of a [[Faraden]] [[Embassy|embassy]] in Anduz was commissioned by [[The Senate|the Senate]] in [[Winter]] 378YE and completed shortly after the [[Summer]] Solstice 379YE.
Shortly before the Winter Solstice 382YE, Anduz was conquered by the Lasambrian [[Jotun]], and the [[Embassy|embassy]] was in their hands until Anduz was retaken shortly before [[Spring]] Equinox 384YE. During that time, the [[Ambassador|ambassador]] was unable to enjoy their access to [[Faraden]] merchants. With all of [[Segura]] under Imperial control, things have returned to normal.
