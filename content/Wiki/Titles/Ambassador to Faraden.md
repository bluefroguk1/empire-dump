## Overview
The [[Ambassador to Faraden]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The agreement to construct an official [[Embassy]] was contingent on the liberation of [[Segura]], and the repair of the [[Segura#The Towers of Anduz|Towers of Anduz]]. Without these two achievements, the Empire had no ability to protect trade routes (and avenues for diplomatic envoys) through the northern Lasambrian Hills. Construction of a Faraden embassy in [[Segura#Anduz|Anduz]] was [[Construct Faraden embassy|commissioned]] by the Senate in Winter 378YE and completed shortly after the Summer Solstice 379YE.
Shortly before the Winter Solstice 382YE, Anduz was conquered by the Lasambrian Jotun, and the embassy was in their hands until Anduz was retaken shortly before Spring Equinox 384YE. During that time, the [[Ambassador|ambassador]] was unable to enjoy their [[Ambassador to Faraden#Faraden Merchants|access to Faraden merchants]]. With all of Segura under Imperial control, things have returned to normal.
