No. Call it the [[Conscience of the Senate]]. If I ever have need of a conscience... I'll find my own priest.
## Overview
The [[Conscience of the Senate]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] appointed by the  [[Appointment#Appointment of the Cardinal| Cardinal]] of the [[The Assemblies of the Synod#The Virtue Assemblies|Assembly of the Way]] in the [[Imperial Synod]]. It is considered a virtue title of the Assembly of the Way. 
During the reign of [[Empress Teleri]], all the cardinals of the Synod were granted the abilities now wielded by the Conscience. They used them in a variety of ways, and to the increasing chagrin of the [[Imperial Senate]]. When [[Empress Varkula]] came to the [[The Throne|Throne]], she orchestrated matters so that the Senate was able to successfully remove those powers from the cardinals. As a compromise, however, the post of the Conscience was created and its appointment left in the hands of the [[Cardinal of the Way]]. The intention is that rather than representing the interests of any one Virtue assembly it will instead represent all the virtuous citizens of the Empire.
## Responsibilities
The Conscience is intended to observe Senate affairs; to speak on behalf of the virtuous; to keep the [[Senator|senators]] focused on their duty to the citizens of the Empire rather than their own aggrandizement; and to represent the Synod in the Senate when needed. When the Synod passes a judgement of [[Veto]], it is the responsibility of the Conscience to ensure that someone presents that decision in the next Senate meeting. Often the Conscience will do so themselves, but they may appoint someone else to do so.
## Limitations
### One Year Only
The Conscience serves for up to one year, unless removed from office early. In addition, no person may hold the seat of the Conscience more than once in their lifetime. This restriction is [[#history|historical]] in nature, put in place when the post was first created to limit the power of the Conscience.
### Lay Person
The Conscience must be a lay-person; this means that if the appointee has a [[Congregation]], they must give up their membership of their assembly and lose the ability to participate in the business of the [[Imperial Synod]] for as long as they serve.
### Proxy
As with many Imperial titles, the [[Conscience of the Senate]] may appoint a [[Proxy]] following the normal rules. The proxy must be legally eligible to hold the title so they may not preside over a [[Congregation]], and must never have held the title of Conscience of the Senate previously. However being the proxy for the Conscience of the Senate does not then prevent someone from holding the full title at a later date.
## Powers
The Conscience enjoys many of the same powers as a [[Senator]] with the advantage that they do not need to worry about re-election. Some Consciences decline to use these powers, seeing their role as more ceremonial; others take full part in the business of the Senate, engaging in spirited debates with their fellow senators.
### Member of the Senate
The Conscience is a [[Senate session#Member of the Senate|member of the Senate]]. They are entitled to enter the Senate chamber at the start of a [[Senate session]] and participate in the debates.
### Representation
The Conscience may cast vote on any [[Senate motion#Majority Vote|majority motion]] that is brought before the Senate. They may not vote on a motion that requires a constitutional vote.
### Proposal
The Conscience may [[Senate motion#Proposal|propose]] a single motion for consideration by the Senate each summit.
### Voice of Virtue
The Conscience may [[Senator#Abstention|abstain]] from any vote in the Senate. The conscience will often be called on to speak on matters relating to the Synod.
## Appointment
The [[Cardinal]] of the Way may appoint any citizen to be the Conscience, provided that that citizen has never held the position previously. It is frowned upon to name a conscience from the same nation as the [[Cardinal|cardinal]]. If the Conscience controls a congregation, they face [[#Lay person|additional restrictions]].
The conscience may hold the seat for no longer than a year, or until a new [[Cardinal of the Way|cardinal of the Way]] is appointed and chooses to name a replacement. For example, if a Conscience were appointed during the Winter Solstice, they would serve until the end of the Winter Solstice the following year, or until a new [[Cardinal|cardinal]] was appointed who wanted to replace them.
They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Assembly of the Way]], and the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
