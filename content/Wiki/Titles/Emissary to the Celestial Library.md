## Overview
The [[Emissary to the Celestial Library]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created in Summer 383YE by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The [[Senate motion|motion]] to [[Create Title of Emissary to the Celestial Library|create the title]] was based on a proposal by the [[Eternal]] [[Phaleron]] - a refinement of an arrangement it had [[The way that the sunshine gleams#A Chosen Emissary|first offered]] to the [[Imperial Conclave]] in Autumn 382YE.
## Responsibilities
The Emissary is responsible for assisting the scholars and librarians of [[Urizen]] and the Empire, aiding them in the responsible spread of knowledge, supporting libraries and places of learning. They are also expected to intercede between such people and the Celestial Library itself. In return the title holder receives regalia created by Phaleron.
## Powers
### The Key of Knowledge
The celestial library provides the Emissary with an item called the ''Key of Knowledge'' at the rate of one each year. This item is the legal property of the Emissary of the Celestial Library, and if the citizen holding the title changes during the year the previous holder should ensure the Key is transferred to the new title holder as soon as possible. The key is a [[Magic items#Talismans|talisman]] that allows a magician bonded to it to employ ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]] in place of crystal mana when performing either [[Skein of Years]] or [[Gift of Knowledge]]. Unlike similar items, each ingot of weltsilver will count as a single crystal of mana in the hands of the bearer, and the holder of the focus does not need to have mastered either ritual to employ this ability.
### Librarian's Scroll
Each season the Emissary is given a single scroll which may be used in conjunction with the [[Operate Portal]] spell to request information from the Celestial Library. The emissary must indicate a single topic they desire information about, use the operate portal spell at a suitable [[Regio]] aligned with the Day realm (or the [[Regio#Imperial Regio|Imperial regio at Anvil]]), and then during the following summit the emissary will receive an except from one of the verified sources contained within Phaleron relating to that topic. It will be a few paragraphs at most, but it will relate as closely to the matter requested as possible.
## Appointment
The [[Emissary to the Celestial Library]] is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. They are elected by vote of the [[Magical skills#Magician|magicians]] of [[Urizen]]. They serve for a year, or until they die, step down, or are revoked.
The title can only be held by an Urizen citizen. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the Urizen [[National Assembly]], the [[Assembly#General Assembly|general assembly]], or the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
Dealing with Phaleron
The Celestial Library agrees to honour the obligation to provide both the focus and the scroll of knowledge for as long as the Imperial Conclave does not declare enmity with it, and as long as Urizen does not abandon its commitment to the responsible spread of knowledge. While the eternal cannot abrogate the title - it was created by the Imperial senate - they can choose to remove their support from the position or even from a specific holder of the title.
