## Overview
The [[Emissary to the Celestial Library]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created in [[Summer]] 383YE by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The motion to create the title was based on a proposal by the [[Eternal]] [[Phaleron]] - a refinement of an arrangement it had first offered to the [[Imperial Conclave]] in [[Autumn]] 382YE.
## Responsibilities
The Emissary is responsible for assisting the scholars and librarians of [[Urizen]] and [[The Empire|the Empire]], aiding them in the responsible spread of knowledge, supporting libraries and places of learning. They are also expected to intercede between such people and [[The Celestial Library|the Celestial Library]] itself. In return the title holder receives regalia created by [[Phaleron]].
## Powers
### [[The Key]] of Knowledge
[[The Celestial Library|The celestial library]] provides the Emissary with an item called the ''Key of Knowledge'' at the rate of one each year. This item is the legal property of the Emissary of [[The Celestial Library|the Celestial Library]], and if the citizen holding the title changes during the year the previous holder should ensure the Key is transferred to the new title holder as soon as possible. The key is a talisman that allows a [[Magician|magician]] bonded to it to employ ingots of [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]] in place of crystal mana when performing either [[Skein of Years]] or [[Gift of Knowledge]]. Unlike similar items, each ingot of weltsilver [[Will|will]] count as a single crystal of mana in the hands of the bearer, and the holder of the focus does not need to have mastered either [[Ritual|ritual]] to employ this ability.
### Librarian's Scroll
Each season the Emissary is given a single scroll which may be used in conjunction with the [[Operate Portal]] spell to request information from [[The Celestial Library|the Celestial Library]]. The emissary must indicate a single topic they desire information about, use the [[Operate Portal|operate portal]] spell at a suitable [[Regio]] aligned with the [[Day]] [[Realm|realm]] (or the Imperial [[Regio|regio]] at [[Anvil]]), and then during the following summit the emissary [[Will|will]] receive an except from one of the verified sources contained within [[Phaleron]] relating to that topic. It [[Will|will]] be a few paragraphs at most, but it [[Will|will]] relate as closely to the matter requested as possible.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Emissary to the Celestial Library]] is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. They are elected by vote of the magicians of [[Urizen]]. They serve for a year, or until they die, step down, or are revoked.
The title can only be held by an [[Urizen]] citizen. They can be revoked by the [[Urizen]] National [[Assembly]], the [[General|general]] [[Assembly|assembly]], or the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
Dealing with [[Phaleron]]
[[The Celestial Library]] agrees to honour the obligation to provide both the focus and the scroll of knowledge for as long as the [[Imperial Conclave]] does not declare enmity with it, and as long as [[Urizen]] does not abandon its commitment to the responsible spread of knowledge. While the [[Eternal|eternal]] cannot abrogate the title - it was created by the [[Imperial Senate|Imperial senate]] - they can choose to remove their support from the position or even from a specific holder of the title.
