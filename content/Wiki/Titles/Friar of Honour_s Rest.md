## Honour's Rest
The church of Honour's Rest stands atop a low hill near Overton on the Greensward. Built mostly in the Marcher style, there are a few clear Wintermark touches including a series of stone Winterfolk warriors that seem to watch over pilgrims and resident priests alike from the white-stone walls of the church. 
From the hill, it is only a short walk to the ruins, and pilgrims rest here on their way to visit the great barrow mounds raised by the [[Jotun]] in the wake of the fall of Orchard's Watch. Occasionally, the friars who live and work here are called on to address problems with angry or mournful ghosts that haunt the ruins, but for the most part Honour's Rest is an oasis of quiet, calm, and sorrow.
