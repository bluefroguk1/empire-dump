## Overview
The [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that may be held by any [[Navarr]]. The position was established by majority vote of [[The Senate|the Senate]] in [[Spring]] 378YE. Prior to the Spring Equinox 384YE the Advisor had the power to [[Commission|commission]] [[Historical research]]. That power was removed following changes to how the Department was organised.
The Advisor of [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] has been the target of several attacks by agents of the [[Whisper Gallery]]. These eternals appear to object to the Advisor's role in directing [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s [[Historical research]] agenda. It remains to be seen whether the removal of the power of [[Historical research|historical research]] [[Will|will]] change the attitude of the sinister eternals.
## Responsibilities
The title is responsible for advising the [[Senate]] on matters relating to the [[Vallorn]], and protecting [[The Empire|the Empire]] from the influence of this mysterious force or entity. As custodian of the Great Library of Hacynian,  if the [[Commission|commission]] were to be threatened in any way, it would be their responsibility of the Advisor to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any [[Opportunity]] relating to [[The Library|the library]] presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of that.
## Powers
### Right of Address
The [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] has the right to make an address to the Senate once per summit. This is intended to allow them to present important information for the Senators consideration. It is extremely impolite not to inform the Speaker's seat of your intention to use the Right of Address in advance of a session.
### Custodian of the Great Library
The Advisor has custodianship of the Great Library of Hacynian in [[Hercynia]]. They are not automatically assumed to be involved in the [[Day|day]] to day operation of [[The Library|the library]] but are assumed to direct those efforts. The custodian cannot take any action that would require a legal power to authorize, such as abrogating or ceding the [[Commission|commission]] (which are [[Powers of the Imperial Senate|powers of the Imperial Senate]]).
## [[Appointment]]
The Advisor on [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Navarr]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a [[Navarr]] citizen. The advisor has [[Tenure|tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Navarr]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Publication
Notes presented to the [[Imperial Senate]] by Neb, a previous Advisor on the [[Vallorn]], have been [https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/File:Vallorn_Notes.pdf made available] to anyone who is interested. Nathair Autumngale has also made two reports available: one on the Heirs of the Terunael, and the other on the Terunael mineworkings.
The [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] has also commissioned a number of [[Historical research]] projects. Details of these projects can be found here.

## The Great Library of Hacynian
The Great Library of Hacynian is a [[Folly]] constructed with small amounts of [[Weirwood]], [[White granite]], and [[Mithril]], and incorporates parts of an older Terunael structure. It was built at Mourning Hollow, an old battlefield on the south-eastern borders of Summersend, in [[Hercynia]]. 
The new building has been constructed as much as possible in the style of the old ruins, incorporating their original stone wherever possible. The structure is not especially large, but it is exceptionally beautiful, filled with shelves of scrolls and parchments written by students of [[Navarr History|Navarr history]]. It also incorporates a small shrine dedicated to the virtue of [[Wisdom]]. The shrine is lit by a single lightstone held by a wooden candlestick with swirling vines carved on its surface. The candlestick is another relic of the ancient temple. Carved by Jhessail Cedny, one of the founders of the nearby [[Steading]] of Foxden, the candlestick apparently also sat in the original library before it was destroyed by the Vard. 
In the central chamber sits a large [[Weirwood|weirwood]] table, the surface engraved with intricate swirling patterns and serving as a focus for [[Blood magic]] of the vates who visit [[The Library|the library]] to study. In the middle of the table rests a battered cauldron, the ''Bowl of [[Phaleron]]'', which once served as a covenstone for the magicians who tended the original library.
### [[History]]
Mourning Hollow was for a very long time haunted by the unquiet spirits of dead Vard and [[Navarr]] warriors, apparently trapped there as the result of some forgotten [[Curse|curse]] or betrayal. Following a heroic expedition to the Hollow in [[Winter]] 379YE, there have been no further sightings of ghosts. The same expedition located the ruins of an old building, a so-called "Temple of [[Phaleron]]" dedicated to the [[Eternal]] of the same name. Built in a peculiar [[Regio]] that seemed to cycle [[Alignment|alignment]] between Day and [[Night]] [[Realms|realms]], there was evidence that the temple was once a large library built by the Terunael people of the city of Hacynian (from which the entire [[Territory|territory]] takes its name).
In Spring 381YE the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to restore [[The Library|the library]] there. Work on the new structure was quickly completed, shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice 381YE, and the first librarians and archaeologists arrived within the week. Not much is known about the history of the original structure, although the interest of [[Phaleron]] is obvious. There is some evidence that at least one other [[Eternal|eternal]], perhaps [[Sung]] or the [[Whisper Gallery]] have an interest in the area as well. The eternals' influence presumably cycles along with the peculiar [[Regio|regio]].
### Terunael Lorekeeper
There was briefly an [[Imperial Title]] - Terunael Lorekeeper - created to oversee [[The Library|the library]] but that role was effectively abrogated when the Senate passed a motion to amend the powers of the Advisor on [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] granting them custodianship of the library. The Lorekeeper was expected to take on a specific oath: "''I [[Will|will]] protect the Library for as long as I can''." The oath was apparently that sworn by a pre-Imperial Navarri [[Vate|vate]] whose spirit was kept captive in Mourning Hollow by the grim [[Magic|magic]] of a [[Volodny]]. The tormented spirit was freed in 379YE when this oath was taken up by the heroic explorers visiting Mourning Hollow to deal with the dark curses found there.
