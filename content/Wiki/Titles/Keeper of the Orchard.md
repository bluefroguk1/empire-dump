## Good Walder's Orchard
In the [[Mitwold#Golden Downs|Golden Downs]], just south of the town of [[Mitwold#Hay|Hay]] in Mitwold, near the Mourn border, there's an old stand of trees, mostly apples. There's been a local legend, an old story, an old [[The Marches magical traditions#Mummers|mummers']] tale, that maybe the biggest and oldest apple tree of the lot of them marks the grave of Good Walder. Certainly the local [[The Marches religious beliefs#Monks and Friars|friars]], have always claimed it was though to be fair dozens of villages across the Marches have a stand of trees that allegedly marks the grave of the paragon.
But there is something unusual about this copse. The old tree at the heart of the copse has never given many apples, but the ones that do ripen are said to taste like none other. Good hearty Marcher apples, the best you ever did taste, for all that they're so few in number. In the summer of 382YE, there were reports of an unexpectedly big harvest from the old tree - that it literally groaned with fruit, and so did its neighbours. Inevitably - with all the rumours of Good Walder flying about at the time - local folk began calling it a miracle. The friars of Hay made representation to the nation at the following  Autumn summit, claiming that if the strange harvest was a miracle then it was a miracle of Prosperity. They presented several proposals as to how best to honour that miracle.
In the end the [[Imperial Senate]] chose to build a shrine dedicated to Good Walder at the orchard, The shrine offers support and hospitality to pilgrims visiting the orchard and ensures that the ''Keeper of Good Walder's Grave'' receives the benefits of a site of pilgrimage ''in addition to any apples that blossomed.''
