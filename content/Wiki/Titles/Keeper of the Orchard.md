## Overview
The [[Imperial Senate]] Commissioned the  construction of [[Good Walder]]'s Orchard during the Autumn Equinox 383YE. Built near Walder's Oak in the Golden Downs, [[Mitwold]], work was completed shortly before the Winter Solstice 383YE. Local stories suggest that Good Walder himself is buried beneath the largest and oldest apple tree in the orchard, but there is no actual evidence to support this claim.
## Responsibilities
The [[Keeper of the Orchard]] has no particular responsibilities; they are recognised as having votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] and they receive a bounty of [[Liao]] from the civil service. If the orchard were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Keeper to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The [[Sinecure]] provides eleven measures of Liao to the Keeper each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in the Synod
__TOC__
The Keeper of the Orchard may sit in the Imperial Synod, and possesses 22 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 22 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any [[Assembly]] for which they are eligible. 
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice. The Keeper of the Orchard is appointed by a [[Judgement]] of Appointment in the Marcher National national assembly.  
The title can be held by any Marcher citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Marcher National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## Good Walder's Orchard
In the Golden Downs, just south of the town of Hay in Mitwold, near the Mourn border, there's an old stand of trees, mostly apples. There's been a local legend, an old story, an old mummers' tale, that maybe the biggest and oldest apple tree of the lot of them marks the grave of Good Walder. Certainly the local friars, have always claimed it was though to be fair dozens of villages across [[The Marches]] have a stand of trees that allegedly marks the grave of the paragon.
But there is something unusual about this copse. The old tree at the heart of the copse has never given many apples, but the ones that do ripen are said to taste like none other. Good hearty Marcher apples, the best you ever did taste, for all that they're so few in number. In the summer of 382YE, there were reports of an unexpectedly big harvest from the old tree - that it literally groaned with fruit, and so did its neighbours. Inevitably - with all the rumours of Good Walder flying about at the time - local folk began calling it a miracle. The friars of Hay made representation to the nation at the following  Autumn summit, claiming that if the [[Strange harvest]] was a miracle then it was a miracle of [[Prosperity]]. They presented several proposals as to how best to honour that miracle.
In the end the Imperial Senate chose to build a shrine dedicated to Good Walder at the orchard, The shrine offers support and hospitality to pilgrims Visiting the orchard and ensures that the ''Keeper of Good Walder's Grave'' receives the benefits of a site of PilgriPilgrimage ''in addition to any apples that blossomed.''
