## Overview
The [[Keeper of the Memorial Gardens of Treji]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Autumn]] 378YE. The position of keeper is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of valuable [[Herbs|herbs]]. Initially a [[Navarr]] national position, the title was amended during the [[Summer]] Solstice 382YE to transfer custody to the [[Imperial Orcs]].
## Responsibilities
The Keeper oversees the gardens that memorialize the [[Navarr]] and Imperial Orc [[Heroes|heroes]] who died to retake Treji from the [[Thule]].
## Powers
### Gardener's Bounty
The Keeper of the Memorial Gardens of Teji gains custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. They receive 6 [[Bladeroot]], 6 [[True Vervain]], 2 [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], 2 [[Imperial Roseweald]], and 2 doses of [[Marrowort]] each season.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The [[Keeper of the Memorial Gardens of Treji]] is appointed by the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[Senator]]. If the [[Senator|senator]] cannot reach a decision, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by an [[Imperial Orcs]] citizen. The Keeper has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]]. 
May we never forget the sacrifice of the [[Summer Storm]] and the Navarri who fought with them to retake Treji.
Let they find their way through the Labyrinth.
Let them find their way over the Abyss to the far shores.
May we never forget we are stronger as a united Empire,
Let those who read this have the virtue to live up to the example set by those liberators.
## The Memorial Gardens
The gardens contain a thousand flapping pieces of cloth, each piece from a fallen hero from the battle to retake Treji, both [[Navarr]] and [[Summer Storm]] alike. Beneath each flag is a small [[Herb garden|herb garden]] of [[Bladeroot]] and scented flowers. The [[Bladeroot]] represents the early deaths of those who fought and the scented flowers chosen to remind those that smell them of summer. At the centre of [[The Garden|the garden]] stands a monument to the fallen crafted from [[Weirwood|weirwood]] and [[Enchanted|enchanted]] ice. Atop the monument is a statue of a [[Navarr]] warrior sanding back to back with an Imperial orc from the [[Summer Storm]] legion, their bodies covered like tattoos with the names of the dead. Beneath it rests a plaque, memorializing the fallen.
When the gardens were first created, they were placed in the custody of the [[Navarr]]. During the Summer Solstice 382YE, however, custodianship was transferred to the [[Imperial Orcs]]. The Constitutional Court ruled that as the title had tenure, the keeper at the time the amendment was made - Ceinwen [[Eternal]] of the [[Eternal]] [[Family]] - would retain custody until they died, stepped down, or were revoked. After this, the title would be appointed by the [[Imperial Orcs]].
