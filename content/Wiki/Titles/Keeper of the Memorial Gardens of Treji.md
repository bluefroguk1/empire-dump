May we never forget we are stronger as a united Empire,
Let those who read this have the virtue to live up to the example set by those liberators.
## The Memorial Gardens
The gardens contain a thousand flapping pieces of cloth, each piece from a fallen hero from the battle to retake Treji, both Navarr and Summer Storm alike. Beneath each flag is a small herb garden of Bladeroot and scented flowers. The Bladeroot represents the early deaths of those who fought and the scented flowers chosen to remind those that smell them of summer. At the centre of the garden stands a monument to the fallen crafted from weirwood and enchanted ice. Atop the monument is a statue of a Navarr warrior sanding back to back with an Imperial orc from the Summer Storm legion, their bodies covered like tattoos with the names of the dead. Beneath it rests a plaque, memorializing the fallen.
When the gardens were first created, they were placed in the custody of the Navarr. During the Summer Solstice 382YE, however, custodianship was [[Amend Memorial Gardens of Treji|transferred]] to the [[Imperial Orcs]]. The [[Scrutiny#Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] ruled that as the title had tenure, the keeper at the time the amendment was made - Ceinwen Eternal of the [[Navarr groups#The Eternal Family|Eternal Family]] - would retain custody until they died, stepped down, or were revoked. After this, the title would be appointed by the Imperial Orcs.
