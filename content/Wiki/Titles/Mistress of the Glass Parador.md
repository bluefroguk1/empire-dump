## Overview
The Mistress (or Master) of the Glass Parador is an [[Imperial Title]]  awarded to a [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] citizen. It is a national position appointed through the [[Imperial Bourse|Bourse]].
The [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]] was initially created to help preserve the integrity and reputation of the merchants of the Brass Coast. The title grants the use of beautiful offices in [[Madruga#Siroc|Siroc]], and coincidentally offers endless opportunities to acquire valuable goods for personal use or profitable resale. [[Corsair|Corsairs]] and merchants who are looking to sell their goods quickly will often approach the [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]] or one of her agents, and she is regularly consulted by the citizens of Siroc on minor matters related to good conduct and business. 
The luxurious Glass Parador itself is centrally located, and constructed of beautiful white marble columns, gorgeous stained glass windows and delicate lanterns lit by fine quality lightstones imported from [[Urizen]]. It has a small permanent staff, and is a regular stop for merchants and travelers visiting Siroc from all over the Empire and beyond.
Prior to the [[384YE Spring Equinox winds of fortune#Sails of Fire|popular change]] prompted by the Brass Coast National Assembly, only those captains of fleets that had engaged in [[Fleet#Take Independent Action|privateering]] during the previous year could vote for the [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]]. This changed shortly before the Spring Equinox 383YE and now every captain of a [[Fleet]] in the Brass Coast has a say in who will hold the title.
## Responsibilities
The Mistress of the Glass Parador is expected to ensure that [[The Brass Coast economic interests|paradors]] and merchants operating in and around the City of a Thousand Sails are trading honestly. Many of her duties are ceremonial - she is often asked to officially launch new vessels, or to offer advice on business ventures that will travel to distant or dangerous lands. In return, Mistress receives preferential treatment from many [[The Brass Coast economic interests|corsair]] and merchant [[Fleet|fleets]] operating out of [[Madruga]], or who visit the Jewel of the Bay.
In actuality, the Mistress of the Glass Parador is no more or less likely to be a paragon of honesty than any other Freeborn merchant. Indeed, they often encounter more opportunities to receive bribes or make disreputable deals than they would if they did not possess the title. This being the Brass Coast it is expected the Mistress will take advantage of the connections offered to enrich themselves. The role offers ample opportunity to purchase luxury goods such as vibrant [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] or polished [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]].
