## Overview
The Mistress (or Master) of the Glass Parador is an [[Imperial Title]]  awarded to a [[Freeborn]] citizen. It is a national position appointed through [[The Bourse|the Bourse]].
The [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]] was initially created to help preserve the integrity and reputation of the merchants of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]]. The title grants the use of beautiful offices in Siroc, and coincidentally offers endless [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to acquire valuable goods for personal use or profitable resale. Corsairs and merchants who are looking to sell their goods quickly [[Will|will]] often approach the [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]] or one of her agents, and she is regularly consulted by the citizens of Siroc on minor matters related to good [[Conduct|conduct]] and [[Business|business]]. 
The luxurious Glass Parador itself is centrally located, and constructed of beautiful white marble columns, [[Gorgeous|gorgeous]] stained glass windows and delicate lanterns lit by fine quality lightstones imported from [[Urizen]]. It has a small permanent staff, and is a regular stop for merchants and travelers visiting Siroc from all over [[The Empire|the Empire]] and beyond.
Prior to the popular change prompted by [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] National [[Assembly]], only those captains of fleets that had engaged in privateering during the previous year could vote for the [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]]. This changed shortly before the [[Spring]] Equinox 383YE and now every captain of a [[Fleet]] in [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] has a say in who [[Will|will]] hold the title.
## Responsibilities
The [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]] is expected to ensure that paradors and merchants operating in and around the City of a Thousand Sails are trading honestly.

In return, Mistress receives preferential treatment from many [[Corsair|corsair]] and merchant fleets operating out of [[Madruga]], or who visit the Jewel of the Bay.
In actuality, the [[Mistress of the Glass Parador]] is no more or less likely to be a [[Paragon|paragon]] of [[Honesty|honesty]] than any other Freeborn merchant. Indeed, they often encounter more opportunities to receive bribes or make disreputable deals than they would if they did not possess the title. This being [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] it is expected the Mistress [[Will|will]] take advantage of the connections offered to enrich themselves. The role offers ample [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to purchase luxury goods such as vibrant [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] or polished [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]].
