## Overview
The [[High Bard of the Empire]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] appointed by the [[Assembly]] of the Nine. It was created by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the [[Winter]] Solstice 380YE summit. Following some controversy, the title was granted a stipend during the [[Summer]] Solstice of the same year.
The title as first presented passed through [[The Senate|the Senate]] during the Winter 380YE session, but there was some opposition from the Constitutional Court. While the discussion continued, Kaywenn du Launcet was appointed the first High Bard and the situation was resolved in Summer 381YE.
The title seems to court controversy; the first address by Kaywenn du Launcet took the form of a highly political song apparently lauding convicted criminal Dogri Thulebane of [[Wintermark]], and criticizing the Varushkan army of the [[Iron Helms]] who were instrumental in his capture. It remains to be seen if this [[Will|will]] create a trend for future addresses, and for future High Bards.
## Responsibilities
The High Bard is expected to leave a personal composition as a [[Legacy|legacy]]. They are expected to keep the [[Senate]] appraised of matters of inspiration to [[The Empire|the Empire]], and to promote and encourage excellence and passionate demonstration of artistic performance across all [[The Nations|the nations]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
