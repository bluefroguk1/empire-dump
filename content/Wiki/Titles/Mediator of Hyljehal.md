## Overview
The [[Mediator of Hyljehal]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a [[Wintermark]] citizen. The Mediator has custody of [[#Hyljehal|Hyljehal]], a floating wooden hall moored in the Rikkivesi, [[Construct Hyljehal|constructed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in response to [[Honey and vinegar#Floating Stones|a proposal]] by the mysterious ''hylje'' seal-people. 
## Responsibilities
The Mediator is responsible for maintaining good relations between Wintermark and the ''hylje'', as well as for protecting Hyljehal itself. Should any decisions need to be made about Hyljehal, the Mediator would be expected to make them. While there is no direct mechanism provided for speaking with the ''hylje'', and the Mediator is not an [[Ambassador]] as such, it is likely that any hylje wishing to speak to the people of Wintermark will look to the Mediator for guidance.

As well as a place of mediation, Hyljehal is a [[Ministry]]. The Mediator can purchase quantities of crystal mana from the ''hylje'' at a set price. The Mediator makes their decision how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
### Emissary to the Hylje
Following the [[In good company#Second Skin .28Conjunction.29|rescue of Koskinen]] in Summer 384YE, the ''hylje'' have realised they cannot live apart from the people of Sermersuaq. As such, they have provided the Mediator with an address where they may send a [[Call Winged Messenger]] should they have matters to discuss with the sealfolk. They are clear that they are unlikely to be interested in making regular trips to Anvil - it is a very long way and there is little there they are interested in - so any request for them to do so is likely to be denied. The ability to send a winged messenger is intended for the mediator to raise matters of mutual interest, request assistance, or let the hylje know things happening in the wider world that might effect them. At this time, the hylje are not especially interested in hearing from anyone else.
==Appointment== 
The [[Mediator of Hyljehal]] is appointed during the Summer Solstice each year by unanimous decision of the [[Senator|senators]] of [[Wintermark]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a citizen of Wintermark. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wintermark [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
The hylje insist that the mediator must be Suaq. The civil service advise that as a Wintermark national position, only a Wintermark citizen can hold the title, but that no constitutional method exists to restrict the title so that only the Suaq may stand. The Senate motion further supported the desire of the hylje by determining that the title would "be appointed by Wintermark Senators with consideration that the Hylje ask for a Suaq Mediator in good standing."
## Hyljehal
After the invasion of [[Sermersuaq]] by the [[Jotun]] in 382YE, ''[[Wintermark history|hylje]]'' were encountered in greater numbers on the banks of the Rikkivesi in [[Kallavesa]], and along the shores of the northern lakes of [[Hahnmark#Bruckland|Bruckland]] in [[Hahnmark]], than ever before. The seal-shifters have no love for the Jotun and many retreated in the face of their advance. The hylje are not a warlike people - [[Song of the lakefolk|recent misunderstandings]] between them and the Suaq aside- and they had no interest in open battle with the Jotun. Regardless, they were keen to see the Mark victorious and the [[Orc|orcs]] driven back, and while they would not fight, they were prepared to support their cousins in other ways - especially when they learned that the Empire had recognised them as a people in their own right (this apparently being their interpretation of the clause in the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|Liberty Pact]] that [[Ratify Liberty Pact#Definition of a Person|defines the nature of a person]]). They were in no doubt that it was the folk of Wintermark they had to thank for this odd honour.
As a consequence, some of the ''hylje'' approached their Winterfolk cousins about building a hall so that they could more easily come together -  but built on a platform of wood so that it will float rather than being build on the shores of the lake. The hylje planned to moor the structure on the banks of the Rikkivesi, providing a meeting ground between the Suaq and the hylje as well as the other people of the Mark, allowing them to trade. 
The hall is an impressive feat of engineering; a great raft with each wooden log marked with the runes [[Pallas]] and [[Verys]] to help it stay together and support the weight of the hall itself. Atop the raft is built a long hall, carved and decorated with motifs of water and fish. Two great birds are carved over the doors that stand at either end - a hawk and a heron - symbolising [[Loyalty]] and [[Pride]].
The hylje who visit the hall bring fish, as well as crabs and eels taken from the lake's bed, looking to trade them for iron knives and similar tools that are in short supply among their people. Often they find mana crystals, formed amid the mud and plants in the deepest parts of the lake. They have more than enough mana for their own use but are happy to sell the surplus to the mediator for a fair price - for goods and occasionally money.
