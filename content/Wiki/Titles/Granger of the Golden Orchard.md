## Overview
The Golden Orchards of [[Miaren]] was commissioned by a motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Winter]] 379YE by Caerwyn Summercrow, [[Senator]] for [[Therunin]]. Construction of the Golden Orchards of [[Miaren]] was completed shortly before the 380YE [[Autumn]] Equinox.
The position of Granger is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities
The Granger of the Golden Orchards has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of crystal mana from the Golden Orchards in [[Miaren]]. If the Golden Orchards were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Granger to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The [[Granger of the Golden Orchard]] gains custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. They receive an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Granger of the Golden Orchard]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Navarr]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a [[Navarr]] citizen. The Granger has [[Tenure|tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Navarr]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Golden Orchards of [[Miaren]]
From a distance the Serenael orchard looks home to normal apple trees, with golden fruit hanging from their branches. 
However when one draws closer, its arcane nature becomes clear. At the centre of the orchard, surrounded by beautiful apple trees, lies a single great [[Weirwood|weirwood]] tree, coiled around by massive briars and thorns. These are treacherous to climb, tearing clothes and skin in equal measure. The attendants of the Orchard receive training such that they are able to safely wend their way through the branches to pluck the mana crystals from the tree. 
The crystal mana forms where the thorns of the surrounding brambles pierce the bark of the underlying tree. The sap weeps at these points and, with the aid of appropriate techniques, solidifies and crystallises to form a piece of mana.
