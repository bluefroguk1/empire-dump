## Overview
The [[Ambassador to Axos]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]].
After several years of wrangling, an [[Embassy]] to the citadels of [[Axos]] was Commissioned by the Imperial Senate during the  Summer Solstice 380YE, and work began almost immediately in [[Urizen]]. Built in the port-town of Cargo, in [[Redoubt]], construction was completed in a timely fashion and the Axou [[Ambassador]] and their staff took residence shortly before the Autumn Equinox. With the opening of the embassy, the Axou in turn opened the port of Towers of Kantor to Imperial shipping. Closer ties between the two nations also saw a significant increase in the number of black-sailed vessels calling at Imperial ports not only on  the [[Bay of Catazar]], but also in Dawnish and Varushkan ports on [[The Semmerlak]].
