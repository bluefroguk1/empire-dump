## Overview

After several years of wrangling, an [[Embassy]] to the citadels of [[Axos]] was [[Commission|commissioned]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the  [[Construct Axos Embassy|Summer Solstice 380YE]], and work began almost immediately in [[Urizen]]. Built in the port-town of [[Redoubt#Cargo|Cargo]], in [[Redoubt]], construction was completed in a timely fashion and the Axou [[Ambassador]] and their staff took residence shortly before the Autumn Equinox. With the opening of the embassy, the Axou in turn opened the port of [[Axos ports|Towers of Kantor]] to Imperial [[Fleet|shipping]]. Closer ties between the two nations also saw a significant increase in the number of black-sailed vessels calling at Imperial ports not only on  the Bay of Catazar, but also in [[Dawn|Dawnish]] and [[Varushka|Varushkan]] ports on [[The Semmerlak]].
