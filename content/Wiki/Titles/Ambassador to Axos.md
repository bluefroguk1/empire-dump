## Overview
The [[Ambassador to Axos]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]].
After several years of wrangling, an [[Embassy]] to the citadels of [[Axos]] was commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the  [[Summer]] Solstice 380YE, and work began almost immediately in [[Urizen]]. Built in the port-town of Cargo, in [[Redoubt]], construction was completed in a timely fashion and the Axou [[Ambassador]] and their staff took residence shortly before the [[Autumn]] Equinox. With the opening of the [[Embassy|embassy]], the Axou in turn opened the port of Towers of Kantor to Imperial shipping. Closer ties between the two nations also saw a significant increase in the number of black-sailed vessels calling at Imperial ports not only on  the [[Bay of Catazar]], but also in Dawnish and Varushkan ports on [[The Semmerlak]].
