## Overview
The ''[[Quaymaster of the Elosian Docks]]'' is an [[Imperial Title]], responsible for overseeing the Elosian Docks, part of the Imperial docks at Elos in [[Redoubt]]. It is elected by [[Urizen]] citizens that hold mana sites via [[Tally of the Votes]]
The Black Sails Quay is dedicated to the use of ships from [[Axos]] involved in trading valuable Axou [[White granite|white granite]] for Imperial [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] - a material that is in some demand in [[Axos]]. Following the proposals submitted by Hesychia of Elos, the [[Imperial Senate]] authorised an outfitting of the docks to welcome Axou [[Traders|traders]] - particularly those from Hesychia's [[Family|family]] back in [[Axos]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Quaymaster of the Elosian Docks]] is expected to ensure that the citadels of [[Axos]] continue to exchange [[White granite|white granite]] for Imperial dragonbone. If this trade, or the Elosian Docks, were ever directly threatened, the Quaymaster would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity|opportunity]] related to them. The continued operation of the quays, and thus the [[Ministry|ministry]], requires that relations between [[The Empire|the Empire]] and [[Axos]] remain cordial - the Quaymaster thus has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

### [[Ministry]]
As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Quaymaster of the Elosian Docks]] allows the holder to purchase wains of white granite at a set price. The Quaymaster makes their decision how much dragonbone to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. The dragonbone is removed from, and wains of white granite are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the [[Spring]] Equinox. The Quaymaster of the Elosian Dock is appointed by citizens of [[Urizen]] who control the [[Mana site]] personal resources. The larger the [[Mana site|mana site]] an individual has the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only an [[Urizen]] citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## Elosian Docks
Elos is a [[Spire|spire]] in Naris, [[Redoubt]], a base for what little navy [[Urizen]] retained from its time prior to joining [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Before the construction of specialist trading docks here, it was a quiet fishing village, much overlooked by merchants and [[Traders|traders]] despite its extensive quayside and fortified harbour wall. Now, with dedicated facilities for Axou ships bearing white granite, it draws in increasing attention from citizens looking to trade valuable resources, inspiring further proposals to continue to expand the dockyards even further.
