## Overview
The ''[[Quaymaster of the Elosian Docks]]'' is an [[Imperial Title]], responsible for overseeing the Elosian Docks, part of the Imperial docks at Elos in [[Redoubt]]. It is elected by [[Urizen]] citizens that hold Mana sites via [[Tally of the Votes]]
The Black Sails Quay is dedicated to the use of ships from [[Axos]] involved in trading valuable Axou [[White granite]] for Imperial dragonbone - a material that is in some demand in Axos. Following the proposals submitted by Hesychia of Elos, the [[Imperial Senate]] authorised an outfitting of the docks to welcome Axou traders - particularly those from Hesychia's [[Family]] back in Axos.
## Responsibilities
The Quaymaster of the Elosian Docks is expected to ensure that the citadels of Axos continue to exchange white granite for Imperial dragonbone. If this trade, or the Elosian Docks, were ever directly threatened, the Quaymaster would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity]] related to them. The continued operation of the quays, and thus the [[Ministry]], requires that relations between [[The Empire]] and Axos remain cordial - the Quaymaster thus has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

### Ministry
As a Ministry, the title of Quaymaster of the Elosian Docks allows the holder to purchase wains of white granite at a set price. The Quaymaster makes their decision how much dragonbone to spend during downtime from their character page. The dragonbone is removed from, and wains of white granite are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Spring Equinox. The Quaymaster of the Elosian Dock is appointed by citizens of Urizen who control the [[Mana site]] personal resources. The larger the mana site an individual has the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only an Urizen citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## Elosian Docks
Elos is a [[Spire]] in Naris, Redoubt, a base for what little navy Urizen retained from its time prior to joining the Empire. Before the construction of specialist trading docks here, it was a quiet fishing village, much overlooked by merchants and traders despite its extensive quayside and fortified harbour wall. Now, with dedicated facilities for Axou ships bearing white granite, it draws in increasing attention from citizens looking to trade valuable resources, inspiring further proposals to continue to expand the dockyards even further.
