## Overview
The [[Guardian]] of Britta's Memorial is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] which was originally created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Winter]] 376YE. The position of guardian was a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income.
Following the death of [[Empress Britta]] in 376YE, heroic efforts recovered her body and many of her effects from the [[Thule]] [[Barbarians|barbarians]]. The body was interred in the swamps of [[Kallavesa]] while her personal accoutrements were placed in a shrine of [[White granite|white granite]] in [[Necropolis]]. The [[Eternal|eternal]] flame that burns in the courtyard before the memorial serves as a place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for those wishing to meditate on and show their respects to the departed Empress, whose inspirational example is already seen by many as re-igniting the flame of Imperial [[Pride]] following the disastrous reigns of [[Empress Giselle]], [[Emperor Hugh]] and [[Emperor Walter]].
Some controversy surrounded the [[Sinecure|sinecure]]; it was regarded as unconstitutional since it created votes in [[The Synod|the Synod]] but was appointed by [[The Senate|the Senate]], allowing the [[Senate]] undue influence the [[Synod]]. The motion was not struck down by [[Magistrates|magistrates]] at the time, however, and so the title stood.
The first Guardian of Britta's Tomb was ''[[Ruth]] of [[Highguard]]'', a [[Steward]] of the Dead belonging to the Cenotaph [[Chapter|chapter]] of [[Necropolis]]. In [[Autumn]] 379YE, a delegation of Highborn and Winterfolk visited the shrine and removed the personal effects of the Young Empress. They were reunited with her body in [[Kallavesa]]. As news spread, the stream of pilgrims traveling to the shrine dropped to a trickle and then largely petered out. By the beginning of the [[Spring]] Equinox 380YE, the title of Guardian had become a purely ceremonial title, providing neither votes nor [[Liao|liao]].
During the Winter Solstice 383YE the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to amend the shrine, creating instead a memorial to the [[Courage]] demonstrated by the Young Empress.
## Responsibilities
The Guardian oversees the memorial dedicated to the virtue of the dead Empress, and ensures the [[Eternal|eternal]] flame is not extinguished.
## Powers
### A Portion of [[Liao]]
The sinecure provides five doses of Liao to the Guardian each season, to be used as they see fit.
### Voice in the Synod
The Guardian of Britta's Memorial may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 10 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 10 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any [[Assembly|assembly]] they are eligible for.
## [[Appointment]]
The Guardian is a virtue position which is appointed by [[Judgement]] of the [[Courage]] [[Assembly|assembly]] at the Spring Equinox.
The title can be held by any Imperial citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Assembly of Courage, and the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
