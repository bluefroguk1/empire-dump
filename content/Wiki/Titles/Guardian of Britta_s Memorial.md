## Overview
The Guardian of Britta's Memorial is an [[Imperial Title]] which was originally created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 376YE. The position of guardian was a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income.
Following the death of [[Empress Britta]] in 376YE, heroic efforts recovered her body and many of her effects from the [[Thule]] barbarians. The body was interred in the swamps of [[Kallavesa]] while her personal accoutrements were placed in a shrine of [[White granite]] in [[Necropolis]]. The [[Eternal]] flame that burns in the courtyard before the memorial serves as a place of PilgriPilgrimage for those wishing to meditate on and show their respects to the departed Empress, whose inspirational example is already seen by many as re-igniting the flame of Imperial [[Pride]] following the disastrous reigns of [[Empress Giselle]], [[Emperor Hugh]] and [[Emperor Walter]].
Some controversy surrounded the sinecure; it was regarded as unconstitutional since it created votes in the Synod but was appointed by the Senate, allowing the Senate undue influence the Synod. The motion was not struck down by magistrates at the time, however, and so the title stood.
The first Guardian of Britta's Tomb was ''[[Ruth]] of [[Highguard]]'', a [[Steward]] of the Dead belonging to the Cenotaph [[Chapter]] of Necropolis. In Autumn 379YE, a delegation of Highborn and Winterfolk Visited the shrine and removed the personal effects of the Young Empress. They were reunited with her body in Kallavesa. As news spread, the stream of pilgrims traveling to the shrine dropped to a trickle and then largely petered out. By the beginning of the Spring Equinox 380YE, the title of Guardian had become a purely ceremonial title, providing neither votes nor [[Liao]].
During the Winter Solstice 383YE the Imperial Senate voted to aMend the shrine, creating instead a memorial to the [[Courage]] demonstrated by the Young Empress.
## Responsibilities
The Guardian oversees the memorial dedicated to the virtue of the dead Empress, and ensures the eternal flame is not extinguished.
## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides five doses of Liao to the Guardian each season, to be used as they see fit.
### Voice in the Synod
The Guardian of Britta's Memorial may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 10 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 10 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any [[Assembly]] they are eligible for.
## [[Appointment]]
The Guardian is a virtue position which is appointed by [[Judgement]] of the Courage assembly at the Spring Equinox.
The title can be held by any Imperial citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Assembly of Courage, and the Assembly of the Nine.
