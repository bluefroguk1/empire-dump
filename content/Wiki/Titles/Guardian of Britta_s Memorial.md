## Overview
The Guardian of Britta's Memorial is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] which was originally [[Construct shrine for Britta's body|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 376YE. The position of guardian was a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income.
Following the death of [[Empress Britta]] in 376YE, heroic efforts recovered her body and many of her effects from the [[Thule]] barbarians. The body was interred in the swamps of [[Kallavesa]] while her personal accoutrements were placed in a [[Necropolis#The Shrine of Britta|shrine of white granite]] in [[Necropolis]]. The eternal flame that burns in the courtyard before the memorial serves as a place of pilgrimage for those wishing to meditate on and show their respects to the departed Empress, whose inspirational example is already seen by many as re-igniting the flame of Imperial [[Pride]] following the disastrous reigns of [[Empress Giselle]], [[Emperor Hugh]] and [[Emperor Walter]].
Some controversy surrounded the sinecure; it was regarded as unconstitutional since it created votes in the Synod but was appointed by the Senate, allowing the Senate undue influence the Synod. The motion was not struck down by magistrates at the time, however, and so the title stood.
The first Guardian of Britta's Tomb was ''Ruth of Highguard'', a [[Highguard religious beliefs#Steward of the Dead|Steward of the Dead]] belonging to the Cenotaph chapter of Necropolis. In Autumn 379YE, a delegation of Highborn and [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]] visited the shrine and removed the personal effects of the Young Empress. They were [[To sleep in Kallavesa|reunited with her body]] in Kallavesa. As news spread, the stream of pilgrims traveling to the shrine dropped to a trickle and then largely petered out. By the beginning of the Spring Equinox 380YE, the title of Guardian had become a purely ceremonial title, providing neither votes nor liao.
During the Winter Solstice 383YE the Imperial Senate voted to [[383YE Winter Solstice Senate sessions#Amend Guardian of Britta.27s Shrine II|amend]] the shrine, creating instead a memorial to the [[Courage]] demonstrated by the Young Empress.
