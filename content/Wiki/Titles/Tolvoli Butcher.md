### The Red Harvest
As a [[Ministry]], the Tolvoli Butcher can exchange animal blood for unique consumables at a set price. The Tolvoli Butcher spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
The grove near Tolvoli produces three different types of elixir depending on the quality and quantity of the blood provided. ''Bloodvine Liquor'' is a sweet, thick, gloopy substance that provides additional power to a magician working [[Spring magic]], provided they spill copious amounts of their own blood in the casting. A ''Blackblood Thorn'' is razor-sharp and must be thrust into the skin when performing [[Winter magic]] to provide a burst of additional power, but leaves a stinging wound that may take some time to [[Heal]] completely. ''Darkwine'' is a euphemistic name for a bitter alcoholic infusion that looks like blood and smells of honey, and grants vigorous health for a time. All three are tonics.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. The Tolvoli Butcher is appointed by citizens of [[Varushka]] who control Mines and Forests personal resources. The larger the resource an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only a Varushkan citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
