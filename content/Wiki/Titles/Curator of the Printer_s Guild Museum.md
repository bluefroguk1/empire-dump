## Overview
The position was [[Construct Printer's Guild Museum of Wonders|established]] by a motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Spring Equinox 379YE. At the time, there were some concerns from the [[Scrutiny#Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] about the way the [[Sinecure]] involved was presented, which were resolved in the Senate during the Autumn Equinox 379YE.
The museum itself was constructed to provide a suitable venue to display the extensive collection of unique and historical artifacts gathered by the Printer's Guild- a [[The League|League]] [[Guild]] that provides printing services throughout the Empire, and publishes the popular Pledge newspaper. 
## Responsibilities
The Curator of the Printer's Guild Museum is responsible for maintaining the museum itself, and for acquiring new exhibits. If anything were to threaten the good operation of the museum, it would be the responsibility of the Curator to address those problems.
## Powers
### Point of Pilgrimage
The Printer's Guild Museum of Wonders is a [[Sinecure]] overseen by the Curator who receives 6 [[Liao]] and 12 votes in the Imperial Synod. These votes can be used in any and all [[Sinecure#Synod Votes|appropriate assemblies]] for which the Curator is eligible.
## Appointment
The [[Cardinal]] of [[Prosperity]] appoints the Curator of the Printer's Guild Museum. As an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]], it may be held by any Imperial citizen. 
While the assumption with most sinecures is that the Curator hold the position until they die or step down, the Curator is appointed by a [[Cardinal]]. As such, when a new [[Cardinal of Prosperity]] is appointed they may choose to name a replacement. The Curator can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by a lesser majority of either the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], or the Prosperity [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|virtue assembly]].
## The Printer's Guild Museum of Wonders
Situated just off the western bank of the river Vassa, in the League city of [[Tassato#Tassato Mestra|Tassato Mestra]], the home of the Printers Guild Museum of Wonders is an impressive building.
Hoardings covers the walls of surrounding streets, advertising the wondrous items of mystery to be found within the confines of this fabulous establishment. Street hawkers connive and convince to drive the crowds forwards. Resplendent [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgists]] in fanciful costumes of the foreign realms beckon the credulous public towards the entrance. Knifing through the crowds are [[Bravo|bravos]] and sell-swords, keeping the peace with a light touch and stern gaze, allowing the adventurous souls from calm [[Tassato#Tassato Regario|Regario]] to make their way to the Museum with a thrill of wonder, but none of Mestra's usual menace.
Fine white granite columns dominate the fascia of the Museum, with a grand staircase leading to the main entrance. In the hallway are inscriptions proclaiming the generosity of the Printers Guild, with busts of Silvio de Tassato, the main benefactor, and Jonah Yakovitch, the [[The League leadership|Prince]] of the Guild, staring down on the heaving masses.
There are five main collections, catalogued by Gancius of the Carta Notturno. Objects of Historical Significance, Relics of the Precursor Nations, Treasures of the Eternal Realms, Curios from Foreign Lands and the Catalogue of Natural Wonders. Each is housed within its own area of the Museum, with its own experts and archivists tirelessly working to Gancius' scheme. The collections rotate on a frequent basis, to drive attendance, constantly staying fresh and new. One month a display of the secrets of the Night [[Eternal|eternals]], the next a history of trade with the [[Commonwealth]], then a display of the pilgrims of the Way. Each exhibition comes replete with new and exciting artefacts, unique events and fresh dramaturgical performances on the streets outside.
As the days draw to an end, the public exhibits close and private tours commence for the wealthy patrons of the Museum. This is a chance to get close to the wondrous items, to hold some of the less fragile and to connect with the history of the Empire.
A constant stream of scholars from other nations travel to the museum. Away from the hustle and bustle of the main galleries, these learned souls reverentially research and cross reference, sharing their own knowledge with the curators, such that the truth of history can be discovered.
Coin flows through this endeavour at a prodigious rate. Tickets are brought, keepsakes and souvenirs sold to one and all. Food and drink for the weary traveller, all bring Throne after Throne through the door. Generous donations from patrons, rings thrown to street performers, all go into the upkeep of this fine institution.
Just as quickly, the money is spent. As a prosperous enterprise, it is not really in the business of being a business, there is no long term profit sought, nor investors to placate. Acquisition of artefacts and relics, the employ of performers, guards and researchers, and the maintenance of the buildings and surrounding streets.
