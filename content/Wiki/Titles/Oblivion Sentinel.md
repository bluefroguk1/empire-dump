## Overview
The [[Oblivion Sentinel]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[Urizen]]. Construction of the Mithril Sculptures was [[Construct Mithril Sculptures|passed]] by the Imperial Senate during the Summer Solstice 385YE following an opportunity presented by the Night eternal [[Sung]]. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Oblivion Sentinel]] is responsible for maintaining a watch over the Black Plateau and deal with any threats associated with it, at the very least this means taking charge of any quests or skirmishes involving the broken ones attracted to [[Spiral#Screed|Screed]], but could also involve more esoteric threats. In addition if the mithril sculptures were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the [[Oblivion Sentinel]] to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Alert to the Plateau
The Oblivion Sentinel benefits from a unique gift from [[Sung]]; the eternal will ensure that the Sentinel is always alerted to any significant change in the Black Plateau.
### Gift from Sung
The Oblivion Sentinel receives a single ''feather talisman'' each season, a simple magical trinket that smooths the way towards [[Clear Counsel of the Everflowing River|seeking her counsel on matters of mystery]].
## Appointment
The Oblivion Sentinel is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. It is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] [[General]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Military Council]] instead.
The title can be held by any Urizen citizen. The Sentinel serves until the next scheduled election. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Urizen [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
