## Overview
The [[Oblivion Sentinel]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[Urizen]]. Construction of the [[Mithril]] Sculptures was passed by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the [[Summer]] Solstice 385YE following an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] presented by the [[Night]] [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Sung]]. 
## Responsibilities
The Oblivion [[Sentinel]] is responsible for maintaining a watch over the [[Black Plateau]] and deal with any threats associated with it, at the very least this means taking charge of any quests or skirmishes involving the broken ones attracted to Screed, but could also involve more esoteric threats. In addition if the [[Mithril|mithril]] sculptures were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the [[Oblivion Sentinel]] to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Alert to the Plateau
The Oblivion [[Sentinel]] benefits from a unique gift from [[Sung]]; the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Will|will]] ensure that [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] is always alerted to any significant change in the [[Black Plateau]].
### Gift from [[Sung]]
The [[Oblivion Sentinel]] receives a single ''feather talisman'' each season, a simple magical trinket that smooths [[The Way|the way]] towards seeking her counsel on matters of mystery.
## [[Appointment]]
The Oblivion [[Sentinel]] is appointed during the [[Autumn]] Equinox each year. It is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] [[General]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Military Council]] instead.
The title can be held by any [[Urizen]] citizen. [[The Sentinel]] serves until the next scheduled election. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Urizen]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
