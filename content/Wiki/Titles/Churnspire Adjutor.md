## Churnspire
The Churnspire was built with a solid foundation of [[White granite]], and the [[Spire|spire]] towers over the Churn, one of the most volatile geysers located in Peregro. The [[Spire|spire]] is largely dedicated to luxurious apartments for the Adjutor with art depicting a great tower looming over a shrouded lake common throughout. A small turret projects out and overlooks the geyser. The only way to access the turret is through a corridor inlaid with [[Mithril]] which glistens during the hours of twilight.
