## The Pilgrims' Annexe
During the Winter Solstice 378 YE, the Senate approved an annexe to the [[Spire|spire]] of the Imperial Academy. A light, airy, octagonal building was constructed at the base of the Canterspire. Each face is decorated and illustrated with [[Symbols of the Way|symbols of The Way]], and with images of famous [[Paragons and Exemplars]].

As the threat of the [[Druj]] against [[Urizen]] grew, the Academy staff took the difficult decision to move from Canterspire to the Castle of Thorns in [[Astolat]].

While the title technically still exists, it has no powers, and has not been reappointed.
