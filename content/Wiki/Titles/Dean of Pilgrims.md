__TOC__
## [[Appointment]]
The Dean of Pilgrims was an Imperial position appointed by the Senate. Any Imperial citizen could hold the title. The Dean had tenure, and served until they die or stepped down. They could be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## The Pilgrims' Annexe
During the Winter Solstice 378 YE, the Senate approved an annexe to the [[Spire]] of the Imperial Academy. A light, airy, octagonal building was constructed at the base of the Canterspire. Each face is decorated and illustrated with Symbols of [[Symbols of the Way]], and with iMages of famous [[Paragons and Exemplars]]. Illustrated scrolls, books, and other learning [[Materials]] are stored in a number side areas, waiting patiently to be used by pupils. It also contains a record of donations to the Academy, as well as the stores of additional liao themselves.
As the threat of the [[Druj]] against [[Urizen]] grew, The Academy staff took the difficult decision to move from Canterspire to the Castle of Thorns in [[Astolat]]. As a consequence the Annexe was abandoned, and the Dean of Pilgrims lost access to their sinecure. While the title technically still exists, it has no powers, and has not been reappointed.
