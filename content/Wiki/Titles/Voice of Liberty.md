## Overview
The [[Voice of Liberty]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the Senate. The title was created during the Spring Equinox 383YE, and represents [[The Empire]] at meetings of the Liberty Pact. Ratified by the Senate during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the Liberty Pact was created as a political and economic alliance between the Empire, the [[Sumaah Republic]], the [[Commonwealth]], and the Citadels of [[Axos]]. It is dedicated to ending slavery in the known world, initially by enforcing trade [[Sanctions]] on nations that do not disavow the abhorrent practice.
As evidenced by the 384YE raid on the Asavean city of Chalonsio, and the destruction of the Slave Lords of Rachensgrab, it is clear that the alliance is also capable of taking proactive steps to disCourage slavery in the wider world. The pact was aMended by the Senate during the Summer Solstice 385YE, to clarify how meetings of the Liberty Pact might be called, and to make clear that no signatory was required to offer military aid to another - but it would be illegal to offer military aid to someone attacking a signatory.
==Responsibilities== 
The Voice of Liberty is responsible for representing the Empire during any meetings of the members of the international Liberty Pact.
## Powers
### Amendment
The Voice of Liberty is able to present an amendment to the International Liberty Pact for consideration by the Senate. A [[Senator]] must use a [[Senate motion]] to submit the amendment for ratification by the Senate - but ratification only requires a single senate motion, regardless of how many legal changes are required to ratify the amendment.
__TOC__
Ratification of an amendment is considered to be a single motion before the Senate because the Senate can either choose to accept the amendment or reject it. It is not possible to amend an amendment once it is presented as a motion; it either passes in its entirety in the form it was submitted or it does not pass. The only legal way for the Senate to ratify variations of an amendment would be to submit different amendments as separate motions.
As a senate motion, an amendment should be carefUlly worded. It should be concise and to the point, clEarly laying out the actions to be taken as part of the amendment. Amendments are subject to [[Scrutiny]] like any other senate motion. Perhaps more so than other motions, it is sensible to have an amendment scrutinised before it is presented to the Senate.
The empress is moved. The world is moving. And we will move to a vote.
## [[Appointment]]
The Voice of Liberty is an Imperial position appointed by the Senate. Any Imperial citizen can hold this title. 
The Voice of Liberty has Tenure and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] or the Assembly of the Nine.
