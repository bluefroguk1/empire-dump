## Overview
[[Castellan of the Silent Sentinel]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by [[The Senate|the Senate]] during the [[Winter]] Solstice 381YE when they commissioned a place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] in [[Casinea]] in response to an [[Opportunity]] made possible through the research of the Heirs of [[Lepidus]]. 
## Responsibilities
The Castellan is responsible not only for the safety and wellbeing of those who visit the Silent [[Sentinel]], but for the [[Fortification|fortification]] itself. They are responsible for facing any threats to the castle, but also for making any decisions related to beneficial [[Opportunities|opportunities]] that may arise.
## Powers
### A Portion of [[Liao]]
The [[Sinecure|sinecure]] provides ten measures of [[Liao]] to the Castellan each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in [[The Synod|the Synod]]
The Castellan may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 20 votes in [[Synod]] affairs (or an additional 20 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any [[Assembly|assembly]] for which they are eligible. 
### Custodian of the Silent [[Sentinel]]
The Castellan is the custodian of the Silent [[Sentinel]]. While they are not automatically assumed to be involved in the [[Day|day]] to day operation of the [[Fortification|fortification]], they are assumed to offer direction to the garrison where necessary. If the [[Fortification|fortification]] were to be threatened in any way, it would be their responsibility of the Castellan to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any [[Opportunity]] relating to the [[Commission|commission]] presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of that. They cannot, however, take any action that would require a legal power to authorize, such as abrogating or ceding the [[Commission|commission]] (which are [[Powers of the Imperial Senate|powers of the Imperial Senate]]).
## [[Appointment]]
[[Castellan of the Silent Sentinel]] is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the Highborn [[Assembly]]. . 
The title can be held by a citizen of [[Highguard]]. The Castellan has [[Tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Highguard]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Tower of [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]]
The Silent [[Sentinel]] is one of the oldest (and some say the ugliest) [[Fortifications|fortifications]] in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. During their ongoing researches into the nature and identity of the [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[The Way|the Way]], the Heirs of [[Lepidus]] discovered proof that the castle was not only the oldest structure associated with [[The Sentinel]], but also without a shadow of a doubt the largest and most extensive. Given its position, they were prepared to venture the theory that the [[Fortification|fortification]] was most likely the abode of [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] itself. 
[[The Sentinel]] is a proud castle, but as the recognised home of one of the oldest known paragons, it is also significantly more. The [[Senate]] commissioned the construction of a grand tower and massive warning bell, incorporated into the [[Fortification|fortification]] itself as a place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]]. The tower was built using old references to a ruined tower that stood here before the Highborn turned the foundations to their own use, built of black basalt and [[White granite|white granite]] using as many of the techniques of the original [[Architect|architect]] as possible.
The tower stands above a grand hall consecrated with [[True liao|true liao]] by Rhesa, [[Exarch]] of the Scions of Ravensfell. It serves as a place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] not only for Imperial citizens but for followers of [[The Way|the Way]] across the known world.
