## Overview
[[Castellan of the Silent Sentinel]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by the Senate during the Winter Solstice 381YE when they Commissioned a place of PilgriPilgrimage in [[Casinea]] in response to an Opportunity made possible through the research of the Heirs of [[Lepidus]]. 
## Responsibilities
The Castellan is responsible not only for the safety and wellbeing of those who Visit the Silent [[Sentinel]], but for the [[Fortification]] itself. They are responsible for facing any threats to the castle, but also for making any decisions related to beneficial opportunities that may arise.
## Powers
### A Portion of [[Liao]]
The [[Sinecure]] provides ten measures of Liao to the Castellan each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in the Synod
The Castellan may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 20 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 20 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any [[Assembly]] for which they are eligible. 
### Custodian of the Silent Sentinel
The Castellan is the custodian of the Silent Sentinel. While they are not automatically assumed to be involved in the day to day operation of the fortification, they are assumed to offer direction to the garrison where necessary. If the fortification were to be threatened in any way, it would be their responsibility of the Castellan to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any Opportunity relating to the Commission presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of that. They cannot, however, take any action that would require a legal power to authorize, such as abrogating or ceding the commission (which are Powers of the [[Powers of the Imperial Senate]]).
## [[Appointment]]
Castellan of the Silent Sentinel is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the Highborn Assembly. . 
The title can be held by a citizen of [[Highguard]]. The Castellan has Tenure and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Highguard National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## The Tower of [[The Sentinel]]
The Silent Sentinel is one of the oldest (and some say the ugliest) fortifications in [[The Empire]]. During their ongoing researches into the nature and identity of the [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of [[The Way]], the Heirs of Lepidus discovered proof that the castle was not only the oldest structure associated with The Sentinel, but also without a shadow of a doubt the largest and most extensive. Given its position, they were prepared to venture the theory that the fortification was most likely the abode of The the Sentinel itself. 
The Sentinel is a proud castle, but as the recognised home of one of the oldest known paragons, it is also significantly more. The Senate commissioned the construction of a grand tower and massive Warning bell, incorporated into the fortification itself as a place of [[Pilgrimage]]. The tower was built using old references to a Ruined tower that stood here before the Highborn turned the foundations to their own use, built of black basalt and [[White granite]] using as many of the techniques of the original [[Architect]] as possible.
The tower stands above a grand hall consecrated with True true liao by Rhesa, Exarch of the Scions of Ravensfell. It serves as a place of pilgrimage not only for Imperial citizens but for followers of the Way across the known world.
