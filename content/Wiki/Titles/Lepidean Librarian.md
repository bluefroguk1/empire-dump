## Overview
The [[Lepidean Librarian]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the Highborn National [[Assembly]]. It was established by [[The Senate|the Senate]] in [[Winter]] 383YE alongside the construction of the Lepidean University in [[Bastion]], following the plans of the esteemed Frederick di [[Sarvos]].
## Responsibilities
The Librarian is responsible for the preservation of the Lepidean University and the historical accounts it contains. In practice, the [[Day|day]]-to-day management of [[The Library|the library]] and its records is performed by the Heirs of [[Lepidus]], leaving the Librarian free to devote their time to other matters if they so choose.
## Power
### [[Historical research|Historical Research]]
The Librarian has the power to direct the research of the scholars of the University. This functions as an additional [[Historical research]] request that does not count against the limit (currently one) that the Department for Historical Research is able to [[Conduct|conduct]] each season. This research can only be used to investigate the lives of paragons or exemplars, or into the details of past life visions. 
To use this power, the Librarian provides an announcement to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the [[Imperial Senate]]. No voting is possible by the [[Senate]], as the power has been delegated to the Librarian. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Librarian's decision.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Lepidean Librarian]] is a national position which is appointed by [[Judgement]] of the Highborn [[Assembly|assembly]]. Any Highborn citizen may hold this title.
The Librarian is appointed during the [[Spring]] Equinox each year. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Highborn Assembly, and the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Lepidean University
The original Lepidean Library was constructed by the Heirs of [[Lepidus]], a [[Chapter]] of stewards of the dead dedicated to finding and recovering records of [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]]. Initially founded by the Highborn ''Assembly of the Virtuous'' to identify inspirational Highborn, their efforts quickly expanded to include identifying potential [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] among other human nations.
The original chapterhouse contained a considerable collection of writings and records relating to these historic inspirational figures, and was considered the most respected college for the study of [[The Way|the Way]] in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. During the rampage of [[Emperor Nicovar]], [[The Library|the library]] was one of the earliest [[Casualties|casualties]], burnt to the ground along with centuries of archives, and the [[Chapter|chapter]] relocated to much smaller premises in Woodbury.
For a time, the area where the chapter-house once stood was maintained as a public park, but following the grand designs of Frederick di [[Sarvos]], the [[Imperial Senate]] commissioned a restoration of the structure, including the ''Garden of [[Atun]]'', grounds dedicated to cultivating vinum and other resources necessary for the refinement of [[Liao]]. So extensive is this operation that it produces an additional dose of [[True liao|True Liao]] each season, which is added to the Virtue Fund of the [[Imperial Synod]] to be distributed by [[Judgement]] of [[Rewarding]].
Completed following the Winter Solstice 383YE, the newly-rebuilt University is dedicated to not just the study of philosophy, morality, and religion but other topics that exalt the human (and orc) spirit - the arts and humanities. The edifice stands as a new monument to the importance of [[The Way|the Way]] in [[Highguard]] and, indeed, [[The Empire|the Empire]].
