## Overview
Dunfrith was [[Construct Dunfrith|commissioned]] by the [[Civilian Commissioner]] of [[Wintermark]] in Autumn 380YE. Construction of Dunfrith (a name meaning "forest of Dun" in an obscure Wintermark dialect) was completed shortly after the 380YE Autumn Equinox. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Guardian of Dunfrith]] has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of herbs from Dunfrith in Wood Heath. If Dunfrith were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Guardian to deal with those threats - it is also their responsibility to deal with any [[Opportunity]] related to the sinecure.
## Powers
### Bounty of the Guardian
The Guardian receives custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. They receive an income of herbs each season: five doses each of [[Bladeroot]], [[True Vervain]], and [[Marrowort]]; four doses of [[Imperial Roseweald]]; and two doses of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]]. Bladeroot and True Vervain prosper in the northern hills, and the glade set aside for the production of Marrowort supports a fine crop, but the gardeners struggle to maintain more than a few patches of Cerulean Mazzarine in the chilly climate.
## Appointment
The Guardian of Drunfirth is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Wintermark]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a Wintermark citizen. The Guardian has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wintermark [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## Dunfirth
The foresters of [[Hahnmark#Woodhall|Woodhall]] in the southernmost reaches of [[Hahnmark]] created several glades in the woodlands near Dunhearth Hall. The glades were positioned to allow the cultivation of all five of the magical [[Herbs]]. Much of the work creating the sinecure was overseen by Ham, son of Brigantia, son of Frecki and of Bruin, lead apothecary of Dunhearth and descendant of the Great Dun, apprentice of Wise Rangara and Saviour of Holberg, "with the authority of the Great Thane, Tobrytan Dunning". 
One of the glades, the southernmost of the five, was cleared over an old battleground where the people of Dunhearth fought the [[Feni]] in past centuries - the harvest of [[Marrowort]] is particularly strong here although there have been a few (unconfirmed) reports of unsettled spirits in the vicinity since the herb garden was established.
In Summer 381YE, a [[Rocks and gravel|natural disaster]] claimed parts of south-eastern [[Hahnmark]]. The opening of [[Delver of the Depths#Lorenzo.27s Deep Pockets|Lorenzo's Deep Pockets]] (as the sinkhole is known) stopped just short of consuming the entire forest of Dunfirth. Today the herb glades stand on the north-western lip of the great crater, not far from [[Caretaker of New Dunhall#New Dunhall|New Dunhall]].
