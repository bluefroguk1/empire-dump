## Overview
The Seward of Good Leaf Gardens is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a Marcher citizen. It is a national position appointed by vote of Marcher citizens who own a [[Farm]]. The position is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income drawn from the profits provided by [[Navarr]] [[Herb|herb]] [[Traders|traders]].
The [[Wayhouse]] was built as an [[Opportunity]] arising from a [[Statement of Principle]] by Corey Brackensong in the [[Navarr]] national [[Assembly|assembly]] relating to [[Rewarding|rewarding]] Marcher generals for their support in [[Liathaven]]. Establishing the [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]] required a sacrifice from the Navarr [[Herb garden]] owners, inspired by a [[Guide|guide]] named ''Morgan of Brock Bottom [[Steading]]''.
## Responsibilities
The [[Steward]] is responsible for sharing the [[Herbs|herbs]] donated to the Wayhouse with the people of [[The Marches|the Marches]] who need them.
## Powers
### Brokers' Bounty
The [[Steward]] has no legal powers, but receives donations of Herbs from Navarr [[Traders|traders]] passing through [[Upwold]]. Each season the steward receives 10 doses of [[True Vervain]], and 5 doses each of [[Imperial Roseweald]], [[Bladeroot]], [[Marrowort]], and [[Cerulean Mazzarine]].
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the [[Winter]] Solstice by citizens of [[The Marches|the Marches]] who control [[Farm]] personal resources.

Only a Marcher character may hold the title.  As a title in the [[Bourse]], they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]]
## Good Leaf Gardens
The Wayhouse is an unassuming building built in southern Birchland at the point where the road from Ashbrook turns south toward King's Stoke. It lies not far from the [[Trod|trod]] that runs north through the [[Forest|forest]] toward [[Kallavesa]]. Traders make a point of passing near the wayhouse, and leaving bundles of herbs donated by Navarr from all across [[The Empire|the Empire]], given in thanks for the continuing support of the [[Marches]] in fighting [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]].
The wayhouse is a meld of architectural styles - built of sturdy [[Weirwood|weirwood]] it would not stand out in any Marcher village unless one were to look closely and mark the many little touches and flourishes inspired by the [[Steadings|steadings]] of [[Miaren]].
