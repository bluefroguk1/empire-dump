## Overview
The SeWard of Good Leaf Gardens is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a Marcher citizen. It is a national position appointed by vote of Marcher citizens who own a [[Farm]]. The position is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income drawn from the profits provided by [[Navarr]] Herb traders.
The [[Wayhouse]] was built as an Opportunity arising from a [[Statement of Principle]] by Corey Brackensong in the Navarr national [[Assembly]] relating to [[Rewarding]] Marcher Generals for their support in [[Liathaven]]. Establishing the wayhouse required a sacrifice from the Navarr [[Herb garden]] owners, inSpired by a guide named ''Morgan of Brock Bottom Steading''.
## Responsibilities
The [[Steward]] is responsible for sharing the herbs donated to the Wayhouse with the people of [[The Marches]] who need them.
## Powers
### Brokers' Bounty
The Steward has no legal powers, but receives donations of Herbs from Navarr traders passing through [[Upwold]]. Each season the steward receives 10 doses of True Vervain, and 5 doses each of [[Imperial Roseweald]], [[Bladeroot]], [[Marrowort]], and [[Cerulean Mazzarine]].
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice by citizens of the Marches who control Farm personal resources. The larger the farm an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only a Marcher character may hold the title.  As a title in the Bourse, they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]]
## Good Leaf Gardens
The Wayhouse is an unassuming building built in southern Birchland at the point where the road from Ashbrook turns south toward King's Stoke. It lies not far from the [[Trod]] that runs north through the Forest toward [[Kallavesa]]. Traders make a point of passing near the wayhouse, and leaving bundles of herbs donated by Navarr from all across [[The Empire]], given in thanks for the continuing support of the Marches in Fighting The [[The Vallorn]].
The Wayhouse is a meld of Architectural styles - built of sturdy [[Weirwood]] it would not stand out in any Marcher village unless one were to look closely and mark the many little touches and flourishes inspired by the steadings of [[Miaren]].
