## Overview
The Bonesetter of the Torfast Trading Post is an [[Imperial Title]] aWarded to an Imperial Orc citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in Delev.
In the past, the Winterfolk maintained trade routes south and west from the town of Torfast in southern [[Skarsind]]. In the years since Skarsind was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the [[Wintermark]] focus was more on the routes through the passes into [[Hahnmark]] in the north-east. When the Winterfolk withdrew from Skarsind, and the [[Imperial Orcs]] claimed it, several of their bonesetters began to look east and south, eager for the [[Opportunity]] to restore the valuable trade routes with [[Hercynia]], [[Temeschwar]], and [[Karov]].
Similar trading posts were established in the Glen of Shadows, in Temeschwar city, and eventually in Delev in Karov (the Treji Northern [[Wayhouse]], the Northern Traders [[Guild]], and the mercantile office of the Overseer of the Westward Road respectively). These improved the opportunities in Torfast, widening the range of goods that could be acquired to include herbs from Hercynia, metals from Temeschwar, and the bounty of the Forests of [[Varushka]].
In Summer 381YE, in response to an Opportunity offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner joined the Northern Trade Network bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire]] remains at peace with the Thule. Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the forests of Metri threatened to sever Temeschwar from the network, leading to instability along the trade routes, reducing the options available via the southern trade route. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] were instructed to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  disruption to trade end.
During the Summer of 385YE, following the construction of the Temeschwar-Otkodov Mana Exchange far more traders from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead. The completion of the Iron Roads saw an influx of Varushkan trade goods passing through Delev Market in Karov, providing additional opportunities to purchase goods from them.
## Responsibilities
The Bonesetter is expected to keep the trade flowing along the roads that lead from Skarsind south through Temeschwar, east into Varushka, and west into Hercynia. The close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Bonesetter to acquire supplies at bargain prices. If one of the three existing trade routes were endangered, the production of the Torfast Trading Post would be endangered, and the Bonesetter would likely be responsible for working with representatives of the other nation to restore it.

As a Ministry, the title of [[Bonesetter of Torfast Trading Post]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials]] at a set price. The Bonesetter makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
Unlike a standard ministry, the Torfast Trading Post deals with merchants from four neighbouring territories - Hercynia, Temeschwar, Karov, and Urdur in Otkodov. As such, the Bonesetter has not one but ''four'' streams from which they can purchase material. The Bonesetter can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 17 crowns on one, 7 on another, and none on the third and fourth.
The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and thanks to the Iron Roads offers additional opportunities to buy goods. This additional opportunity remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable materials easily through Delev market.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions]] on trade with Otkodov during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost]] to purchase crystal mana increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the crystal mana and the orichalcum were ''both'' subject to [[Tariffs]] when they crossed the border with the Thule nation. The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to aMend tariffs on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them free trade which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before sanctions were imposed.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Spring Equinox by Imperial Orcs who control [[Military unit]] personal resources who supported an [[Imperial army]] during the previous year. The larger the military unit an individual has, and the more often they supported the Imperial armies, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only an Imperial Orc character may hold this title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. They cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
