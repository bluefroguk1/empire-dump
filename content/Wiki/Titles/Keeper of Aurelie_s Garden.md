## Overview
The Keeper of Aurelie's Garden is an [[Imperial Title]] Commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 380YE. The position of keeper is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of valuable herbs. [[The Garden]] is in the Region of Grovesyard, [[Astolat]], near the hospital Aurelie's Rest. 
During the Summer Solstice 383YE, following some considerable confusion about how the title was appointed, the civil service proposed an administrative motion to AMend Aurelie's Garden. The method of [[Appointment]] was changed to unanimous decision of the Senators of [[Navarr]] and [[Dawn]], in a similar fashion to [[The Way]] titles such as the Spider's Tollkeep are appointed,
## Responsibilities
The Keeper has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of herbs from the Aurelie's Garden. If the Garden were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Keeper to deal with those threats. 
## Powers
### Bounty of Herbs
The Keeper gains custodianship of a Sinecure. Each season they receive 10 doses of [[Imperial Roseweald]], and 2 doses each of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], True Vervain, [[Marrowort]], and [[Bladeroot]].
## Appointment
The Keeper of Aurelie's Garden is appointed by unanimous decision of the senators of Dawn and Navarr. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the Imperial Senate instead. The intention is that the senators will ensure that a suitable contest to identify the appropriate candidate is arranged and overseen. Legally, however, all that is required to appoint the title is a unanimous agreement between the senators of Dawn and Navarr.
The title can be held by either a Navarr citizen or a citizen of Dawn.The Keeper serves for a year, until they die, or until they step down.
In accordance with its peculiar method of appointment, the title can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Navarr National Assembly, the National Assembly of Dawn, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
