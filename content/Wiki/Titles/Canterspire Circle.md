## Overview
The [[Canterspire Circle]] (or more correctly, Circles) are located on the slopes of the Operus mountains in the [[Urizen]] Territory of [[Morrow]]. Custodianship of the Circle grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Weirwood]]
## The Resource
The lower slopes of Canterspire are marked by strange circles of weirwood that grow rapidly despite the barren soil. All the trees grow in this circular pattern; despite a great deal of research no rational explanation has ever been found for this phenomenon. There is some agreement that whatever it is, it is not [[Magic]] - even allowing for the fact that magic rarely has any effect on living weirwood, there is no sign of any lingering [[Enchantment]] or [[Aura]] that can be discerned by the magicians who study the groves. The workers are careful never to "break" a circle - they never take more than half the trees in a given ring at any time. This is not mere superstition. In the Early days of Imperial control, three-quarters of the trees in one of The Rings were felled by mistake, and no new weirwood trees have grown in that area since. Indeed, ''nothing'' has grown in the vicinity to this day - the half-dozen ancient trees still standing are mute Sentinels over a roughly circular area of empty, open soil.
Between the trees, little grows save grass and a particularly rich snow-white heather. Some Farmers graze small herds of sheep and goats between the rings, harvesting the heather to make fine yellow dyes for which the Region is justly famous. The hills around the weirwood trees are notable because of the rich groves of beggarwood that prosper there - providing a dark ring of faster-growing trees that completely encircles the Canterspire Circle. Several of the local spires have the rights to one grove or another, and this enhances their reputation for quality cloth and leather.
According to local stories, when Urizen joined [[The Empire]] the [[Spire]] responsible for the Weirwood groves enthusiastically welcomed the [[Opportunity]] to cede their control to the Empire. The ''Spire of Golden Wood'' arranged a very equitable deal with the [[Assistance]] of [[Emperor Giovanni]] and to this day control some of the richest farms and beggarwood groves in Urizen, in return for which they offer magical support and hospitality to the workers who maintain and harvest the Canterspire Circle. They are known more for their [[Prosperity]] than for their magic, although the consummate excellence with which they prepare their signature yellow dyes, and their mastery of [[Herb]] lore, are well known and well respected.
## The Bourse Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of Weirwood which is theirs to do with as they will. If the Canterspire Circle were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular Opportunity were to arise related to the Canterspire Circle, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Canterspire Circle comes with a seat on the Imperial Bourse. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an Imperial title that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of Weirwood
The Seat has control of a source of weirwood and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 22 Imperial wains of weirwood every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all weirwood Bourse seats, the holder of the title is deterMined during the Winter Solstice. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title.
Custodianship of the Canterspire Circle is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
