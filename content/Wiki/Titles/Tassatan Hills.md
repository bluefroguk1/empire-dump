## Overview
The [[Tassatan Hills]] are located the hills about [[Tassato]] Mestra, in [[The League]] [[Territory]] of [[Tassato]]. Custodianship of the [[Tassatan Hills]] grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Ilium]].
The Hills were established by motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] at the [[Winter]] Solstice 384YE, following the plans of Gemma Stewart of [[Tassato]]
## [[The Bourse]] Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Ilium|ilium]] which is theirs to do with as they [[Will|will]]. If the [[Tassatan Hills]] were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the [[Tassatan Hills]], the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the [[Bourse]]
Custodianship of the [[Tassatan Hills]] comes with a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the [[Imperial Bourse]] as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of [[Ilium|ilium]]
The Seat has control of a source of [[Ilium|ilium]] which they receive directly. They can dispense this [[Resource|resource]] as they choose. Production is 6 rings of [[Ilium|ilium]] every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all ilium Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the [[Spring]] Equinox. Control of the Tassatan Hills is assigned to whichever [[League]] candidate receives the most support from League [[Business]] owners via the [[Tally of the Votes]]. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Custodianship of the Tassatan Hills is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An [[Imperial Bourse]] seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
