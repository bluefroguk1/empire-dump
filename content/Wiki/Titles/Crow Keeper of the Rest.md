## Overview
A [[Construct the Pilgrim's Rest|motion to construct]] the Pilgrim’s Rest in [[Kallavesa#Kallavesa Marsh|Kallavesa Marsh]], [[Kallavesa]] was entered into [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] during Autumn 380YE and passed. The sinecure was self funded by Kitsana – a Wintermark [[Wintermark religious beliefs|Stormcrow]] of [[The Way]]. This would then create the [[Imperial Title]] of ‘[[Crow Keeper of the Rest]]’.
[[Crow Keeper of the Rest]] was an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] created by the Imperial Senate in Spring 381YE. The position is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but awarded a regular income of [[Liao]] and votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] to reflect the many pilgrims taking rest on their journeys. 
The sinecure itself is a modest construction of white granite and other materials resembling a way station or inn by the side of the [[Kallavesa#The Pilgrim.27s Trail|Pilgrim’s Trail]]. The establishment offers pilgrims a place to rest before they take the last part of their journey into the marsh to lay their loved one to rest.
## Responsibilities
The [[Crow Keeper of the Rest]] is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of those who travel through the Kallavesa Marsh whilst on pilgrimage. 
## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides six measures of [[Liao]] to the Crow Keeper each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in the Synod
Crow Keeper of the Rest may sit in the Imperial Synod, and possesses 12 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 12 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly for which [[Sinecure#Synod Votes|they are eligible]]. 
## Appointment
Crow Keeper of the Rest is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the Wintermark [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|Assembly]].
The title can be held by a Wintermark citizen. The Crow Keeper has [[Tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wintermark National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## Pilgrim's Rest
Shortly after the winter gathering at Anvil of 380YE construction began on the new way station. The building itself is something akin to a roadside inn, with rooms for travellers to sleep; tables and benches for eating and drinking; a large hearth keeps the main room warm along with an ever burning brazier which is surrounded by plinths with books and maps. The books tell the stories of fallen heroes and the maps mark where they are laid to rest in the marshes. Annexed off from the alcove containing the brazier is a cold store room where fallen heroes may lay before their final journey. 
There is a kitchen that serves pilgrims all day and night with traditional Wintermark stews and meats. A bar serves drinks including ‘Kallavesa Wreck’, a wine brewed using Kitsana’s recipe. To the rear of the building are rooms that may be used by pilgrims to rest their weary feet and aching legs. In honour of a fallen hero of Wintermark and a dear old friend to Kitsana there is a constant vigil and unobtrusive presence of a now retired military unit ensuring the safety of pilgrims. Some of these ‘guards’ have taken to hearing and retelling the stories of other fallen heroes in the great Wintermark [[Wintermark culture and customs#Art and history|scop]] tradition with soft song, lively stories and sombre praise; extolling the Virtues of those who have passed and cheering the spirits of those who mourn. Along with the newfound scops is the presence of a few local Wintermark stormcrows who guide pilgrims and preach all Virtues of The Way. Some of the resident scops and priests like to imagine that, even from beyond the gulf of death, in some way Kitsana herself still uses her lamp to protect travellers in the area.
KitsanaBefore the construction of the Pilgrim’s Trail and [[Watcher of Britta's Pool|Britta’s Pool]] a Wintermark stormcrow priest by the name of Kitsana would walk the trails of the Kallavesa marshes lighting torches and lamps along the way so that pilgrims would be able to find their way through the marshes whilst taking their loved ones for burial in the Wintermark tradition. Kitsana also maintained a small hut with some basic shelters in order to offer pilgrims warmth and hospitality. While pilgrims ate their hot soup, bread and drank steeped tea or something a bit stronger Kitsana would ask to hear of the virtues of their fallen and the stories of their Names.
Once the Pilgrim’s Trail and Britta’s Pool were constructed Kitsana saw a great increase of pilgrims traveling through the swamps and marshes. She came to the decision that her simple hut and shelters would no longer be adequate and began to collect the materials needed to build something more substantial. In the autumn of 380YE the [[Senator]] for Kallavesa heard of her efforts and advised her that he would personally propose the motion to the Senate for this to be built and with a Second from the [[Senator]] for [[Semmerholm]] and the promise of self funding the motion passed.
Sadly, the day before the sinecure could be appointed for the first time, Kitsana died. The first citizen to hold the title was the stormcrow Nils Bardstrom, of Hendal Hearth.
