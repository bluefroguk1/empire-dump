During the Winter 384YE the swathe of priests of Prosperity who visited [[Zenith]] put forward a suggestion on how best to [[Write your own ending#The Lost Sinecures|rebuild]] the Starlight Drift which was [[Reconstruct Starlight Drift of Shimmering Snow]]announced by Bleakshield Groza as the [[Legion Engineer]].

## The Starlight Drift of Shimmering Snow
The Starlight Drift of Shimmering Snow was the name given to a certain cliff face near [[Zenith#Endsmeet|Endsmeet]] in [[Zenith]]. Impurities in the rock, similar to the material used to make lightstones, captured sunlight and slowly released it after sunset. It was considered a site of outstanding natural beauty. In 378YE, the decision was made to take advantage of the naturally high flows of mana around the Starlight Drift. Work began almost immediately to construct several mithril collectors that could be used to harness and focus the mana flows to produce crystal mana - without damaging this beautiful natural wonder.
When the Druj attacked Zenith in 381YE, they tore the Starlight Drift apart. The mithril collectors were ruined, and the beautiful lightstones gouged out of the rock by weeping Urizen slaves captured from the nearby spires.
Though the Drift was once a place of outstanding beauty it is now haunted by at least one ghost. The mournful spirit clearly doesn't present a serious danger however, since the Druj were able to extensively cultivate bladeroot among the ruins. These gardens still remain, and now they are tended by ushabti.
