## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Starlight Drift]] is an [[Imperial Title]] established by the [[Imperial Senate]] during [[Autumn]] 378YE.
During the 381YE [[Druj]] invasion of [[Zenith]], the Starlight Drift was destroyed by orc invaders. During the [[Winter]] 384YE the swathe of priests of [[Prosperity]] who visited [[Zenith]] put forward a suggestion on how best to rebuild the Starlight Drift which was Reconstruct Starlight Drift of Shimmering Snowannounced by Bleakshield Groza as the [[Legion Engineer]].
## Responsibilities
The Custodian is responsible for the safety of those who visit the Starlight Drift. If the Drift were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Custodian to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Bounty of the Drift
The Custodian oversees a [[Sinecure]], which provides an income of eight mana crystals and six [[Bladeroot]] each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Custodian of the Starlight Drift]] is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any [[Urizen]] citizen. The Custodian has [[Tenure|tenure]], and serves until they died or stepped down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Urizen [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Starlight Drift of Shimmering Snow
The Starlight Drift of Shimmering Snow was the name given to a certain cliff face near Endsmeet in Zenith. Impurities in the rock, similar to the material used to make lightstones, captured sunlight and slowly released it after sunset. It was considered a site of outstanding natural beauty. In 378YE, the decision was made to take advantage of the naturally high flows of mana around the Starlight Drift. Work began almost immediately to construct several [[Mithril|mithril]] collectors that could be used to harness and focus the mana flows to produce crystal mana - without damaging this beautiful natural wonder.
When the [[Druj]] attacked Zenith in 381YE, they tore the Starlight Drift apart. The [[Mithril|mithril]] collectors were ruined, and the beautiful lightstones gouged out of the rock by weeping Urizen slaves captured from the nearby [[Spires|spires]].
Though the Drift was once a place of outstanding beauty it is now haunted by at least one ghost. The mournful spirit clearly doesn't present a serious danger however, since the Druj were able to extensively cultivate [[Bladeroot|bladeroot]] among the ruins. These gardens still remain, and now they are tended by ushabti.
