## Overview
Similar to the [[Steel Fist]], the [[Gift of the Dwindling Star]] does not precisely exist within [[The Empire|the Empire]] at all. The offices that deal with the Gift are located in the isolated community of Void, in Brez, but they consist of little more than three rooms above an inn (previously the ''Red Lamb'', although it has now changed its name to the ''Red Lantern''). One room is set aside for [[Thule]] visitors, one for the Varushkan who oversees the Gift, and one between them that is used to actually pass the [[Ilium]] that the Gift provides from [[Imperial Orcs]] to human. Regardless, custodianship of the [[Gift of the Dwindling Star]] grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Ilium|ilium]] to the one who controls it.
## The [[Resource]]
The [[Opportunity]] to create the [[Gift of the Dwindling Star]] began in [[Winter]] 379YE with the appearance of an anomalous [[Red star]] in the sky. Over the next several months, the star grew in size and exerted a peculiar influence over the people of [[The Empire|the Empire]] until in [[Summer]] 380YE it became clear that the star was set on a collision course with the [[Territory]] of [[Miekarova]]. With a potentially catastrophic [[Starfall]] imminent, the [[Thule]] orcs made contact with the Varushkans to discuss a potential solution. In return for ensuring that the star struck the (apparently) largely unpopulated territory of Sküld in eastern [[Otkodov]], they would provide a share of the [[Ilium]] they were confident the star represented with the Varushkans. [[The Empire]] used a powerful [[Ritual|ritual]] to shift the trajectory of the star north, and during the [[Autumn]] Equinox 380YE it struck the [[Thule]] territory.
In the wake of the [[Starfall|starfall]], the [[Thule]] contacted [[The Empire|the Empire]], and made arrangements for a share of the [[Ilium|ilium]] to be given to the Varushkans. The [[Imperial Senate]] agreed to the arrangement, and the [[Gift of the Dwindling Star]] came into being. Every season, a [[Thule]] warlock and a small entourage spend three days visiting the [[Cabalists|cabalists]] of Void, and deliver four rings of [[Ilium|ilium]] which are passed to the custodian.
The [[Gift of the Dwindling Star|Gift of the Dwindling star]] is reliant on the current détente between [[The Empire|the Empire]] and the orcs of [[Otkodov]] continuing. In the event that the Thule and the Empire go to [[War|war]], it is likely this [[Bourse]] seat [[Will|will]] be one of the first [[Casualties|casualties]].
## [[The Bourse]] Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of ilium which is theirs to do with as they [[Will|will]]. If Gift of the Dwindling Star were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity|opportunity]] were to arise related to Gift of the Dwindling Star, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of Gift of the Dwindling Star comes with a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the [[Imperial Bourse]] as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of ilium
The Seat has control of a source of ilium which they receive directly. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 4 rings of ilium every season.
### Trade with warlocks
[[Red star]] Ilium
23 crowns1 ring of ilium
54 crowns2 rings of ilium
88 crowns3 rings of ilium
130 crowns4 rings of ilium
The Seat has access to a [[Ministry]] that allows them to trade food and goods to the warlock in exchange for quantities of Ilium at a set price. The title holder spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all ilium Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the [[Spring]] Equinox. Control of the Gift of the Dwindling Star is assigned to whichever Varushkan candidate receives the most support from Varushkan owners of mines and forests. Votes are recorded in private in conjunction with the civil servants who support the Bourse.
Custodianship of Gift of the Dwindling Star is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies or steps down. An [[Imperial Bourse]] seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
