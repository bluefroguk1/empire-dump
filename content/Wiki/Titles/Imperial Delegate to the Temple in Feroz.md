[[Imperial Delegate to the Temple in Feroz]] is ''not'' an [[Imperial Title]].
## Overview
''[[El oficial de enlace imperial con los sacerdotes de Balo y el toro negro|El oficial de enlace imperial con los sacerdotes de Balo y el Toro Negro]]'' or ''[[Delegato Imperiale presso i sacerdoti di Balo e del Toro Nero]]'' (depending who one asks - it translates roughly as Imperial intermediary/delegate to the priests of Balo and the Black Bull) is charged with maintaining good relations between Imperial citizens and the Asavean priests at the Temple of Balo and the Black Bull. As part of their work, they are able to purchase Asavean good at a set price.
The Temple of Balo and the Black Bull was completed shortly before the [[Spring]] Equinox 381YE. Construction was significantly over budget, and took half a year longer than expected, due to opposition from the [[Imperial Synod]].
The position of Delegate is ''not'' an [[Imperial Title]]; rather it represents access to a Campaign [[Resource|resource]].
## Responsibilities
The Delegate is responsible for maintaining the relationship between the [[Imperial Synod]], the people of Oran, and the priests and worshippers at the Temple of Balo and the Black Bull. For the most part, this is likely to involve smoothing over any conflicts, and dealing with any problems of [[Opportunities|opportunities]] related to the Temple.

### Point of Contact
The Asavean priesthood, both that local to [[Feroz]] and the temples of [[Asavea]], [[Will|will]] look to the Delegate to resolve any issues between the Asaveans and Imperial citizens, in conjunction with the [[Ambassador to Asavea]].

As a [[Ministry]], the title Imperial Delegate is able to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] at a set price. The Delegate spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with the [[Asavean Archipelago]] during the [[Winter]] Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost|cost]] to purchase goods via the ministry has increased by roughly a fifth.
## [[Appointment]]
The decision as to who [[Will|will]] serve as Delegate is in the hands of the Asavean priesthood. The speaker for the Asavean priests involved in this project, Hueva Jo√£on, has indicated that he would like the temporal power in the land where the temple is being built - specifically the [[Senator]] for [[Feroz]] - to [[Guide|guide]] the selection by presenting a candidate or candidates who would be open-minded and interested in cementing closer ties between the Archipelago and [[The Empire|the Empire]].
Anyone may hold the position of Delegate; as this is not an Imperial title, there is no requirement for the holder to be an Imperial citizen.
The Delegate can be removed at any time by the Asavean priesthood. The [[Imperial Senate|Imperial senate]] could close down the Temple of Balo and the Black Bull, making the title meaningless..
As this is not an Imperial title, the holder cannot be revoked, and would not lose access to the benefits of their position even if they were the subject of a [[Writ of Excommunication]].
## OOC Note
This position is not an Imperial title. A character could hold this position and still have an Imperial title. [[The Empire]] has little control over the position; in theory possession of the title and how it works is at the mercy of non-player [[Characters|characters]]. [[The Senate]] can effectively abrogate the title by shutting down the Temple of Balo and the Black Bull, but cannot amend its powers or responsibilities.
