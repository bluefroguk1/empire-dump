### Overview
The [[Hakima of Salt and Sand]] is an [[Imperial Title]] commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Winter]] 384YE. The Parador of Salt and Sand itself is built in town of Quzar, in [[Madruga]]
### Responsibilities
The [[Hakima]] of Salt and Sand is expected to represent the [[Hakima|hakima]] who visit the Parador of Salt and Sand. They are also responsible for ensuring the continued safety of those who visit Parador of Salt and Sand. If the Parador were to be threatened in any way it would be the responsibility of the Hakima to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Bounty of Crystals
The [[Hakima of Salt and Sand]] has access to a [[Ministry]]. The Hakima can purchase quantities of mana crystals from the hakima who visit, trade and debate at the Parador for set prices. The Hakima makes their decision how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.

## [[Appointment]]
The Hakima of Salt and Sand is appointed during the [[Summer]] Solstice. The Hakima is appointed by citizens of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] who control fleets. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only a Brass Coast character may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
SuitabilityThe Hakima of Salt and Sand is intended to be held by a hakima: the hakima who visit and trade at the Parador of Salt and Sand expect one of their own to be responsible for overseeing the Parador. If the title is held by a character who does not have the Hakima [[Archetype|archetype]] then the player must email admin@profounddecisions.co.uk to let us know.
## Expansion
While the Parador stands, it can be upgraded into a full [[College of Magic]] at any time at a [[Cost|cost]] of 55 wains of [[Mithril|mithril]] and 55 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], 55 wains of [[White granite|white granite]], and 330 crowns. The upgrade would require a [[Commission|commission]] slot and could be authorized by anyone with the power to [[Commission|commission]] a college of [[Magic|magic]]. The Hakima of Salt and Sand would retain the ability to purchase mana crystals from the Parador but gain the additional benefits provided by a [[College of Magic|college of magic]].
If the Parador were upgraded then the presence of so many hakima in Quzar would provide a crucial additional benefit. As long as the Hakima of Sand and Salt was seen to be a hakima in good standing, then the total seasonal upkeep of [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s colleges of [[Magic|magic]] would be reduced by 20 thrones a season.
