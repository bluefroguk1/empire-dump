## Overview
The [[Warden of the Trees and Hills]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a Varushkan citizen. Commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Autumn]] 383YE in response to an influx of refugees from newly [[Liberated|liberated]] [[Ossium]]. While the post was initially created to help find homes (and jobs) for former [[Druj]] slaves escorted to [[Karsk]] by the [[Thule]], the remit also in theory grants a certain degree of responsibility to protect the [[Prosperity|prosperity]] of the [[Territory]] as a whole. [[The Senate]] did not specify where precisely to build it - Ivarsgard, Kosti, Moresvah, and Veresk were all mooted - and after some consultation with the people of [[Karsk]] the Civil Service decided to lay the foundations in Ivarsgard.
## Responsibilities
The [[Warden]] is responsible for overseeing the merchant hall built to organise the influx of refugees from [[Ossium]]. With those newcomers settled, the [[Warden]] is also responsible for keeping the [[Prosperity|prosperity]] of [[Karsk]] as a whole, and charged with mediating any disputes between [[Mine|mine]] and [[Forest|forest]] owners in the territory. If the [[Warden]]'s Hall itself was ever directly threatened, the [[Warden]] would be responsible for dealing with those threats

As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Warden of the Trees and Hills]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] traded from the north at a set price. The [[Warden]] makes their decision on how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
==[[Appointment]]== 
This title is appointed during the [[Winter]] Solstice by Varushkans who control [[Forest]] and [[Mine]] personal resources. The larger the [[Forest|forest]] or [[Mine|mine]] an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only a Varushkan character may hold this title, but there is no requirement for them to be from [[Karsk]] (the title notionally involves encouraging trade throughout [[Varushka]]). They do not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As a title appointed through the Bourse, they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## Warden's Hall
The Hall itself is a three-storey [[White granite]] round tower with a black slate roof that stands in the town of Ivasrgard. It is remarkably secure; the windows have [[Mithril|mithril]]-reinforced shutters and the doors can be sealed with heavy oak bars - on the outside as well as the inside. Much of the early work of the Hall involved ensuring that none of the would-be settlers in [[Karsk]] were in fact monsters, so the ability to seal the tower quickly was seen as admirable. These days it mostly serves as a place for those with jobs to offer to post notices, or interview potential candidates. The Warden themselves has apartments on the top floor - serviceable rather than luxurious - for when they are in residence rather than out on the roads visiting farms, mines, and forests across Karsk.
