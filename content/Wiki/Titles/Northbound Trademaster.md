## Overview
The [[Northbound Trademaster]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a [[League]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the [[Autumn]] Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in Delev.
In the years since [[Skarsind]] was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the [[Wintermark]] focus was more on the routes through the passes into [[Hahnmark]] in the north-east. Over [[Winter]] 379YE, work began on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with Torfast Trading Post in [[Skarsind]] as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Temeschwar]]; merchant offices in the town of Delev in [[Karov]], and a brokerage in [[Hercynia]] known as the Treji [[Wayhouse]].
In [[Summer]] 381YE, in response to an [[Opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner joined the [[Northern trade network|Northern Trade Network]] bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire|the Empire]] remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire|the Empire]] remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. 
Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the forests of Metri threatened to sever [[Temeschwar]] from the network, leading to instability along the trade routes, reducing the options available to the Trademaster. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] were instructed to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  disruption to trade end.
During the Summer of 385YE, following the construction of the [[Temeschwar]]-[[Otkodov]] Mana Exchange, far more [[Traders|traders]] from [[Otkodov]] are making the trip to [[Temeschwar]] to sell their wares instead. At the same time the completion of the Iron Roads saw an influx of Varushkan trade goods passing through Delev Market in [[Karov]], providing additional [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to purchase goods.
## Responsibilities
The Trademaster is expected to keep the trade flowing along the roads that lead from [[Temeschwar]] north into [[Skarsind]] and south to the wider Empire. The close contact with the [[Traders|traders]] allows ample [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for the Trademaster to acquire supplies at bargain prices. To a lesser degree, the [[Northbound Trademaster]] can be seen as responsible for keeping an eye on trade opportunities across the northern Empire, and ensuring that League merchants are able to take advantage of them.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Northbound Trademaster]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] traded from the north at a set price. The Trademaster makes their decision on how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable [[Materials|materials]] easily through Delev market.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost|cost]] to purchase crystal mana has increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the crystal mana and the beggar's lye are ''both'' subject to [[Tariffs|tariffs]] when they cross the border with the [[Thule]] nation. The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to amend [[Tariffs|tariffs]] on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them free trade which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before [[Sanctions|sanctions]] were imposed.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice  by citizens of [[The League|the League]] who control [[Business]] personal resources. The larger the business an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only a League character may hold this title, but there is no requirement for them to be from Temeschwar (the title notionally represents opportunities for trade for the entire League). They do not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] appointed through the Bourse, they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
