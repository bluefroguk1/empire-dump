## Overview
The [[Basilisk of the Bourse]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] [[Create title Basilisk of the Bourse|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Autumn 383YE. The most significant [[Current Imperial titles#Imperial Bourse|Imperial Titles of the Bourse]] afford their incumbents access to rare and valuable resources - [[White granite|white granite]], [[Mithril]], [[Weirwood]] and [[Ilium]]. Whether by [[Auction of the Seats|success at auction]] or [[Tally of the Votes|by gathering sufficient votes]], these citizens have access to materials necessary for [[Commission|Senate commissions]], upgrading [[Resource#Personal Resource|personal resources]], and a variety of other projects. The wains or rings of ilium granted to these title holders are legally their property to dispense with as they wish. Although [[Imperial Constitution|constitutionally]] the holders of such titles cannot be subject to [[Revocation]], they are not immune to the scrutiny of the Synod, including the power of [[Inquisition]].
The title of ''Basilisk'' is an unusual one - the heraldic beast has a [[Highguard culture and customs#Icons and Artistry|strong association with Highguard]] and the Virtue of [[Vigilance]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Basilisk of the Bourse]] is expected to advise Bourse seat holders about the [[The Way|Way of Virtue]] and to offer them spiritual advice in their direct involvement in the economy of the Empire. They are also expected to oversee the use of Bourse resources and report to the Synod any concerns that Members of the Bourse are engaging in any activity that might [[Religious crime|constitute a religious crime]] so that, if necessary, an appropriate [[Sanction]] can be administered.
## Powers
### Inquisit Member of the Bourse
Once per summit, the Basilisk may call an [[Inquisition]] against any Bourse seat holder without the need for a vote in the Synod. This is in addition to any existing judgements they have raised normally. This use of the power may be escalated to a [[Condemnation]] just like any other [[Inquisition]]. To use this power, the Basilisk must still place a judgement before the Synod, but it is considered to pass automatically at the point it is presented.
Bourse seat holder
A Bourse seat holder is defined as the incumbent of any [[Imperial Title]] that receives an income of white granite, mithril, weirwood or ilium.
