## Overview
The [[Basilisk of the Bourse]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Autumn]] 383YE. The most significant Imperial Titles of [[The Bourse|the Bourse]] afford their incumbents access to rare and valuable resources - [[White granite|white granite]], [[Mithril]], [[Weirwood]] and [[Ilium]]. Whether by success at auction or by gathering sufficient votes, these citizens have access to [[Materials|materials]] necessary for [[Senate]] commissions, upgrading personal resources, and a variety of other projects. The wains or rings of [[Ilium|ilium]] granted to these title holders are legally their property to dispense with as they wish. Although constitutionally the holders of such titles cannot be subject to [[Revocation]], they are not immune to the [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] of [[The Synod|the Synod]], including the power of [[Inquisition]].
The title of ''Basilisk'' is an unusual one - the heraldic beast has a strong association with [[Highguard]] and the Virtue of [[Vigilance]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Basilisk of the Bourse]] is expected to advise [[Bourse]] seat holders about [[The Way|the Way]] of Virtue and to offer them spiritual advice in their direct involvement in the economy of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. They are also expected to oversee the use of Bourse resources and report to the [[Synod]] any concerns that Members of the Bourse are engaging in any activity that might constitute a [[Religious crime|religious crime]] so that, if necessary, an appropriate [[Sanction]] can be administered.
## Powers
### Inquisit Member of the Bourse
Once per summit, the Basilisk may call an [[Inquisition]] against any Bourse seat holder without the need for a vote in the Synod. This is in addition to any existing judgements they have raised normally. This use of the power may be escalated to a [[Condemnation]] just like any other Inquisition. To use this power, the Basilisk must still place a [[Judgement|judgement]] before the Synod, but it is considered to pass automatically at the point it is presented.
Bourse seat holder
A Bourse seat holder is defined as the incumbent of any [[Imperial Title]] that receives an income of [[White granite|white granite]], [[Mithril|mithril]], [[Weirwood|weirwood]] or ilium. For reasons thought to go back to the formation of the Bourse under [[Emperor Giovanni]], this also includes the [[Master of the Imperial Mint]], and would include any other title that explicitly granted a ''seat'' on the [[Imperial Bourse]].
## [[Appointment]]
The Basilisk is appointed during the [[Winter]] Solstice. The are chosen with a [[Judgement]] of [[Appointment]] by the [[Assembly]] of the Nine. 
The title can be held by any Imperial citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] and the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
