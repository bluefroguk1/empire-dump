## Crimson Drummers of Madruga
On the eastern side of the Jade Range there there is clear stream that flow down from the mountains to the warm and sandy soil of Torres. Here live a group of Freeborn who cultivate alkanet; its red-maroon roots used to give colour to wines, to oils, and to varnishes.
The Crimson Drummers use this oil to care for their drums, which they use in celebration of the Way. Their celebrations involve feasting and dancing to the rhythms provided by the drummers - their hands stained bright crimson by the oils they use.
