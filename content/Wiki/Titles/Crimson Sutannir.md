## [[Appointment]]
The [[Crimson Sutannir]] is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the [[Freeborn]] [[Assembly]]. . 
The title can be held by any Freeborn citizen. The [[Sutannir]] has [[Tenure|tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Crimson Drummers of [[Madruga]]
On the eastern side of the Jade Range there there is clear stream that flow down from the mountains to the warm and sandy soil of Torres. Here live a group of Freeborn who cultivate alkanet; its red-maroon roots used to give colour to wines, to oils, and to varnishes.
The Crimson Drummers use this oil to care for their drums, which they use in celebration of [[The Way|the Way]]. Their celebrations involve feasting and dancing to the rhythms provided by the drummers - their hands stained bright crimson by the oils they use.
