## Overview
Custodianship of Brock's Toll is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to either a Marcher or Dawnish citizen. It is a National position, appointed through a unique method, granting custodianship of a [[Sinecure]] in a [[Navarr]] [[Territory]].
## Responsibilities
The title holder is expected to ensure that Brock's Bridge remains open to Dawnish and Marcher yeofolk alike. The actual job of maintaining the bridge falls to civil servants and local labourers, the majority of them [[Navarr]]. They charge a small toll for yeofolk of whichever nation does ''not'' control the bridge, which both provides the [[Sinecure]] for the title holder, and goes toward the irregular repairs on the bridge and the paths leading to it.
## Powers
### Small Income
As a [[Sinecure|sinecure]], Brock's Toll provides an income drawn from the tolls paid by yeofolk using the bridge.
The holder of the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] receives 16 crowns and 4 rings in income each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The title is selected by a tourney during the [[Summer]] Solstice. Five Marcher yeomen face five Dawnish yeofolk in a brutal, non-lethal [[Fight|fight]] with the last competitor standing claiming the proceeds of Brock's Toll in the coming year.
The title can only be held by a Marcher, or by a Dawnish yeofolk. In the event that a Dawnish yeofolk holder of the title becomes a noble, they are expected to immediately surrender the title.
The title is appointed annually. The Keeper of Brock's Toll can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Assembly of the Nine]], and by the [[National Assembly]] of either [[The Marches|the Marches]] or [[Dawn]], depending on the [[Nationality|nationality]] of the title holder.
## Brock's Toll
Brock's Toll is a famous toll bridge situated in Greenfalls, roughly halfway between [[Dawn]] and [[The Marches|the Marches]], and historically claimed by both. While it isn't much used by wealthy merchants or nobles, the road that this bridge lies on carries most of the agricultural traffic between [[Dawn]] and the [[Marches]]. Traditionally, the operator of the Toll was allowed to claim one sack from each cart's load but in 295YE this was adjusted in favour of a small toll paid by the yeofolk of whichever nation did ''not'' win the tourney.
The bridge is so old that when it was first constructed [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] still controlled most of [[Miaren]].  In the early days of [[The Empire|the Empire]] this site changed hands between the two nations several times, often with violence. Even when Earls and Stewards forbade their people to [[Fight|fight]], rowdy yeofolk would often take matters into their own hands and the [[Navarr]] soon became sick of breaking up scuffles over ownership.
Eventually the [[Imperial Senate]] took matters into their own hand and decreed that ownership of the Toll would be decided by an annual competition of arms between the yeofolk who were so eager to [[Fight|fight]]. In time this evolved into the modern practice of the ''Brock's Buffet'' - a brutal (nonlethal) five-aside melee with only one winner left standing to claim ownership for the coming year.
