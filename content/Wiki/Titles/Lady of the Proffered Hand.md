## House of the Proffered Hand
"House" is something of a misnomer, representing a small estate. Situated near Caer Faucon, a small village in southern [[Astolat]] not far from the border with [[Casinea]], it is a peaceful place in a sheltered valley, employing many of the village residents and helping to rejuvenate the local economy, devastated by losses suffered in recent military campaigns. The House of the Proffered Hand made use of an abandoned manor house and several smallholdings which had fallen into [[Ruin|ruin]]. The grounds also contain many tents and pavilions, set up to provide temporary accommodation and medical facilities for those who need them.
Central to the structure is a beautiful chapel, dedicated to the Seven Virtues, that serves both as a place of meditation and study of the virtues, and as a place to educate those unfamiliar with [[The Way|the Way]]. It is a popular destination for pilgrims, some of whom chose to volunteer to support the House's mission. 
The estate includes extensive gardens, both ornamental and those growing produce to feed the residents, tended by both staff and those in recovery. There is also a hospital building for treating those who arrive badly hurt, or who suffer from ongoing chronic conditions caused by captivity and torture.
