## Overview
The Overseer of the Westbound Road is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a Varushkan citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]], and was the last of the four original components completed.
In the years since [[Skarsind]] was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the [[Wintermark]] focus was more on the routes through the passes into [[Hahnmark]] in the north-east. Over [[Winter]] 379YE, work began on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with Torfast Trading Post in [[Skarsind]] as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in Delev, the Temeschwari [[Guilds|guilds]]  and the Treji [[Wayhouse]].
In [[Summer]] 381YE, in response to an [[Opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner joined the [[Northern trade network|Northern Trade Network]] bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire|the Empire]] remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. Following the [[Autumn]] Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the forests of Metri threatened to sever [[Temeschwar]] from the network, leading to instability along the trade routes, reducing the options available to the Overseer. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] were instructed to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  disruption to trade end.
Following the construction of the [[Temeschwar]]-[[Otkodov]] Mana Exchange far more [[Traders|traders]] from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead.
## Responsibilities
The Overseer is expected to keep the trade flowing along the roads that lead from Delev west into Skarsind and east to the rest of [[Varushka]] and [[Dawn]]. The close contact with the [[Traders|traders]] allows ample [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for the Overseer to acquire supplies at bargain prices - metals from Skarsind and Temeschwar, and [[Herbs|herbs]] from [[Hercynia]]. To a lesser degree, the Overseer can be seen as responsible for keeping an eye on trade [[Opportunities|opportunities]] across the northern Empire, and ensuring that Varushkan merchants are properly positioned to take advantage of them.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of Overseer of the Westbound Road allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] traded from the north at a set price. The Overseer makes their decision on how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
Delev welcomes Thule merchants from Otkodov, as well as Imperial merchants. As a consequence, the overseer has not one but ''two'' streams from which they can purchase material. The Overseer can spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 17 crowns on one, and 11 measures on the other.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with Otkodov during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost|cost]] to purchase crystal mana has increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the crystal mana and the [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] are ''both'' subject to [[Tariffs|tariffs]] when they cross the border with the Thule nation. The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to amend [[Tariffs|tariffs]] on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them free trade which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before [[Sanctions|sanctions]] were imposed.
==[[Appointment]]== 
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice by Varushkans who control [[Forest]] and [[Mine]] personal resources. The larger the [[Forest|forest]] or [[Mine|mine]] an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only a Varushkan character may hold this title, but there is no requirement for them to be from Delev (the title notionally involves encouraging trade throughout [[Varushka]]). They do not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As a title appointed through the Bourse, they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
