The Iron Roundtower was constructed by announcement of the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] during the [[Summer]] Solstice 383YE, following an [[Opportunity]] presented during the [[Spring]] Equinox of the same year. Construction was completed shortly before the [[Autumn]] Equinox 383YE.
## Responsibilities
