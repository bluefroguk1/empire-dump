## Overview
The [[Champion of Courage]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that was created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Summer]] 382YE. The title confers custodianship of the artifact Pilgrim's Shield known as ''Torchbrand''.
## Responsibilities
The Champion of [[Courage]] is intended to serve as an inspiration to the Pilgrims of the faith and laity as to what it means to be courageous, particularly in a military context. Historically the bearers of Torchbrand formed, along with the bearers of the other Pilgrims shield, the “Seven Pilgrims” band.
## Powers
### Regalia of the [[Champion of Courage]]
The Champion of [[Courage]] bears ''Torchbrand'', the unique Pilgrim's Shield. If the [[Champion of Courage]] loses their position, then the item must be given to the new Champion with all haste. The Champion is encouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe, and is expected to do everything within their power to recover it if it is lost.
## [[Appointment]]
The Champion of [[Courage]] is chosen every [[Autumn]] Equinox by a [[Judgement]] of [[Appointment]] by the [[Assembly]] of [[Courage]].
Any Imperial citizen may hold this title. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Courage]] [[Assembly|assembly]], and the [[Assembly of the Nine]].

## [[History]]
The shield Torchbrand was created by Ezkiah the [[Benefactor]], greatest smith of the Highborn along with six other shields. Each was gifted to a different hero, forming a company known as the “Seven Pilgrims”. 
Torchbrand was first carried by Kaya of Thornhaven, a [[Navarr]] of [[Briar]] [[Lineage]]. Passed from Champion to Champion, or selected by the priests of Courage when this was not possible, it remained an enduring inspiration to the faithful of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. 
At the battle of [[Reikos]] in 367 YE the Seven Pilgrims of the [[Day|day]] charged an entire [[Druj]] army on their own, allowing the outmatched Imperial forces time to quit the field in good order. Torchbrand was lost along with the other six shields, but recovered three years later. Rumour says that it was retrieved following a tournament with heralds of the Summer [[Realm]] by nobles of House Orzel of [[Dawn]]. The Courage [[Assembly]] demanded the return of the shield, but agreed to select a member of House Orzel as Champion. 
Regardless of this alleged agreement, the shield came into the possession of Horsa Tyshalt of [[Wintermark]]. A dispute over the shield ensued. In a [[Statement of Principle]] raised by Nina of Cantiarch's Hold the [[Assembly]] stated “The Courage Assembly [[Will|will]] decide the fate of the Courage Shield Torchbrand” (Statement of Primciple, Autumn 381, [[Judgement]] 65, Upheld 104 - 0 ). In Summer 382 then [[Cardinal]] Jorma Steelhail retrieved the shield, and [[The Senate|the Senate]] agreed to create the title of [[Champion of Courage]].
Historically the Shield was passed from Champion to Champion; [[The Synod|the Synod]] has ended this tradition through the creation of a formal title. It is likely that the other assemblies [[Will|will]] follow suit should their namesake shields ever be recovered.
