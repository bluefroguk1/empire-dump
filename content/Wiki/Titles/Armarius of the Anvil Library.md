## Anvil Library Scriptorium
The Anvil Library Scriptorium stands on the site of a much-expanded wayhouse in Foracci, along the trods from Rodez to Casinea. The Scriptorium continues to act as a wayhouse for those travelling to and from Anvil, but also for guest lecturers and researchers at the Library and associated Seminary, training priests based on a programme inspired by the works of Avigliana di Sarvos. 
Due to its role in the fight against the Whisper Gallery the Scriptorium is part of a well-defended compound, reminiscent of a Highguard chapterhouse. As well as the wayhouse and the Seminary, the walls also surround the Anvil Library Press and its associated paper- and ink-making facilities, all emblazoned with the names of the individuals and organizations who helped sponsor the Scriptorium into existence.
