## Overview
The [[Armarius of the Anvil Library]] is an [[Imperial Title]] announced by ''Claus Friedrich von [[Holberg]]'', as [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] in [[Spring]] 385YE. 
## Responsibilities
The Armarius of the [[Anvil]] Library has no particular responsibilities; they are recognised as having votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] and they receive a bounty of [[Liao]] from the civil service. If the [[Anvil]] Library Scriptorium were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Armarius to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### A Portion of [[Liao]]
The [[Sinecure|sinecure]] provides 7 doses of [[Liao]] to the Armarius each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in [[The Synod|the Synod]]
The Armarius may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 14 votes in [[Synod]] affairs (or an additional 14 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any [[Assembly|assembly]] for which they are eligible. 
## [[Anvil]] Library Scriptorium
The [[Anvil]] Library Scriptorium stands on the site of a much-expanded [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]] in Foracci, along the [[Trods|trods]] from Rodez to [[Casinea]]. The Scriptorium continues to act as a [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]] for those travelling to and from [[Anvil]], but also for guest lecturers and researchers at [[The Library|the Library]] and associated Seminary, training priests based on a programme inspired by the works of [[Avigliana di Sarvos]]. 
Due to its role in the [[Fight|fight]] against the [[Whisper Gallery]] the Scriptorium is part of a well-defended compound, reminiscent of a [[Highguard]] chapterhouse. As well as the [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]] and the Seminary, the walls also surround the Anvil Library Press and its associated paper- and ink-making facilities, all emblazoned with the names of the individuals and organizations who helped sponsor the Scriptorium into existence.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Armarius of the Anvil Library]] is a virtue position which is appointed by [[Judgement]] of the [[Wisdom]] [[Assembly|assembly]]. Any Imperial citizen may hold the title.
The Armarius has [[Tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Assembly]] of [[Wisdom]], and the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
