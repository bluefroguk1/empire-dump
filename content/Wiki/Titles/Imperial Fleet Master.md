## Overview
The [[Imperial Fleet Master]] is an [[Imperial Title]] first [[Create title of Admiral|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 378YE, then [[Amend powers of the Imperial Admiral|amended]] in Spring 380YE, with the responsibility to coordinate with [[Fleet|Fleet]] owners to support Imperial [[Imperial navy|navies]].
The last time the Empire had significant naval strength was during the reign of [[Emperor Barabbas]]. The majority of the ''Barabbine fleet'' was destroyed when it encountered a supernaturally intense storm two days south of Joharra. This resulted in the first, biggest – and most expensive – naval disaster of Imperial history and goes some way toward explaining why modern Imperial fleets are mercantile, rather than military, concerns. With the first launching of [[The Brass Coast military concerns#The Freeborn Storm|The Freeborn Storm]] just before the Winter Solstice 379YE, the Senate chose to redefine the title of 'Imperial Admiral' into the [[Imperial Fleet Master]], opting for the title to focus on supporting navies rather than raiding barbarians. The title was further [[Amend powers of Imperial Fleet Master|amended]] during the Summer Solstice 383YE, in part as a response to a proposal from the [[Grendel]] [[Orc|orcs]] that the Fleet Master be [[Long walk home#Grendel|appointed ambassador to the Broken Shore]] in recognition of the Audacity, Ambition, and Cunning of then-title holder Esteban i Del Rio Blanco i Guerra. During the Autumn Equinox 384YE the Senate passed a [[384YE Autumn Equinox Senate sessions#Create Ambassador to the Grendel|motion]] creating the position of [[Ambassador to the Grendel]] which also removed the mercantile support and authority from the Fleet Master
