## Overview
The [[Imperial Fleet Master]] is an [[Imperial Title]] first created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Spring]] 378YE, then amended in Spring 380YE, with the responsibility to coordinate with [[Fleet]] owners to support Imperial navies.
The last time [[The Empire|the Empire]] had significant naval strength was during the reign of [[Emperor Barabbas]]. The majority of the ''Barabbine [[Fleet|fleet]]'' was destroyed when it encountered a supernaturally intense storm two days south of Joharra. This resulted in the first, biggest – and most expensive – naval disaster of [[Imperial history]] and goes some way toward explaining why modern Imperial fleets are mercantile, rather than military, concerns. With the first launching of The [[Freeborn Storm]] just before the [[Winter]] Solstice 379YE, [[The Senate|the Senate]] chose to redefine the title of 'Imperial Admiral' into the [[Imperial Fleet Master]], opting for the title to focus on supporting navies rather than raiding [[Barbarians|barbarians]]. The title was further amended during the [[Summer]] Solstice 383YE, in part as a response to a proposal from the [[Grendel]] orcs that the Fleet Master be appointed [[Ambassador|ambassador]] to the Broken Shore in [[Recognition|recognition]] of the Audacity, [[Ambition]], and Cunning of then-title holder Esteban i Del Rio Blanco i [[Guerra]]. During the [[Autumn]] Equinox 384YE the [[Senate]] passed a motion creating the position of [[Ambassador to the Grendel]] which also removed the mercantile support and authority from the Fleet Master
