## Overview
The [[Pride]] of Ikka's Tears is located in [[Suaq]] Fount in the [[Wintermark]] [[Territory]] of [[Sermersuaq]]. Custodianship of the [[Pride]] of Ikka's Tears grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Mithril|mithril]].
## The [[Resource]]
The Pride of Ikka's Tears was discovered in [[Winter]] 379YE by chance by a civil servant exploring the Face of Ikka. Peter of Hintown and his companions were performing a follow-up investigation of the isolated site after their discovery of the ruined [[Gildenheim runeforge|Gildenheim Runeforge]]. The [[Imperial Senate]] determined to make the best use of the [[Mithril|mithril]] vein the expedition had discovered, and over the next nine months work continued despite a bitter winter and the constant threat of [[Jotun]] invasion. 
The [[Mine|mine]] is named in commemoration of the Battle of Ikka's Tears, a vicious confrontation between the [[Heroes|heroes]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]] and a [[Thule]] expeditionary force that left dozens dead on the plains below the glacier. It may be possible to expand the workings even further, but only the presence of a significant number of skilled miners [[Will|will]] be able to determine exactly how rich this mithril find might potentially be. Further prospecting may be a little risky, however. For now, the [[Mine|mine]] workings are relatively shallow and mostly delve into the stone beneath the ancient glacier - while carefully avoiding the allegedly haunted tunnels that riddle the great wall of slowly moving ice. Expansion may prove lucrative in terms of mithril, but local [[Suaq]] [[Mystics|mystics]] warn against disturbing the ancient Face of Ikka unnecessarily.
For the moment the worst threat the miners there have had to deal with are the dire beasts of the northern wastes - mostly inquisitive dire penguins and grumpy dire walrus - along with the occasional sighting of a prowling glacier cat or hungry winter bear. There are two potentially more serious problems with this seat which might need to be addressed in the coming years. 
Firstly, its proximity to [[Jotun]] and [[Thule]] lands cannot be understated. [[The Empire]] is already at [[War|war]] with the Jotun, and in the event of a renewal of hostilities with the Thule it would come under immediate threat. Peter of Hintown and his Suaq advisor, the [[Architect|architect]] Ana, have both sent strongly worded recommendations that the Empire consider building a [[Fortification]] in the Suaq Fount to help protect the new mithril resource (and in Peter's case, the historical artefacts of the Face of Ikka).
Secondly, the mine stands on the very northern edge of the Empire in an area known for troll ruins and exotic artefacts. If any horror emerged from Tsirku, or from within the glacier, then the mithril mine would almost certainly be straight in its path. During the [[Spring]] Equinox 382YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] dispatched prospectors to evaluate the workings and determine if it would be possible to expand the production. Their findings were rendered moot when the Jotun conquered [[Sermersuaq]] in 382YE.
Following the [[Autumn]] Equinox 383YE, the Empire launched a lightning raid deep into Sermersuaq to disrupt Jotun control of the mithril mine. The raid was a great success, managing to collapse parts of the workings and force the orcs to divert resources to reopening them again. After the northern [[Wintermark]] territory was [[Liberated|liberated]], the mine was once again allocated by [[The Senate|the Senate]] as a National seat.
The Imperial [[Senate]] commissioned an expansion of the mine during the Winter Solstice 385YE.
## [[The Bourse]] Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of mithril which is theirs to do with as they [[Will|will]]. If the Pride of Ikka's Tears were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Pride of Ikka's Tears, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the [[Bourse]]
Custodianship of the Pride of Ikka's Tears comes with a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of mithril
The Seat has control of a source of mithril and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 22 Imperial wains of mithril every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all mithril Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the Autumn Equinox. Control of the Pride of Ikka's Tears is assigned to whichever Wintermark candidate receives the most support from Wintermark owners of military units. Votes are recorded in private in conjunction with the civil servants who support the Bourse.
Custodianship of the Pride of Ikka's Tears is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
