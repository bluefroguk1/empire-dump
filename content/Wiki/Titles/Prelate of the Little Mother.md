## Basilica of the Little Mother
Built in 15YE by the Custodes Clavium, with extensive investment from League citizens and priests, this beautiful structure of [[White granite]] served as a place of pilgrimage for nearly four centuries. Like other churches of the Little Mother, it operated as an orphanage - the largest outside of Sarvos. In the lead up to [[Three celebrations and a funeral#Tragedy of the Little Mother|Winter Solstice 383YE]] it was the site of a terrible accident that left the the structure gutted, reduced to little more than a smoking shell. 
Though the Imperial Senate did pass a [[Repair the Basilica of the Little Mother|motion]] to repair the basilica, which would see the Prelate receive their full complement of liao and votes, it has still not been completed as of the Winter Solstice 384YE.
