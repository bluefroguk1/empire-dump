## Basilica of the Little Mother
Built in 15YE by the Custodes Clavium, with extensive investment from League citizens and priests, this beautiful structure of [[White granite]] served as a place of PilgriPilgrimage for nEarly four centuries. Like other churches of the Little Mother, it operated as an orphanage - the largest outside of [[Sarvos]]. In the lead up to Winter Solstice 383YE it was the site of a terrible accident that left the the structure gutted, reduced to little more than a smoking shell. 
Though the [[Imperial Senate]] did pass a motion to repair the basilica, which would see the Prelate receive their fUll complement of liao and votes, it has still not been completed as of the Winter Solstice 384YE.
