## Overview
Constructed [[Construct Root and Stem Apothecarium|by order]] of the [[Imperial Senate]], work was completed on this set of dedicated docks shortly before the Summer Solstice 383YE. The Kruidenkenner are [[Sarcophan Delves|Sarcophan]] masters of herb lore and the [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|apothecary]] arts, eager to establish a presence in the Empire; much of the initial negotiation was overseen by the [[Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Master of the Root and Stem]] is expected to oversee the trade of herbs between the Sarcophan guild and the Empire. If the [[#The Kruidenkenner Magazijn|Kruidenkenner ''magazijn'']] were ever directly threatened, the master would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity]] related to the docks. The continued operation of the ''magazijn'', and thus the ministry, requires that relations between the Empire and Sarcophan remain cordial - the master has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Master of the Root and Stem]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of [[Bladeroot]] at a set price. The master spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice by citizens of the Marches who control [[Farm]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the farm an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only a Marcher character may hold the title.  As a title in the Bourse, they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]]
## The Kruidenkenner Magazijn
Built in Meade, in [[Mitwold#Meade March|Meade March]], in the territory of [[Mitwold]], the Kruidenkenner ''magazijn'' is a sturdy weirwood warehouse in the Sarcophan style, around which cluster a number of smaller buildings - a residence for the visiting merchants and a small office for overseeing day-to-day business. While the master receives reasonable deals on the purchase of bladeroot, the kruidenkenner also use it as a base of operations for their own trades within Imperial borders - buying and selling herbs, potions, and drugs in Mitwold and much of the western Empire.
The KruidenkennerThese expert Sarcophan herbalists and apothecaries have made some additional agreements with the Imperial [[Ambassador]] that are worth reiterating. They have agreed that they will not use their Imperial warehouse to trade with any nation the Empire is at war with, nor trade goods purchased in the Empire to ports belonging to such people. They understand that this will restrict them from trading with the [[Grendel]], but have little contact with other barbarian [[Orc]] nations. 
They have received assurances in return that the Empire agrees to give them a "grace period" of one season between declaring war on someone and the expectation they will cease trading. They have also made it clear that they reserve the right to end the arrangement with the Empire - giving up their trade enclave - with a season's notice, should they wish to do so.
In both cases it would be the responsibility of the [[Master of the Root and Stem]] (or at a pinch the [[Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves]]) to deal with such developments. A suitably worded [[Call Winged Messenger|winged messenger]] to ''Bedelaar Huisbaas Annike, The Tower of Crows, Sarcophan, Sarcophan Delves ''would be sufficient to discharge this obligation.
