## Overview
Constructed by order of the [[Imperial Senate]], work was completed on this set of dedicated docks shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice 383YE. The Kruidenkenner are Sarcophan masters of [[Herb|herb]] lore and the [[Apothecary|apothecary]] arts, eager to establish a presence in [[The Empire|the Empire]]; much of the initial negotiation was overseen by the [[Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Master of the Root and Stem]] is expected to oversee the trade of [[Herbs|herbs]] between the Sarcophan [[Guild|guild]] and [[The Empire|the Empire]]. If the Kruidenkenner ''magazijn'' were ever directly threatened, the master would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity]] related to the docks. The continued operation of the ''magazijn'', and thus the [[Ministry|ministry]], requires that relations between [[The Empire|the Empire]] and Sarcophan remain cordial - the master has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Master of the Root and Stem]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of [[Bladeroot]] at a set price. The master spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice by citizens of [[The Marches|the Marches]] who control [[Farm]] personal resources. The larger the [[Farm|farm]] an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only a Marcher character may hold the title.  As a title in the [[Bourse]], they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]]
## The Kruidenkenner Magazijn
Built in Meade, in Meade March, in the [[Territory|territory]] of [[Mitwold]], the Kruidenkenner ''magazijn'' is a sturdy [[Weirwood|weirwood]] warehouse in the Sarcophan style, around which cluster a number of smaller buildings - a residence for the visiting merchants and a small office for overseeing [[Day|day]]-to-day [[Business|business]]. While the master receives reasonable deals on the purchase of bladeroot, the kruidenkenner also use it as a base of operations for their own trades within Imperial borders - buying and selling herbs, potions, and drugs in [[Mitwold]] and much of the western Empire.
The KruidenkennerThese expert Sarcophan herbalists and apothecaries have made some additional agreements with the Imperial [[Ambassador]] that are [[Worth|worth]] reiterating. They have agreed that they [[Will|will]] not use their Imperial warehouse to trade with any nation [[The Empire|the Empire]] is at [[War|war]] with, nor trade goods purchased in [[The Empire|the Empire]] to ports belonging to such people. They understand that this [[Will|will]] restrict them from trading with the [[Grendel]], but have little contact with other [[Barbarian|barbarian]] [[Imperial Orcs]] nations. 
They have received assurances in return that the Empire agrees to give them a "grace period" of one season between declaring [[War|war]] on someone and the expectation they [[Will|will]] cease trading. They have also made it clear that they reserve the right to end the arrangement with the Empire - giving up their trade enclave - with a season's notice, should they wish to do so.
In both cases it would be the responsibility of the [[Master of the Root and Stem]] (or at a pinch the [[Ambassador]] to the [[Sarcophan Delves]]) to deal with such developments. A suitably worded winged messenger to ''Bedelaar Huisbaas Annike, The Tower of Crows, Sarcophan, [[Sarcophan Delves]] ''would be sufficient to discharge this obligation.
