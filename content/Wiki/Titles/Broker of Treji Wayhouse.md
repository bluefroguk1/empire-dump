## Overview
The [[Broker of Treji Wayhouse]] is an [[Imperial Title]]  aWarded to a [[Navarr]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in Delev.
In the years since [[Skarsind]] was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the [[Wintermark]] focus was more on the routes through the passes into [[Hahnmark]] in the north-east. Over Winter 379YE, work began on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with Torfast Trading Post in Skarsind as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Temeschwar]] and [[Karov]].
In Summer 381YE, in response to an Opportunity offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner joined the Northern Trade Network bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire]] remains at peace with the Thule. Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the Forests of Metri threatened to sever Temeschwar from the network, leading to instability along the trade routes, reducing the options available to the Broker. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] were instructed to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  disruption to trade end.
During the Summer of 385YE, following the construction of the Temeschwar-Otkodov Mana Exchange far more traders from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead. The completion of the Iron Roads saw an influx of Varushkan trade goods passing through Delev Market in Karov, providing additional opportunities to purchase goods.
## Responsibilities
The Broker is expected to keep the trade flowing along the roads that lead from Skarsind west through [[Hercynia]] and to the rest of the Empire. The close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Broker to acquire supplies at bargain prices from merchants heading both to and from Skarsind.

As a Ministry, the title of Broker of Treji [[Wayhouse]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials]] at a set price. The Broker makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable materials easily through Delev market.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions]] on trade with Otkodov during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost]] to purchase crystal mana has increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the crystal mana and the dragonbone are ''both'' subject to [[Tariffs]] when they cross the border with the Thule nation. The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to aMend tariffs on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them free trade which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before sanctions were imposed.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice by Navarr who control [[Herb garden]] personal resources. The larger the Herb garden an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse.
