## Overview
The [[Steward of the [[Tassato]] Mana Exchange]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a League citizen. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Steward]] is responsible for ensuring that all business taking place at the Tassato Mana Exchange is above board, although the actual day-to-day running of the Exchange is handled by officers who are well paid for their work. In the event that the Exchange was threatened, they would be expected to deal with those threats; they might also be called on to make decisions about the broad policies of the Exchange such as whether certain nations or individuals should be prevented from trading, and so on. In return, the agents of the Exchange appraise the Steward of opportunities to purchase crystal mana at bargain prices.

The Tassato Mana Exchange is a Ministry. The Steward can purchase quantities of crystal mana at a set price. The Steward makes their decision how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The [[Steward of the [[Sarvos]] Mana Exchange]] is appointed during the Summer Solstice each year by unanimous decision of the Senators of [[The League]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a citizen of the League. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the League National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## Tassato Mana Exchange
The Mana Exchange was Commissioned by Cesare Sanguineo Rezia Di Tassato of the Gilded Horn Carta during the Winter Solstice 379YE, and work completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 380YE. The physical structure occupies two connected, heavily , three-storey buildings in Tassato Mestra overlooking the river. It has its own private dock, and several heavily reinforced sub-levels with [[Mithril]]-infused wards against scrying and intrusion. The business of the Mana Exchange is the sale and purchase of crystal mana. While many of the customers are League citizens, the Exchange is open to customers from across [[The Empire]] and beyond. There has already been some interest from Jarmish and Axou mana traders.
Despite Early concerns about a mana exchange in Tassato (it opened during the mana shortage of Spring 380YE), the Exchange has been greeted with near universal approval by several guilds including both the proMinent DeSousa Crystal Traders and their bitter rivals the DeMosca House of Mana.
Since Spring 381YE, a number of traders from the [[Principalities of Jarm]] have been using the Mana Exchange to engage in lucrative trade with the Empire. Operating form their lodge in Enterio, they significantly increased the volume of mana going through the ministry. The Jarmish traders have left the lodge following the Imperial Senate placing an embargo on the Principalities of Jarm.
Following the decision of the Imperial Senate in Spring 384YE, the exchange was expanded slightly to allow the civil service to increase the amount of mana they could purchase on behalf off the Grandmasters of the [[Imperial Conclave]].
