## Overview
The [[Champion of Loyalty]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that was created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Winter]] 383YE. The title confers custodianship of the artefact Pilgrim's Shield known as ''Oath-Heart''.
## Responsibilities
The Champion of [[Loyalty]] is intended to serve as an inspiration to the Pilgrims of the faith and laity as to what it means to be loyal, particularly in a military context. They are also charged with bearing and protecting the shield known as ''Oath-Heart''. Historically the bearers of ''Oath-Heart'' formed, along with the bearers of the other Pilgrims shield, the “Seven Pilgrims” band. 
## Powers
### Regalia of the [[Champion of Loyalty]]
The Champion of [[Loyalty]] bears ''Oath-Heart'', the unique Pilgrim's Shield. If the [[Champion of Loyalty]] loses their position, then the item must be given to the new Champion with all haste. The Champion is encouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe, and is expected to do everything within their power to recover it if it is lost.
''Oath-Heart'' was recovered by Imperial [[Heroes|heroes]] at a conjunction at the [[Summer]] Solstice 384YE, and was formally vested as regalia by the then-Champion, Goran Sokolov Zaytsev, at the Winter Solstice 384YE.
## [[Appointment]]
The Champion of [[Loyalty]] is chosen every Winter Solstice by a [[Judgement]] of [[Appointment]] by the [[Assembly]] of [[Loyalty]].
Any Imperial citizen may hold this title. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Loyalty]] [[Assembly]], and the [[Assembly of the Nine]].

## [[History]]
The shield ''Oath-Heart'' was created by Ezkiah the [[Benefactor]], greatest smith of the Highborn along with six other shields. Each was gifted to a different hero, forming a company known as the “Seven Pilgrims”. 
''Oath-Heart'' was first carried by Drumlin the Sworn, a thrice-geased Winterfolk. Passed from Champion to Champion, or selected by the priests of Loyalty when this was not possible, it remained an enduring inspiration to the faithful of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. 
At the battle of [[Reikos]] in 367 YE the Seven Pilgrims of the [[Day|day]] charged an entire [[Druj]] army on their own, allowing the outmatched Imperial forces time to quit the field in good order. ''Oath-Heart'' was lost along with the other six shields.
Historically the Shield was passed from Champion to Champion; [[The Synod|the Synod]] has ended this tradition through the creation of a formal title, following the example set by the creation of the [[Champion of Courage]].
