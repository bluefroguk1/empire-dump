## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Pelican Tower]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] of [[The League|the League]] created following an announcement during the [[Spring]] Equinox 384YE by Achille di [[Sarvos]], [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]]. The construction was completed shortly before the 384YE [[Summer]] Solstice.
## Responsibilities
The Custodian has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of mana crystals from Pelican Tower. If the Tower were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Custodian to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any [[Opportunity]] relating to the Tower presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of it.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Custodian receives an income of 9 mana crystals each season from the Pelican Tower.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Custodian of the Pelican Tower]] is selected by unanimous decision of the [[The League]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any [[League]] citizen. The Custodian has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the League [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Pelican Tower
Upstream from Rodez and along the banks of the tranquil Gancio, the Pelican Tower stands like a lonely lighthouse, to [[Guide|guide]] travellers by both boat and road. The white-washed walls gleam in the sunlight and can be seen from amongst the vineyards and olive groves of northern [[Sarvos]]. Built on a natural ley line, the [[Mithril|mithril]] in the tower serves as a potent focus for the formation of mana crystals. The tower also currently serves as the base of operations for the Carta Bellamarina, one of the many [[Guilds|guilds]] of [[Caricomare]]. Carved above the entrance is the crest of the Bellamarina; a white pelican on a shield of burgundy and turquoise, representing the Carta’s motto “By Blood and Brine”. 
The ground floor hosts a spacious meeting place for the Carta, filled with memorabilia from its past, leaving visitors in no doubt that of their prowess in chandlery, sailmaking, ironwork, ropemaking and their [[History|history]] of investing in shipping. A beautifully hand-crafted model of one of the Carta’s largest ships adorns a table in the centre of the main lobby, carved with nautical patterns of compasses and distant shores. Within the back chambers, an old, stone fireplace dredged from the [[Bay of Catazar]], dominates the room. It originally belonged to the old [[Guild|guild]] palace from the [[Caricomare]] which sank during the flooding 45 years ago and now stands as a monument to persistence.
The top floors are given over to rooms for a moderately sized carta with dedicated quarters for use by the custodian of the tower; responsible for its maintenance and collecting the valuable mana that can be found within. At the top of the tower, gleaming foci of [[Mithril|mithril]] stream light blazing into a chamber at the very heart of the uppermost room. A constant glow emits from [[The Chamber|the chamber]], christening its local name as [[The Lantern|the lantern]] room and further enhancing its image of a lighthouse. The mana pools within the central chamber and often crystallises in a pure white variant, almost as if it had captured the sun.
