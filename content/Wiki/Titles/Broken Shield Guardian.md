### Overview
The [[Broken Shield Guardian]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by the [[Civilian Commissioner]] of the [[Imperial Orcs]] in [[Winter]] 380YE. The position is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of [[Herbs|herbs]] to the title holder. 
## Responsibilities
As a [[Sinecure|sinecure]], the [[Broken Shield Guardian]] has few responsibilities. If the Home of the Broken Shield were threatened, it would be the responsibility of the [[Guardian]] to deal with that threat - but also to deal with any [[Opportunity]] to expand the Home,  or to make any decisions about its operation.
## Powers
### Bounty of Herbs
The residents of the Home of the Broken Shield maintain several [[Herb|herb]] gardens. The Guardian receives a share of those herbs, which amounts to 6 doses of [[Imperial Roseweald]], 5 doses each of [[Marrowort]] and [[Bladeroot]], and 2 doses of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]] each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The Broken Shield Guardian is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[Senator]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Imperial Orc citizen. The Guardian has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down, and they can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Imperial Orc [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## House of the Broken Shield
The House is the home of a [[Banner|banner]] of [[Imperial Orcs]] who are too "broken" to [[Fight|fight]] on the front line, but are still driven to serve [[The Empire|the Empire]]. It accepts orcs from other warbands who wish to "retire" but still work in support of their people and their Empire. Several residents are civil servants, while others serve as scribes, teachers, and [[Preachers]], all over [[Skarsind]]. Among their prominent members are Broken Shield Talik, who served at one time as [[Speaker for the Senate]]. Their symbol is a white circle marred with black cracks.
The structure itself stands in Solvihill, and incorporates parts of the old Irontongue Hall. The Hall itself was significantly damaged by the [[Thule]] but has been rebuilt and repurposed. It now has a central courtyard where herbs are tended, and the many items of [[Worth]] collected by the residents during their [[Battles|battles]] are hung on the walls. A small memorial to [[General]] Dustan Irontongue, and to [[Empress Britta]], and the soldiers who fell alongside her (Imperial Orcs and human alike) is maintained in a quiet wing of the House.
The residents are primarily ex-soldiers who can no longer [[Fight|fight]] due to age or injury. Some stay at the House temporarily, but most are permanent residents. They maintain good relations with the Fellowship of the Red Blade, who visit regularly. Many of the residents also serve as teachers, offering their hard-won expertise to the next generation of Imperial Orc warriors. 
Those with more limited mobility, or who are done with traveling, tend the gardens here. The House produces a bounty of healing herbs, and is already making a name for itself for ''Broken Shield Tea'' - a particular blend of [[Imperial Roseweald]] and other herbs that "warms the blood" of orc drinkers in a pleasantly narcotic fashion. There are even a few carefully cultivated patches of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], grown indoors to protect them from the poor climate of the northern Empire - sadly the [[Herb|herb]] grows very poorly in the north - it is better suited to the warmer climes around the [[Bay of Catazar]]. The only herb not grown at the House is [[True Vervain]]. The only comment on this comes from one of the first Orcs to take residence, Bloodblade Tikkat, who snorted and said that True Vervain "''is too easy to grow - there is no fight to it and without a fight, no [[Challenge|challenge]]!''"
