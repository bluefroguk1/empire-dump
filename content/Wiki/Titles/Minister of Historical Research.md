## Overview
The [[Minister of Historical Research]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]]. It was established by [[Create title of Minister of Historical Research|majority vote of the Senate in Autumn 377]] to help the Senate handle requests for [[Historical research]]. Prior to the Spring Equinox 384YE, two other titles (the [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] and the [[Imperial Advisor for the Feni]]) also had the power to commission [[Historical research]]. Their powers [[385YE Spring Equinox Senate sessions#Amend Historical Research|were removed]] following [[A long December#Hold On To These Moments|changes]] to how the [[Historical research#The Department of Historical Research|Department]] was organised. The Minister is now the only title able to instruct the Department to perform research on their behalf.
## Responsibilities

To use this power, the Minister provides an [[Senate announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the [[Imperial Senate]]. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Minister. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Minister's decision.
## Appointment
