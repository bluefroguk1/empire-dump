## Overview
The [[Minister of Historical Research]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the Senate. It was established by majority vote of the Senate in Autumn 377 to help the Senate handle requests for [[Historical research]]. Prior to the Spring Equinox 384YE, two other titles (the [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] and the [[Imperial Advisor for the Feni]]) also had the power to [[Commission]] Historical research. Their powers were removed following changes to how the Department was organised. The Minister is now the only title able to instruct the Department to perform research on their behalf.
## Responsibilities
The purpose of the Minister is to authorise research requests, freeing the [[Imperial Senate]] from the need to assess each request directly.
## Power
### Historical Research
The Minister has the power to announce Historical research requests. The civil service is able to process just one research request each season - research requests authorized by the Senate or the Minister all count against this limit. 
To use this power, the Minister provides an announcement to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the Imperial Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Minister. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Minister's decision.
## [[Appointment]]
The Minister of Historical Research is an Imperial position appointed by the Senate. Any Imperial citizen can hold this title. The Minister serves for a year, and they can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] and by the Assembly of the Nine.
