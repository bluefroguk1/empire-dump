## Overview
Each of the eight virtue assemblies appoints a [[Cardinal]] to represent and lead them. The [[Cardinal of Ambition]] represents the [[Ambition]] [[Assembly]], and is part of what is arguably the most powerful of the Assemblies, the Assembly of the Nine. While they are still able to raise only a single [[Judgement]] for consideration by their peers in the [[Imperial Synod]] each season, they possess a number of specific legal powers that allow them to guide and influence the Assemblies. 
The recent Severin encyclical prompted a great deal of discussion around the role of the cardinals in the Imperial Synod.
## Responsibilities
The Cardinal of Ambition is assumed to provide leadership to the priests and pilgrims dedicated to that virtue. They are expected to be well versed in matters of Ambition, and of [[The Way]] in [[General]], so that they can speak with authority on matters related to the study of Ambition, and of doctrine. ProMinent citizens who are guilty of breaking the law but believe their actions were rooted in Ambition will often approach the Cardinal to plead Clemency on their behalf, so a familiarity with the law may also prove helpful.
As a member of the Assembly of the Nine, the Cardinal of Ambition can wield considerable influence over the politics of [[The Empire]]. In particular the Assembly has the power to [[Veto]] any constitutional motion passed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. This allows the Assembly to uphold their constitutional obligation to "ensure the virtuous behaviour of the Empire".
## Powers
### Cardinal of Ambition
The Cardinal of Ambition has the powers common to all cardinals: membership of the Assembly of the Nine; the ability to call for further [[Scrutiny]] on a Judgement raised in any Assembly by a [[Member of the Synod]] (rather than by the Tribunes); appoint the [[Gatekeeper of Ambition]] and any other titles designated as virtuous Appointments chosen by the Cardinal of the Assembly of Ambition.
### Virtue Appointments
A virtue title might be designed in such a way that it is appointed by the Cardinal alone. Currently they have the power to appoint the [[Gatekeeper]] of Ambition, an important position that controls the distribution of true [[Liao]].
### Additional Powers
The Cardinal of Ambition may possess additional powers, not shared with their fellow cardinals, either through the action of the Imperial Senate or through opportunities presented to them. Occasionally, a particularly ambitious Imperial citizen may look specifically to the Cardinal for inspiration, such as happened recently with the [[Architect]] Frederick di [[Sarvos]]. Using such powers generally requires them to raise a Judgement in the Assembly of the Nine.
## [[Appointment]]
The Cardinal of Ambition is appointed during the Spring Equinox by the Assembly of Ambition. All candidates must be a member of that assembly. Selection is by a judgement of Appointment raised by the Tribune in the standard manner.
The elections for the cardinals are considered to be legally equivalent positions restricted by virtue. This means that if you change your virtue assembly then you must abstain from voting in a election if it occurs less than four Events after the previous election in your previous virtue assembly. If you are in any doubt about your eligibility then you should consult the Tribune, or [[Merlot]] the civil service overSeer of elections who can adVise you.
The judgement to appoint a Cardinal will typically close at 6pm on the Saturday of the summit. These times may differ if an unscheduled appointment is required but there are always at least three hours for nominations and three hours for voting. After that time, the candidate with the most support is declared Cardinal.
The Cardinal of Ambition serves until the next scheduled election for the title. They can be revoked by the General Assembly, or by the virtue assembly of Ambition.
