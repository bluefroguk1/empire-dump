## Autumn's Boon
“Shining Gliss Steining, [[Runesmith|runesmith]] of the mark,
Lit sparks of [[Prosperity|prosperity]], bright in the dark,
While she held shining steel, gave her life for her kin,
She wove [[Ritual|ritual]] words to bring great harvests in.
This balance is key for the might of our home,
For there are both [[Heroes|heroes]] of field and of loam.
Though gliss, small fruit did her [[Ambition|ambition]] yield 
Ensured these bright crystals [[Prosperity]] build. “  
Autumn's Boon is found in  [[Hahnmark]] near Old Woodhall not far from the Dunsfall Sinkhole. It is positioned near both the hall of Hendal Hearth and New Dunhall, close to both the Valley of [[Pride]], Vale's Might, Fallsheart Cave, and Dunfirth.
This Boon itself stands on the hillside between the Valley of [[Pride]] and Vale's Might. It takes the form of a roofed stone hall covering a shallow, natural amphitheatre and the [[Spring|spring]] that bubbles at its centre. Crystals form on tiers of stone steps inlaid with [[Mithril|mithril]] that stagger the inside of the building, which can be illuminated by flaming braziers set on the walls. Two huge doors, marked with the [[Rune]] of Wealth allow access to the inside for the custodian to collect the growing crystals. To either side of the gates are granite statues of an armoured [[Steinr]] [[Naga]], the fallen hero known as “Shining Gliss Steining”. Each statue presents a shield against an unseen enemy, her sword ready to strike with all her might. Upon the [[Gate|gate]] posts etched into the stone there is a poem about Shining Gliss Steining.
The [[Runes]] of Autumn are carved upon the stone cross beam above the main gates along with the words “These statues stand in remembrance, So future generations know that the [[Heroes|heroes]] of the past have fallen to give them and [[The Empire|the Empire]] a future. This is a testament to the virtues of [[The Empire|the Empire]] that [[Empower|empower]] and drive us all.''”
