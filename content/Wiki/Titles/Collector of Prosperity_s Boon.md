## Autumn's Boon
“Shining Gliss Steining, runesmith of the mark,
Lit sparks of prosperity, bright in the dark,
While she held shining steel, gave her life for her kin,
She wove ritual words to bring great harvests in.
This balance is key for the might of our home,
For there are both heroes of field and of loam.
Though gliss, small fruit did her ambition yield 
Ensured these bright crystals Prosperity build. “  
Autumn's Boon is found in  [[Hahnmark]] near Old Woodhall not far from the [[Hahnmark#The Dunsfall Sinkhole|Dunsfall Sinkhole]]. It is positioned near both the hall of [[Wintermark groups#Hendal Hearth|Hendal Hearth]] and [[Caretaker of New Dunhall#New Dunhall|New Dunhall]], close to both the [[Herbalist of the Hearth#The Valley of Pride|Valley of Pride]], [[Keeper of the Crystal Vale#Vale.27s Might|Vale's Might]], [[Fallsheart Guardian#Fallsheart Cave|Fallsheart Cave]], and [[Guardian of Dunfrith#Dunfirth|Dunfirth]].
This Boon itself stands on the hillside between the Valley of Pride and Vale's Might. It takes the form of a roofed stone hall covering a shallow, natural amphitheatre and the spring that bubbles at its centre. Crystals form on tiers of stone steps inlaid with mithril that stagger the inside of the building, which can be illuminated by flaming braziers set on the walls. Two huge doors, marked with the [[Pallas|Rune of Wealth]] allow access to the inside for the custodian to collect the growing crystals. To either side of the gates are granite statues of an armoured [[Steinr]] [[Naga]], the fallen hero known as “Shining Gliss Steining”. Each statue presents a shield against an unseen enemy, her sword ready to strike with all her might. Upon the gate posts etched into the stone there is a poem about Shining Gliss Steining.
The [[Runes#Runes of Autumn|Runes of Autumn]] are carved upon the stone cross beam above the main gates along with the words “These statues stand in remembrance, So future generations know that the heroes of the past have fallen to give them and the Empire a future. This is a testament to the virtues of the Empire that empower and drive us all.''”
