## Overview
The [[Challenger in Waiting]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[Dawn]]. Construction of the [[Challenger in Waiting]] was [[Construct Challenger in Waiting|announced]] by Valentin Ivarovich Orzel as [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave|Bearer of the Second Imperial Wayleave]] during the Spring Summer 385YE.
## Responsibilities
The [[Challenger in Waiting]] has a responsibility to scrutinise the Virtue of any potential challengers to the [[Dawn monarchy#The Monarchy in Play|Monarch of Dawn]]. If the sinecure were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Challenger in Waiting to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides 6 doses of [[Liao]] to the Challenger in Waiting each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in the Synod
The Challenger in Waiting may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 12 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 12 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly for which [[Sinecure#Synod Votes|they are eligible]].
## Appointment
The Challenger in Waiting is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]] of Dawn each year during the Autumn Equinox. The expectation is that the appointment will follow a tourney in the same style as the seasonal grand tourneys that appoint the [[Knight-protector|Knights-protector]]. There is no legal requirement for the National Assembly of Dawn to arrange, or acknowledge, such a tournament however.
There is an expectation that the title can only be held once in a lifetime but this is very much not a legal limit, as with the [[Conscience of the Senate]], and is not enforceable in any way.
The title can be held by any citizen of Dawn. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Dawn National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
