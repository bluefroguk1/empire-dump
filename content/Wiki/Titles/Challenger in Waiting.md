## Overview
The [[Challenger in Waiting]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[Dawn]]. Construction of the [[Challenger in Waiting]] was announced by Valentin Ivarovich Orzel as Bearer of the Second Imperial Wayleave during the [[Spring]] [[Summer]] 385YE.
## Responsibilities
The Challenger in Waiting has a responsibility to scrutinise the Virtue of any potential challengers to the Monarch of [[Dawn]]. If the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Challenger in Waiting to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### A Portion of [[Liao]]
The [[Sinecure|sinecure]] provides 6 doses of [[Liao]] to the Challenger in Waiting each season, to be used as they see fit. 
### Voice in [[The Synod|the Synod]]
The Challenger in Waiting may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 12 votes in [[Synod]] affairs (or an additional 12 votes if they already have a [[Congregation]]). They may use these votes in any [[Assembly|assembly]] for which they are eligible.
## [[Appointment]]
The Challenger in Waiting is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the [[National Assembly]] of Dawn each year during the [[Autumn]] Equinox. The expectation is that the [[Appointment|appointment]] [[Will|will]] follow a tourney in the same style as the seasonal grand tourneys that appoint the Knights-protector. There is no legal requirement for the National [[Assembly]] of Dawn to arrange, or acknowledge, such a tournament however.
There is an expectation that the title can only be held once in a lifetime but this is very much not a legal limit, as with the [[Conscience of the Senate]], and is not enforceable in any way.
The title can be held by any citizen of Dawn. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Dawn National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
