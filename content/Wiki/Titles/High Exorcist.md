## Overview
The position was established by unanimous vote of the Senate in Winter 377YE. The [[High Exorcist]] exists to adVise the Military Council on the use of ceremonies on [[The Battlefield]]. The intent is that the priest who holds the title will co-ordinate the use of [[Liao]] against malign Auras and creatures during Imperial military actions. A stipend was assigned to allow the High Exorcist to obtain, [[Commission]] and distribute such items or works as are needed in support of this goal. Examples of the latter might include Liao for use in ceremonies of [[Exorcism]] or magical items such as a [[Beneficent Sigil]] or an [[Icon of the Justicar]].
The original motion to create the title attempted to grant the ''Right of Address'' in the Military Council, but at the time this was ruled unconstitutional. Further examination of the situation led to a reversal of that decision in 378YE. In Spring 379YE the Senate voted to increase the High Exorcist's stipend from the original 3 Thrones each season to 7 Thrones each season.
__TOC__
During the Spring Equinox 381YE the Senate voted to remove the High Exorcist's stipend and replace it with the power to withdraw funds. A [[Veto]] was raised before the Synod against this motion, but it was not upheld. Shortly before the Summer Solstive 385YE, however, the Constitutional Court ruled that the ability to withdraw funds directly from the virtue fund was unconstitutional, and struck the power down. The Senate then aMended the title that season to replace it's stipend at 8 Thrones each season.
## Responsibilities
The High Exorcist is expected to advise the Military Council on the use of religious ceremonies on the battlefield, and to co-ordinate volunteers using liao against malign auras and spiritual enemies.
## Powers
### Right of Address
The High Exorcist has the right to make a address to the [[Imperial Military Council]] once per summit. This is intended to allow them to advise the Military Council on spiritual matters, to offer [[Assistance]] or to ask for assistance in helping the priests of [[The Way]] to better support Imperial forces. To use this power, the High Exorcist informs the [[Herald of the Council]] that they wish to make an address, which will then be added to the agenda for the next [[Council session]].
### Stipend
The High Exorcist receives a stipend of 8 Thrones each season from the [[Imperial treasury]].
## [[Appointment]]
The High Exorcist is appointed by [[Judgement]] of the [[Assembly]] of Nine during the Winter Solstice. 
Any Imperial citizen can hold the title of High Exorcist. They can be revoked by a lesser majority of the [[General]] Assembly.
To Veto the Senate proposal to abrogate the High Exorcist Stipend of 7 thrones per season from the Imperial Budget and grant them the power to withdraw 7 Thrones from the Virtue Fund without the Synod being at to vote or veto.
