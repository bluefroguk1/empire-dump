## Overview
The position was established by unanimous [[Create title of High Exorcist|vote of the Senate in Winter 377YE]]. The [[High Exorcist]] exists to advise the [[Imperial Military Council|Military Council]] on the use of [[Religious skills|ceremonies]] on the battlefield. The intent is that the priest who holds the title will co-ordinate the use of liao against malign auras and creatures during Imperial military actions. A [[#Stipend|stipend]] was assigned to allow the [[High Exorcist]] to obtain, commission and distribute such items or works as are needed in support of this goal. Examples of the latter might include [[Liao]] for use in ceremonies of [[Religious skills#Exorcism|exorcism]] or magical items such as a [[Beneficent Sigil]] or an [[Icon of the Justicar]].
The original motion to create the title attempted to grant the ''Right of Address'' in the Military Council, but at the time this was [[Create title of High Exorcist#Constitution|ruled unconstitutional]]. Further examination of the situation led to a reversal of that decision in 378YE. In Spring 379YE the Senate [[Amend powers of the High Exorcist |voted to increase]] the [[High Exorcist]]'s stipend from the original 3 Thrones each season to 7 Thrones each season.
__TOC__
During the Spring Equinox 381YE the Senate [[Amend powers of the High Exorcist II|voted to remove]] the High Exorcist's stipend and replace it with the power to withdraw funds. A veto was raised before the Synod against this motion, but it was not upheld. Shortly before the Summer Solstive 385YE, however, the Constitutional Court ruled that the [[Rings and crowns#Virtue and Reward|ability to withdraw funds directly from the virtue fund was unconstitutional]], and struck the power down. The Senate then [[385YE Summer Solstice Senate sessions#Amend High Exorcist|amended the title]] that season to replace it's stipend at 8 Thrones each season.
