## Overview
Constructed by order of ''Irina Vasillova Dukov'' as the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]], work on the construction of the Trade Exchange was completed shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice 383YE. The [[Opportunity]] arose as part of the conquest of [[Ossium]], and was requested by the inhabitants of the town of Ketsov.
## Responsibilities
The [[Burgher of Ketsov]] is expected to ensure the [[Prosperity]] of the town by overseeing trade. If the Trade Exchange was ever directly threatened, the Burgher would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity]] related to the Trade Exchange.

### [[Ministry]]
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Burgher allows the holder to purchase fine weapons and armour at a set price. The Burgher spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and ribbons are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
### Ketsov Mir Mozga
In addition to the [[Magic Items|magic items]] created by the Ketsov, the Ketsov Mir Mozga in the woods of [[Karsk]] sends copious amounts of Dragonbone and other Forest [[Materials|materials]] home to [[Ossium]]. The burgher is able to purchase some of that surplus.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice. The [[Burgher of Ketsov]] is awarded to whichever Varushkan candidate receives the most support from Varushkan owners of mines and forests. Votes are recorded in private in conjunction with the civil servants who support [[The Bourse|the Bourse]].
The title is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies or steps down. An [[Imperial Bourse]] seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## The Ketsov [[Family]]
The Ketsov were among the first humans [[The Empire|the Empire]] really dealt with in Ossium, even before the [[Territory|territory]] had been entirely conquered. Descended from Varushkan settlers enslaved by the [[Druj]], they fared much better than many of the other former slaves by making themselves useful to their orc masters. By providing the orcs with weapons and armour and [[Magic]] Items they enjoyed a level of freedom and relative status practically unknown elsewhere in the territory. 
They were, however, very keen to embrace the [[Opportunities|opportunities]] presented by being freed from the [[Druj]] and becoming Imperial citizens. They were among the first people native to Ossium to become Varushkan citizens, and proposed the creation of the Ketsov Trading Exchange in their home town. This lead to the establishment of the Burgher of Ketsov; the [[Family|family]] is very keen to see the [[Prosperity|prosperity]] of their vale increase. 
The family is not well liked by their neighbours, the former slaves of the Druj both human and orc alike. They warn that the Ketsov are not to be trusted. They cooperated with the Druj for generations, winning concessions and avoiding the worst of the horrors faced by those subject to their dominion. [[The Empire]] would be better having as little to do with them as possible, say these vales. The Ketsov sneer at their detractors. They simply did what any other Varushkan vale would likely have done - they made an accommodation with the dark powers that threatened to destroy them. There is no difference between bargaining with orcs who can snuff out your people and bargaining with some hungry spirit, bloodthirsty [[Plaguewulf|plaguewulf]], or monstrous tree. If anything, it is the vales who ''didn't'' do everything in their power to reach some compromise with the Druj that have failed to live up to what it means to be Varushkan. 
Regardless of this conflict, it cannot be denied that they are native Ossium Varushkans. The [[Mandate|mandate]] of Konstantin Rabovich Bolotnikov upheld by the Varushkan [[Assembly|assembly]] in [[Winter]] 383YE encouraged sellswords to help them build and establish their presence in Ossium just as much as it did the other former subjects of the Druj. The Ketsov have seized this opportunity with both hands, reinforcing the walls of the town that shares their name, and establishing forestry operations among the trees south of the Bonewood. They are scrupulously careful not to stray too far north, but they also seem to be "courting" the [[Thule]] a little - offering a warm welcome to any of their merchants that come south.
They've also been looking for other opportunities to expand their wealth, and security. From a visiting [[Wagon raider|wagon raider]], they learned of the Mir Mozga in the forests of Lestazny in [[Karsk]]. Since the death of Pyotr Kresnovich Triosny, the former master of the Mir Mozga, the forests near Isember had grown wild and chaotic. The family suggested that they would be the perfect people to establish a small new vale in the area. As Ossium natives, they argued, there was a certain symbolic rightness to allowing them to settle some of their people in a different Varushkan territory. After all, had not a great many western Varushkans come to their home, to Ossium, to establish new settlements? Is it not only right that they be encouraged to spread their family across their new nation likewise?
[[The Senate]] agreed - or agreed enough to allow the establishment of the Ketsov Mir Mozga in Lestazny - several large families of the Ketsov now make their home and harvest the dragonbone. The majority of the dragonbone they produce is used or sold by the new vale but a portion of it would obviously be sent back to Ossium, enriching the Ketsov and their neighbours. They are quire prepared to share part of that bounty with their friends - the Burgher of Ketsov would gain the ability to buy dragonbone as part of their existing ministry. They're also keen to make ''new'' friends in Karsk - rather than export it themselves, the ''Ketsov Mir Mozga'' are sell some of the forest riches they gather to the [[Custodian of Ivarsgard Docks]] and are actively seeking closer ties with the western vale.
While they may not be popular, they are certainly effective. While establishing the Ketsov Mir Mozga, the family also provided significant support to help resolve the Isember problem - both in the form of armed soldiers and useful [[Magic Items|magic items]].
