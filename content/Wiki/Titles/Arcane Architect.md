## Overview
The [[Arcane Architect]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the [[Imperial Conclave]]. The title was created by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Autumn Equinox 379YE.
When the title was initially created, it had an unlimited power to [[Commission]] the construction of mana structures. The Senate aMended the power to once per season as part of an administrative motion. The Senate voted to further amend the powers of the Arcane [[Architect]] during the Autumn Equinox 383YE by extending their power of commission to ministries and Great works.
==Responsibilities== 
The Arcane Architect is responsible for supporting the ritual Magicians of [[The Empire]] in virtuous application of mana.
## Powers
### Commission construction of mana structures
Once per summit, the Arcane Architect can Commission the construction of Sinecures, ministries, or great works that produce crystal mana. The [[Materials]] required for construction are provided by the Arcane Architect. In the case of a [[Sinecure]] or [[Ministry]] this would create a new Imperial title, one that is appointed by [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. These titles must be Imperial titles, rather than national titles (meaning they can be held by any citizen). As with any other title appointed through the Imperial Conclave, these subsidiary titles cannot be revoked by any [[Assembly]] of the [[Imperial Synod]].
To use this power, the Arcane Architect provides an announcement to the Civil Service, and then presents the announcement to the Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Arcane Architect. The Imperial Synod may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Arcane Architect's commission.
In Summer 382YE, the civil service raised an administrative motion to confirm that the Arcane Architect could Commission sinecures that would produce [[Vis]], as well as those that would produce crystal mana. The Senate confirmed this was their intent.
### Toad Wand
During the Winter Solstice 379YE, the [[Eternal]] [[Sadogua]] pledged to provide a [[Magic]] item to the Arcane Architect. This item takes the form of a wand surmounted by a toad. Sadogua has pledged to re-[[Empower]] the wand every year during the Winter Solstice, as long as he enjoys the amity of the Imperial Conclave. The powers of the wand have not been made public knowledge.
## [[Appointment]]
The appointment, replacement, or removal of the Arcane Architect is made by the Declaration of Candidacy as part of a [[Conclave session]].
The Arcane Architect serves until they are replaced by another magician using the Declaration of Candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, they cannot be revoked.
