## Overview
The [[Arcane Architect]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the [[Imperial Conclave]]. The title was created by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the [[Autumn]] Equinox 379YE.
When the title was initially created, it had an unlimited power to [[Commission]] the construction of mana structures. [[The Senate]] amended the power to once per season as part of an [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]]. The [[Senate]] voted to further amend the powers of the Arcane [[Architect]] during the Autumn Equinox 383YE by extending their power of [[Commission|commission]] to ministries and great works.
==Responsibilities== 
The [[Arcane Architect]] is responsible for supporting the [[Ritual|ritual]] magicians of [[The Empire|the Empire]] in virtuous application of mana.
## Powers
### [[Commission]] construction of mana structures
Once per summit, the Arcane [[Architect]] can [[Commission]] the construction of sinecures, ministries, or great works that produce crystal mana. The [[Materials|materials]] required for construction are provided by the [[Arcane Architect]]. In the case of a [[Sinecure]] or [[Ministry]] this would create a new [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]], one that is appointed by [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. These titles must be Imperial titles, rather than national titles (meaning they can be held by any citizen). As with any other title appointed through the [[Imperial Conclave]], these subsidiary titles cannot be revoked by any [[Assembly|assembly]] of the [[Imperial Synod]].
To use this power, the Arcane [[Architect]] provides an announcement to the Civil Service, and then presents the announcement to the Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the [[Arcane Architect]]. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Arcane [[Architect]]'s [[Commission|commission]].
In [[Summer]] 382YE, the civil service raised an administrative motion to confirm that the [[Arcane Architect]] could commission sinecures that would produce [[Vis]], as well as those that would produce crystal mana. The Senate confirmed this was their intent.
### Toad Wand
During the [[Winter]] Solstice 379YE, the [[Eternal]] [[Sadogua]] pledged to provide a [[Magic|magic]] item to the Arcane [[Architect]]. This item takes the form of a wand surmounted by a toad. [[Sadogua]] has pledged to re-[[Empower|empower]] the wand every year during the Winter Solstice, as long as he enjoys the amity of the Imperial [[Conclave]]. The powers of the wand have not been made public knowledge.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Appointment|appointment]], replacement, or removal of the Arcane Architect is made by the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]].
The Arcane Architect serves until they are replaced by another [[Magician|magician]] using the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. As a title in [[The Conclave|the Conclave]], they cannot be revoked.
