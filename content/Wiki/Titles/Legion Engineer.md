## Overview
The title was created in [[Summer]] 382YE when the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to reallocate one of the Imperial Wayleaves auctioned by [[The Bourse|the Bourse]] to the exclusive use of the [[Imperial Orcs]]. There were some initial Constitutional Court issues around the [[Appointment|appointment]] of the title, but they were quickly resolved.  it was further amended during [[Winter]] 383YE, following clarification of its [[Appointment|appointment]] method and usage of its power to [[Commission|commission]] new construction. At the same time, the Constitutional Court changed the name of the title to "[[Legion Engineer]]" to better reflect the fact that it was significantly different to the existing Wayleave titles.
==Responsibilities== 
The [[Legion Engineer]] has no particular responsibilities and may use the authority granted by the title to order any [[Commission|commission]] they choose. 
## Powers
### Commission
Once during each summit, the Legion Engineer can Commission the construction of a [[Sinecure]], [[Ministry]], [[Great work]], or [[Spy network]]. The [[Materials|materials]] and money required for construction must be provided by the Engineer or their agents.
If the Legion Engineer announces the commission of a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] or [[Ministry|ministry]] then an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the commission is automatically created. The location and size of the commission and the method of appointment and [[Tenure|tenure]] of any associated title are all part of the necessary details and may be included in the announcement made by the Engineer or determined later by them.
The Legion Engineer cannot alter an existing commission.
### Announcement
To use their power of commission, the Legion Engineer must make an announcement in the [[Imperial Senate]]. No voting is possible by [[The Senate|the Senate]] at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Legion Engineer. 
The [[Imperial Synod]] may choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Legion Engineer's announcement. [[The Throne]] may choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Engineer's announcement.

They not required to build their commission in their own nation and may use any method of appointment (for example, through the [[Bourse]], [[The Conclave|the Conclave]], [[Military Council]], or [[Synod]]). The civil service are on hand to offer legal advice or support to the Engineer just as they are to a [[Senator|senator]], and they may wish to submit their commission for [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] before it is announced to ensure there are no problems with their design.
