## Overview
The title was created in Summer 382YE when the Imperial Senate voted to [[Reallocate an Imperial Wayleave to the Imperial Orcs|reallocate]] one of the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave|Imperial Wayleaves]] auctioned by the Bourse to the exclusive use of the Imperial Orcs. There were some initial [[Reallocate an Imperial Wayleave to the Imperial Orcs|Constitutional Court issues]] around the appointment of the title, but they were quickly resolved.  it was further [[383YE Winter Solstice Senate sessions#Amend Imperial Orc Wayleave|amended]] during Winter 383YE, following clarification of its appointment method and usage of its power to [[#Commission|commission]] new construction. At the same time, the Constitutional Court changed the name of the title to "[[Legion Engineer]]" to better reflect the fact that it was significantly different to the existing Wayleave titles.
==Responsibilities== 
The [[Legion Engineer]] has no particular responsibilities and may use the authority granted by the title to order any commission they choose. 
## Powers
### Commission
Once during each summit, the [[Legion Engineer]] can [[Commission]] the construction of a [[Sinecure]], [[Ministry]], [[Great work]], or [[Spy network]]. The materials and money required for construction must be provided by the Engineer or their agents.
If the Legion Engineer announces the commission of a sinecure or ministry then an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the commission is automatically created. The location and size of the commission and the method of appointment and tenure of any associated title are all part of the [[Motion wording#Necessary Details|necessary details]] and may be included in the announcement made by the Engineer or determined later by them.
The Legion Engineer cannot [[Commission#Altering an Existing Commission|alter an existing commission]].
### Announcement
To use their power of commission, the Legion Engineer must make an [[Senate announcement|announcement]] in the Imperial Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Legion Engineer. 
The [[Imperial Synod]] may choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Legion Engineer's announcement. The [[Throne]] may choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Engineer's announcement.
## Limitations
The Legion Engineer can only commission a sinecure, ministry, spy network, or great work.
Unlike a [[Civilian Commissioner]], the Engineer is not prohibited from using their power to commission anything that provides liao or votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. However, the appointment of such a title is still subject to [[Motion wording#Necessary Details|the normal constitutional restrictions]].
They not required to build their commission in their own nation and may use any method of appointment (for example, through the Bourse, the Conclave, Military Council, or Synod). The civil service are on hand to offer legal advice or support to the Engineer just as they are to a [[Senator|senator]], and they may wish to submit their commission for scrutiny before it is announced to ensure there are no problems with their design.
## Selection
As a national position, it is appointed by vote of Imperial Orc [[Military unit]] captains with the assistance of the Bourse civil servants. The position is appointed annually at the Autumn Equinox.
Only an Imperial Orc character may hold this title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title in the Bourse, they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
