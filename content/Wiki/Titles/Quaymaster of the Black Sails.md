## Overview
The ''[[Quaymaster of the Black Sails]]'' is an [[Imperial Title]], responsible for overseeing the Black Sails Quay, part of the Imperial docks at Crown's Quay in [[Necropolis]]. The Back Sails Quay is dedicated to the use of ships from [[Axos]] involved in trading valuable Axou goods for Imperial [[Liao]]. Following the [[Mandate]] raised by Maximillian Ankarien in [[Summer]] 383YE, encouraging Imperial [[Traders|traders]] to seek out closer ties with the people of [[Axos]], an influx of [[Traders|traders]] from the Chambers of Issyk and Halls of Maykop brought additional [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to sell large amounts of [[Liao|liao]] directly for cash.
When they were first established, the title of Quaymaster was assigned by the [[Loyalty]] [[Assembly|assembly]]. In 384YE however, after several low-key incidents involving accusations of heresy, the merchants of Axos requested a different method of [[Appointment|appointment]] be implemented as they were uncomfortable dealing with "agents of the Creator." [[The Synod]] was resistant to their demands, but during the [[Spring]] Equinox the [[Imperial Senate]] amended the title so that it would instead be auctioned. This also had the effect of moving the title from being a [[Synod]] position to being a [[Bourse]] position - meaning it could no longer be revoked by the assemblies.
## Responsibilities
The [[Quaymaster of the Black Sails]] is expected to ensure that the citadels of Axos continue to exchange trade goods for Imperial liao. If this trade, or the Black Sails Quay, were ever directly threatened, the Quaymaster would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity|opportunity]] related to them. The continued operation of the quays, and thus the [[Ministry|ministry]], requires that relations between [[The Empire|the Empire]] and Axos remain cordial - the Quaymaster thus has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

As a Ministry, the title of Quaymaster of the Black Sails allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] at a set price. The Quaymaster makes their decision how much liao to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. The liao is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the [[Autumn]] Equinox. As of Summer 384YE, the title is auctioned by the civil servants associated with [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
The title may be held by any Imperial citizen. As an [[Imperial Bourse]] title, the Quaymaster cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]]. 
## Black Sails Quay
Crown's Quay in Longbeach sees significant international traffic, much of it diplomatic in nature. Shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE, some modifications were made to one of the quays, modifying them to better accommodate the sleek black sailed ships from the Citadels of Axos. At the same time, a building opposite the quay was converted for the use of the Quaymaster and the Axou merchants with which they [[Will|will]] deal. 
The exchange itself is a wide squat building, characterised by large rooms with lots of open space. What furnishings exist are comfortable, but perhaps unsurprisingly for a building facilitating meetings predominantly between Highborn civil servants and Axou traders the decorations can only be described as austere. Even though the Quaymaster is appointed by the Synod, and located in [[Highguard]], and deals in a uniquely spiritual material, the exchange has less religious imagery than might be expected. That said, a small area is set aside that can be consecrated to one of the virtues specifically for the use of traders who prefer to [[Conduct|conduct]] their [[Business|business]] in such a setting.
