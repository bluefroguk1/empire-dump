## Overview
The ''[[Quaymaster of the Black Sails]]'' is an [[Imperial Title]], responsible for overseeing the [[#Black Sails Quay|Black Sails Quay]], part of the Imperial docks at [[Necropolis#Longbeach|Crown's Quay]] in [[Necropolis]]. The Back Sails Quay is dedicated to the use of ships from [[Axos]] involved in trading valuable Axou goods for Imperial [[Liao]]. Following the [[Mandate]] [[383YE Summer Solstice Synod judgements#Judgement 27|raised]] by Maximillian Ankarien in Summer 383YE, encouraging Imperial traders to seek out closer ties with the people of Axos, an influx of traders from the Chambers of Issyk and Halls of Maykop brought [[A mountain of vipers#Traders from Issyk|additional opportunities]] to sell large amounts of liao directly for cash.
When they were first established, the title of Quaymaster was assigned by the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Loyalty assembly]]. In 384YE however, after several low-key incidents involving accusations of heresy, the merchants of Axos [[All at sea#Matter of the Black Sails|requested a different method of appointment]] be implemented as they were uncomfortable dealing with "agents of the Creator." The Synod was [[On the outside looking inside#Black Sails and Brokers|resistant to their demands]], but during the Spring Equinox the Imperial Senate [[384YE Spring Equinox Senate sessions#Ratify treaty with Axos|amended the title]] so that it would instead be [[Auction of the Seats|auctioned]]. This also had the effect of moving the title from being a Synod position to being a Bourse position - meaning it could no longer be revoked by the assemblies.
## Responsibilities
The [[Quaymaster of the Black Sails]] is expected to ensure that the citadels of Axos continue to exchange trade goods for Imperial liao. If this trade, or the Black Sails Quay, were ever directly threatened, the Quaymaster would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any opportunity related to them. The continued operation of the quays, and thus the ministry, requires that relations between the Empire and Axos remain cordial - the Quaymaster thus has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Quaymaster of the Black Sails]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials at a set price. The Quaymaster makes their decision how much liao to spend during downtime from their character page. The liao is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox. As of Summer 384YE, the title is auctioned by the civil servants associated with the Bourse. 
The title may be held by any Imperial citizen. As an Imperial Bourse title, the Quaymaster cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]]. 
## Black Sails Quay
Crown's Quay in [[Necropolis#Longbeach|Longbeach]] sees significant international traffic, much of it diplomatic in nature. Shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE, some modifications were made to one of the quays, modifying them to better accommodate the sleek black sailed ships from the Citadels of [[Axos]]. At the same time, a building opposite the quay was converted for the use of the Quaymaster and the Axou merchants with which they will deal. 
The exchange itself is a wide squat building, characterised by large rooms with lots of open space. What furnishings exist are comfortable, but perhaps unsurprisingly for a building facilitating meetings predominantly between [[Highguard|Highborn]] civil servants and Axou traders the decorations can only be described as austere. Even though the Quaymaster is appointed by the Synod, and located in Highguard, and deals in a uniquely spiritual material, the exchange has less religious imagery than might be expected. That said, a small area is set aside that can be [[Consecration|consecrated]] to one of the virtues specifically for the use of traders who prefer to conduct their business in such a setting.
