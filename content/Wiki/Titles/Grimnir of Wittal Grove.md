## Overview
The [[Grimnir of Wittal Grove]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a [[Wintermark]] citizen. The motion to construct the Healing House of Wittal Grove was passed by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the [[Winter]] Solstice 383YE following an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] presented by Elina of Redleaf's Hall. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Grimnir of Wittal Grove]] is expected to oversee the Healing House of Wittal Grove. They have a responsibility to purchase surplus [[Herbs|herbs]] from the [[Grimnir|grimnir]] who visit and to allow the herbalists of [[Kallavesa]] to respond to the needs of the [[Heroes|heroes]] of [[Wintermark]]. If the Healing House of Wittal Grove were to be threatened in any way, however, it would be the responsibility of the Grimnir to deal with those threats.

### [[Ministry]]
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Grimnir of Wittal Grove allows the holder to purchase quantities of herbs at a set price. The Grimnir spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and herbs are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
### Bounty of the marshes
The Healing House of Wittal Grove is also a [[Great work]] that provides a share of herbs to every [[Herb garden]] in [[Kallavesa]] owned by a citizen of Wintermark. As standard this is a selection of random herbs however the Grimnir of Wittal Grove can make an announcement in the [[Imperial Senate]] to indicate which variety of [[Herb|herb]] they wish the [[Herb|herb]] masters to focus on.
If the Grimnir selects [[True Vervain|true vervain]], [[Bladeroot]], [[Marrowort]], or [[Imperial Roseweald|imperial roseweald]] the entire 90 herb bounty [[Will|will]] be of this type. If they pick [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]] - a herb that struggles to prosper in Wintermark, even in the relatively temperate climate of Kallavesa - then the bounty is reduced to 45 herbs but again, every [[Herb garden|herb garden]] [[Will|will]] benefit from added production of the rare healing herb. The Grimnir of Wittal Grove only needs to make an announcement to change the herb, either to a specific type or to return to no particular herbal focus.
No voting is possible by [[The Senate|the Senate]] at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Grimnir of Wittal Grove. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Grimnir's decision.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice by unanimous decision of the senators of Wintermark. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the Imperial [[Senate]] instead. The position of Grimnir of Wittal Grove is intended specifically to be held by a grimnir. Though there is no legal requirement for such a position, the halls who supported the construction are expected to withdraw support if anyone other than a grimnir is elected to the position.
The title can be held by a citizen of Wintermark. The Keeper can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Wintermark [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
