## Overview
The [[Bursar of the Conclave]] is an [[Imperial Title]] bestowed on a [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]]. It is appointed through the [[Imperial Conclave|Conclave]].
The position was [[Create title of Bursar|established]] by unanimous vote of the [[Imperial Senate]] in Summer 377YE. The vote followed extensive political manoeuvring within the Conclave, and a [[Concord|Declaration of Concord]] laying out the responsibilities and powers the magicians wished the Bursar to possess. During Autumn 380YE, the Bursar's ability to participate in the gambits of the Conclave was rendered moot when [[Rules update 2017#IC Explanation 5|certain errors]] that had crept into the Conclave procedures were corrected. At the same time, new opportunities to acquire crystal mana from magicians who did not attend Anvil arose, offering the Bursar an alternative way to increase the wealth of Imperial magicians.
## Responsibilities
The purpose of the Bursar is to help the Conclave raise money to acquire resources for Conclave members and to arrange the purchase of materials and items that the Conclave wishes to acquire. They are expected to liaise closely with the [[Archmage|archmages]] and the [[Grandmaster|grandmasters]] of the [[Conclave order|orders]] to identify what is available and what is required.
