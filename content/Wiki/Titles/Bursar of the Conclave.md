## Overview
The [[Bursar of the Conclave]] is an [[Imperial Title]] bestowed on a [[Magician|magician]]. It is appointed through [[The Conclave|the Conclave]].
The position was established by unanimous vote of the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Summer]] 377YE. The vote followed extensive political manoeuvring within the [[Conclave]], and a [[Declaration]] of [[Concord]] laying out the responsibilities and powers the magicians wished the Bursar to possess. During [[Autumn]] 380YE, the Bursar's ability to participate in the gambits of the Conclave was rendered moot when certain errors that had crept into the Conclave procedures were corrected. At the same time, new [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to acquire crystal mana from magicians who did not attend [[Anvil]] arose, offering the Bursar an alternative way to increase the wealth of Imperial magicians.
## Responsibilities
The purpose of the Bursar is to help the Conclave raise money to acquire resources for Conclave members and to arrange the purchase of [[Materials|materials]] and items that the Conclave wishes to acquire. They are expected to liaise closely with the archmages and the grandmasters of the orders to identify what is available and what is required.
