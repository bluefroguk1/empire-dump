## Overview
The [[Witness of Conclave]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 384YE following calls in the Conclave and [[Imperial Synod]] in Autumn 384YE. After a rocky start, the responsibilities of the title were aMended at the following summit, providing the Witness with additional regalia.
During [[Scrutiny]], the Constitutional Court expressed some caution around the use of the word "inquisit" in the [[Senate motion]] that created the title. They deterMined however that the word is simply a description of what the title should do as part of its responsibilities, rather than an attempt to give a title appointed by the [[Imperial Conclave]] power in the Imperial Synod.
## Responsibilities
The Witness is responsible for identifying sorcerers, and those who should no longer be sorcerers, in [[The Empire]], and is expected to investigate and/or inquisit those with an Imperial Conclave title, to ensure they are not becoming corrupt with power. They are also charged with identifying those who use [[Magic]] to the detriment of the Empire, and identifying those who treat with Eternals to the detriment of fellow Imperial citizens.
Although the Witness has a responsibility to investigate and/or inquisit, unless they maintain a [[Congregation]] and are thus a [[Member of the Synod]], they are unable to raise their own Judgements of [[Inquisition]].

### Regalia
The Witness receives several pieces of regalia, provided via support from the three groups that originally called for the creation of the title.
A small group of magisters from the ''Umbral Shroud'' in [[Necropolis]] endowed the title with the ''Lantern Ring'' as regalia. [[The Ring]] allows a wearer versed in the [[Insight]] ceremony who performs a thorough insight to discover if the person whose [[Aura]] they are observing has recently Visited a ''chamber'' between worlds. It will sometimes reveal what [[Realm]] that chamber was associated with, as well. The Umbral Shroud themselves are a once powerful group of magisters whose numbers have dwindled steadily since the reign of [[Empress Giselle]]. They wished to pass on this unique artefact to the Empire in the hope that it could once more serve its true purpose; ensuring that those who deal with eternals are doing so virtuously, and not seeking to make secret agreements to the detriment of fellow Imperial citizens.
Each year at the Spring Equinox, the Witness receives a ''Thornpath Sash'' created by the vates of the ''Lost Lore Steading'' in [[Miaren]], in respect of the title's responsibility to actively investigate anyone with an Imperial title appointed by the Conclave, and ensure that they are not becoming corrupted by their power. This rare magical item is a focus that grants an additional rank of Autumn Lore when performing [[Ties that Bind]] or [[Hand of the Maker]], and an additional rank of Day lore when performing [[Bright Lantern of Ophis]] or [[Eye of the High Places]]. The sash is intended to help the title-holder gather all the evidence they need to secure a successful declaration of sorcery. If the Witness loses their position, then the item must be given to the new Witness with all appropriate haste. The Witness is enCouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe.
Each season ''Alisoun Bathwater'' and her fellow Threshers in [[The Marches]] provide the Witness with a [[Thresher]]'s Cudgel, Hallowed with the Hallowing of the Torch to serve as a reminder of what needs to be done. In Alisoun's opinion, anyone the Conclave puts in charge of hunting out sorcerers will need a gang to support them who knows how to break both staves and heads. These cudgels will be provided as long as the Witness remains committed to identifying anyone using magic to the detriment of their neighbours, and that the Conclave doesn't seek to limit who they can investigate.
## [[Appointment]]
The appointment, replacement, or removal of the Witness of Conclave is made by the Declaration of [[Candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. The Witness serves until they are replaced by another magician using the Declaration of Candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, they cannot be revoked.
