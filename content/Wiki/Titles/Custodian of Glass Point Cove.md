## Overview
Glass Point Cove is a secluded beach in southern [[Sarvos#Uccelini|Uccelini]]. It was [[Commission|commissioned]] by Dalibor Marek do Saverio Von Temeschwar in summer 381YE, using an Imperial Wayleave. The position is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
While the title is officially "[[Custodian of Glass Point Cove]]", many Sarvosan citizens prefer to call it the "Glass Custodian", drawing parallels with the [[Jade Custodian]] who oversees the [[Jade Custodian#The Wellspring of Jade|Wellspring of Jade]] in northern [[Sarvos#Foracci|Foracci]].
## Responsibilities
The Custodian has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Game items#Mana Crystals|crystal mana]] from [[#Glass Point Cove|Glass Point Cove]]. If the Cove were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Custodian to deal with those threats.  Likewise, if any [[Opportunity]] relating to the cove presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of it.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Custodian receives an income of 9 crystal mana each season from Glass Point Cove.
## Appointment
The [[Custodian of Glass Point Cove]] is selected by unanimous decision of the [[The League]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any League citizen. The Custodian has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the League [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## Glass Point Cove
The exemplar [[Avigliana di Sarvos]] first mentioned the powerful mana flows along the bluffs of Glass Point, but it was Savosan [[Fleet]] captain Richardo Glostari and chairman of Red Raven Holdings Giacomo Corvinscuro who first located a significant mana source in the vicinity.
Glass Point Cove is a secluded sandy beach leading to a cove with luminescent veins of crystal growing through the rock, formed by natural flows seeping through the rocks and being shaped by the tide and winds. A lavish mithril mesh has been established in several parts of the cove to help form crystals in a more accessible manner, and to avoid permanently despoiling the beautiful location. The expensive alterations to the cove were funded by Red Raven Holdings, using an Imperial Wayleave.
Work was made more difficult by the fact the cove was inaccessible from land - and indeed due to the many rocks and the shallow water proved impossible to approach by all save the smallest boats. The precise location of the Cove is not public knowledge - there are concerns that if it becomes commonly known it will risk raiders from the sea. Despite the relative difficulties of getting to the cove, however, there were some signs that Richardo and Giacomo were not the first people to visit the area - and not the first people to see the value of harvesting crystal mana here. Still, judging by the remaining cracked mirrors and silted-over bowls, there was little evidence that anyone else had been in the cove for several years - and when they were there they were operating on a significantly smaller scale than the new owners.
The Glass Point Crystal Cove is the third project of Red Raven Holdings (the previous two being the [[Jade Custodian#The Wellspring of Jade|Wellspring of Jade]] and the [[Signori d'Argento Vine Tender#Signori d'Argento Vineyards|Signori d'Argento vineyard]]). Red Raven Holdings are a building society incorporated in [[Caricomare]], dedicated to constructing sinecures that will benefit the Empire and its citizens.
