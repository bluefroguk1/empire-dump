## Overview
The [[Kalpaheim Tradeholder]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a [[Wintermark]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the [[Autumn]] Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in Delev.
In the years since [[Skarsind]] was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the [[Wintermark]] focus was more on the routes through the passes into [[Hahnmark]] in the north-east. Over [[Winter]] 379YE, work began on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with Torfast Trading Post in [[Skarsind]] as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Temeschwar]]; merchant offices in the town of Delev in [[Karov]], a brokerage in [[Hercynia]] known as the Treji [[Wayhouse]], and now a Tradehall in the settlement of Kalpaheim, in [[Hahnmark]].
In [[Summer]] 381YE, in response to an [[Opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner joined the [[Northern trade network|Northern Trade Network]] bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire|the Empire]] remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire|the Empire]] remains at peace with the [[Thule]].
Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the forests of Metri threatened to sever [[Temeschwar]] from the network, leading to instability along the trade routes, reducing the options available to the Tradeholder. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] were instructed to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  disruption to trade end.
During the Summer of 385YE, following the construction of the [[Temeschwar]]-[[Otkodov]] Mana Exchange far more [[Traders|traders]] from [[Otkodov]] are making the trip to [[Temeschwar]] to sell their wares instead. The completion of the Iron Roads saw an influx of Varushkan trade goods passing through Delev Market in [[Karov]], providing additional [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to purchase goods.
## Responsibilities
The Tradeholder is expected to embrace and promote trade with the other northern nations. The close contact with the [[Traders|traders]] allows ample [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for the Tradeholder to acquire supplies at bargain prices. To a lesser degree, the Kalphaheim Tradeholder can be seen as responsible for keeping an eye on trade opportunities across the northern Empire, and ensuring that [[Wintermark]] crafters and smiths are able to take advantage of them.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Kalpaheim Tradeholder]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] traded from the north at a set price. The Tradeholder makes their decision on how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable [[Materials|materials]] easily through Delev market.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost|cost]] to purchase mana crystals increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the mana crystals and the [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] were ''both'' subject to [[Tariffs|tariffs]] when they cross the border with the [[Thule]] nation. During the Autumn Equinox 384YE the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to ratify a treaty which removed [[Sanctions|sanctions]] on the Thule. The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to amend [[Tariffs|tariffs]] on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them free trade which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before [[Sanctions|sanctions]] were imposed.
## [[Appointment]]
