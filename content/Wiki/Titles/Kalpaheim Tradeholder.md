## Overview
The [[Kalpaheim Tradeholder]] is an [[Imperial Title]] aWarded to a [[Wintermark]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in Delev.
In the years since [[Skarsind]] was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the Wintermark focus was more on the routes through the passes into [[Hahnmark]] in the north-east. Over Winter 379YE, work began on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with Torfast Trading Post in Skarsind as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Temeschwar]]; merchant offices in the town of Delev in [[Karov]], a brokerage in [[Hercynia]] known as the Treji [[Wayhouse]], and now a Tradehall in the settlement of Kalpaheim, in Hahnmark.
In Summer 381YE, in response to an [[Opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner joined the Northern Trade Network bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while [[The Empire]] remains at peace with the Thule. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while the Empire remains at peace with the Thule.
Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the Forests of Metri threatened to sever Temeschwar from the network, leading to instability along the trade routes, reducing the options available to the Tradeholder. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the [[Rod and Shield]] were instructed to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  disruption to trade end.
During the Summer of 385YE, following the construction of the Temeschwar-Otkodov Mana Exchange far more traders from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead. The completion of the Iron Roads saw an influx of Varushkan trade goods passing through Delev Market in Karov, providing additional opportunities to purchase goods.
## Responsibilities
The Tradeholder is expected to embrace and promote trade with the other northern nations. The close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Tradeholder to acquire supplies at bargain prices. To a lesser degree, the Kalphaheim Tradeholder can be seen as responsible for keeping an eye on trade opportunities across the northern Empire, and ensuring that Wintermark crafters and smiths are able to take advantage of them.

As a Ministry, the title of Kalpaheim Tradeholder allows the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials]] traded from the north at a set price. The Tradeholder makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable materials easily through Delev market.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions]] on trade with Otkodov during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the [[Cost]] to purchase mana crystals increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the mana crystals and the tempest jade were ''both'' subject to [[Tariffs]] when they cross the border with the Thule nation. During the Autumn Equinox 384YE the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to ratify a treaty which removed sanctions on the Thule. The Imperial Senate voted to aMend tariffs on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them free trade which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before sanctions were imposed.
