## Overview
The [[Kalpaheim Tradeholder]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a [[Wintermark]] citizen. It is part of the [[Northern trade network]] which effectively came into being shortly before the Autumn Equinox 380YE, with the construction of the offices of the [[Overseer of the Westward Road]] in [[Karov#Delev|Delev]].
In the years since Skarsind was recovered, the roads were repaired and some work went towards re-establishing trade, but the Wintermark focus was more on the routes through the passes into Hahnmark in the north-east. Over Winter 379YE, [[The worth of a life#Crossroads of the North|work began]] on restoring a trading network along the northern territories with [[Bonesetter of Torfast Trading Post|Torfast Trading Post]] in [[Skarsind]] as a central hub, and subsidiary offices in [[Temeschwar]]; [[Overseer of the Westward Road|merchant offices]] in the town of [[Karov#Delev|Delev]] in [[Karov]], a brokerage in [[Hercynia]] known as the [[Broker of Treji Wayhouse|Treji Wayhouse]], and now a Tradehall in the settlement of [[Hahnmark#Kalpaheim|Kalpaheim]], in [[Hahnmark]].
In Summer 381YE, in response to an [[Opportunity]] offered by the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]], a new partner [[Construct a road connecting the Thule to the Torfast Trading Post|joined]] the Northern Trade Network bringing valuable crystal mana to the markets of the northern Empire. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while the Empire remains at peace with the [[Thule]]. This crystal mana, of course, remains available only while the Empire remains at peace with the [[Thule]].
Following the Autumn Equinox 384YE, the activities of dreadful heralds in the [[Temeschwar#Metri|forests of Metri]] threatened to sever [[Temeschwar]] from the network, leading to [[Don%27t blame me#Broken Hospitality|instability along the trade routes]], reducing the options available to the Tradeholder. During the Winter Solstice 384YE the Order of the Rod and Shield were [[384YE Winter Solstice Conclave sessions#Concord: Rod and Shield and Metri|instructed]] to go and clear out these heralds which saw the  [[Fade out again#A Disturbing Encounter|disruption]] to trade end.
During the Summer of 385YE, following the [[Construct Temeschwar Otkodov Mana Exchange|construction]] of the [[Keeper of the Tome|Temeschwar-Otkodov Mana Exchange]] far more traders from Otkodov are making the trip to Temeschwar to sell their wares instead. The [[Deep forests and dark hills#Northern Prosperity|completion of the Iron Roads]] saw an influx of [[Varushka|Varushkan]] trade goods passing through [[Overseer of the Westward Road|Delev Market]] in [[Karov]], providing additional opportunities to purchase goods.
## Responsibilities
The Tradeholder is expected to embrace and promote trade with the other northern nations. The close contact with the traders allows ample opportunity for the Tradeholder to acquire supplies at bargain prices. To a lesser degree, the Kalphaheim Tradeholder can be seen as responsible for keeping an eye on trade opportunities across the northern Empire, and ensuring that Wintermark crafters and smiths are able to take advantage of them.

As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Kalpaheim Tradeholder]] allows the holder to purchase quantities of special materials traded from the north at a set price. The Tradeholder makes their decision on how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
The Eastern Trade route represents the ability to buy additional goods from Varushkan traders, and remains available as long as the Iron Roads continue to support the transportation of valuable materials easily through Delev market.
Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] during the Winter Solstice 382YE, the cost to purchase mana crystals increased by roughly two-fifths reflecting the fact that the mana crystals and the tempest jade were ''both'' subject to tariffs when they cross the border with the Thule nation. During the Autumn Equinox 384YE the Imperial Senate voted to [[384YE Autumn Equinox Senate sessions#Amend Trade with the Thule|ratify a treaty]] which removed sanctions on the Thule. The Imperial Senate [[384YE Autumn Equinox Senate sessions#Amend Trade with the Thule II|voted]] to amend tariffs on the Thule during the Autumn Equinox 384YE to grant them [[Tariffs#Free Trade|free trade]] which saw the costs of purchasing from the Thule reduced to the level before sanctions were imposed.
