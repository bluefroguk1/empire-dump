## [[Imperial Bourse]]
The most significant titles in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]] are commonly referred to as [[Bourse]] seats.

For historical reasons the [[Master of the Imperial Mint]] and the [[Castellan of Spiral Castle]] are both considered to be a Bourse seat even though neither are associated with the production of bourse resources any longer.

## Other Titles
There are scores of other Imperial titles - many of which are relatively minor in nature. A [[Sinecure]] or [[Ministry]] might provide a wealthy income but rarely includes any legal powers or significant responsibilities beyond ensuring the safety of the structure that provides the income. 
### Senate [[Appointment]]
These titles are appointed by unanimous decision of the senators of the appropriate nation, or by vote of the Senate if the senators cannot decide. These positions are usually important or relevant for national politics.

### Military Council
These titles are appointed by simple majority of any members of the Military Council who are eligible to vote and are present when the election takes place. A national position appointed by the Military Council follows the same process, but only the generals of that nation are allowed to vote.

### Bourse Auction
Like the more significant Bourse seats, these Imperial titles are elected by [[Auction of the Seats]] - going to the highest bidder. They usually provide the controller with access to a  valuable [[Ministry|ministry]] or a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] that provides [[Herbs|herbs]], mana crystals or other resources which may be available for sale.
#lst:Archive:Current_Imperial_Titles|Bourse_Auction
### [[Tally of the Votes]]
Like national Bourse seats, these Imperial titles are elected by [[Tally of the Votes]] - going to whichever candidate enjoys the most support from citizens of their nation. They usually provide the controller with access to a  valuable ministry or a sinecure that provides herbs, mana crystals or other resources which may be available for sale.

### Conclave [[Declaration]]
These seats are elected by [[Declaration|declaration]] of [[Candidacy]] in the Imperial Conclave. They often provide the recipient with an income of important magical materials of some kind.
#lst:Archive:Current_Imperial_Titles|Declaration_Of_Candidacy
### Synod [[Judgement]]

#lst:Archive:Current_Imperial_Titles|Throne_Appointment
### [[Cardinal]] Appointment

#lst:Archive:Current_Imperial_Titles|Cardinal_Appointment
### Other Methods
These titles are often elected by a national contest of some form. The knight-protectors of [[Dawn]] who win their title by victory in a grand tourney whereas the [[Doyen of the Spires]] must win a vote of their peers. The holders of these titles are often expected to employ the powers of their title in service to their nation where appropriate.
