Title: Overseer of the Cavabianca Dock
aliases:
- Overseer_of_the_Cavabianca_Dock
---
This title became inactive when the [[Asavea|Asaveans]] [[The falling sky#The Freedom Accord|fired]] the docks. 
## Overview
The history of the [[#Cavabianca Dock|Cavabianca Dock]] is convoluted. Their current incarnation was effectively [[Commission|commissioned]] by [[Repair the cargo dock at Caricomare|order]] of the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 381YE, and work was completed shortly before the start of the Summer Solstice of the same year. The first shipments of white granite reached Sarvos shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE, following some quick negotiations with the Asaveans to smooth over a misunderstanding that had lead to the docks being built in the wrong place.. 
The [[Overseer of the Cavabianca Dock]] moderates a [[Ministry]] that allowed for the purchase of white granite from the [[Asavean Archipelago]]. Sadly this ministry is no longer in operation following the declaration of war issued by Asavea in retaliation for the surprise attack on Chalonsio launched by the Liberty Pact. It is impossible to say if trade might resume if the Empire made peace with the Asaveans.
During the Spring Equinox 385YE a force of Asavean warships docked in Sarvos and destroyed the Cavabianca Docks before retreating.
## Responsibilities
The [[Overseer of the Cavabianca Dock]] is expected to ensure that the Asavean families known as the Heraclien and the Ragnabe continue to trade white granite to the Empire. The Overseer would be responsible for dealing with any threats to the [[#Cavabianca Dock|Cavabianca Dock]] - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity]] related to them. The continued operation of the docks, and thus the ministry, requires that relations between the Empire and Asavea remain cordial - the Overseer has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.
## Powers
Total Money SpentProduction
173 crowns5 wains White Granite
461 crowns10 wains White Granite
### Ministry
As a [[Ministry]], the Overseer can purchase quantities of white granite at a set price. The Overseer spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
Following the [[Ratify Liberty Pact|imposition]] of [[Tariffs#Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with the [[Asavean Archipelago]] in Winter 382YE, the cost for purchasing white granite via the docks increased by around a fifth.-->
## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Summer Solstice. The [[Overseer of the Cavabianca Dock]] is appointed by citizens of the League who control [[Business]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the business an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only a League citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
Regarding the Heraclien and Ragnabe
This title has some additional restrictions. The white granite it produces is provided by two allied families of Asavean nobles - the Heraclien and the Ragnabe. In the event relations with these families collapsed, the title would still exist but would not be able to purchase white granite. The ability to operate the ministry would also potentially be compromised in the event that relations between the Imperial Senate and the Asavean Plenum were to sour.
An [[Opportunity]] to improve the docks further has been mentioned. After the docks have been operating successfully for six months, if the [[Ambassador]] requests it, Lady Madrianna will approach the two families about offering an additional five wains â€“ assuming relations with Asavea remain cordial of course. With the dock having been built in Sarvos rather than Oran, however, this opportunity may prove difficult to take advantage of.-->
## Cavabianca Dock
These private docks were built in [[Caricomare]], in the city of [[Sarvos]]. Work [[Construct cargo dock at Caricomare|first began]] on a set of docks dedicated to the import of Asavean white granite in Spring 379YE, as part of an agreement with the powerful Tarqunius family. Precise details are unclear, but the deal apparently fell through. The half-completed docks were then destroyed by the [[Grendel]] [[Orc|orcs]] during [[The sack of Sarvos]]. After the city was [[380YE Summer Solstice winds of war#The Defiance of Sarvos|liberated]], further negotiations took place between the Imperial [[Ambassador to Asavea]] and their counterpart in [[Asavean Archipelago ports#Nemoria|Nemoria]], Lady Madrianna of the Blue Stones.Lady Madrianna negotiated on behalf of two rich but relatively minor Plenum families, the Heraclien and the Ragnabe. A new arrangement was made, to build a dedicated cargo dock at [[Feroz#Oranseri|Oran]] within sight of the [[Feroz#The Temple of Balo and the Black Bull|Temple of Balo and the Black Bull]]. 
Instead, the docks were built in Sarvos, to the chagrin of the Plenum families and Lady Madrianna alike. After tense negotiations, Jarrigk Wegwandelaar (the new [[Ambassador]]) was able to secure a further agreement from the Asaveans. When first discussed, the Asaveans were prepared to offer their white granite at a somewhat lower price - as part of the agreement to sell in Sarvos rather than Oran, the prices were somewhat increased. This reflects the need for the ships carrying the white granite to first call at [[Feroz#The Temple of Balo and the Black Bull|the Temple]] in Feroz on their way to and from Sarvos.
The dock was for the exclusive use of merchants and traders from Cavabianca, a town in the Asavean Archipelago associated with several large quarries and overseen by representatives of the two families. Ships used to bring regular shipments of valuable stone to Caricomare from the Archipelago, and there were several sturdy warehouses as well as several apartments for use by the visiting Asavean captains and their officers. The [[Grendel]] left the Asavean ships and their valuable cargo alone - although they still enjoyed a well-armed warship as escort. These warships rarely came close to land however, and it is likely that they were largely crewed by slaves.
The collapse of diplomatic relations between the Imperial Senate and the Plenum saw fewer ships visiting the docks, until eventually the trade dried up completely following the Asavean declaration of war. During the Spring Equinox 385YE a force of Asavean warships docked in Sarvos and destroyed the Cavabianca Docks before retreating.
