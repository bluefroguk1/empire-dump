## Overview

## Responsibilities
The [[Archivist of the Echoing Obelisk]] is responsible for collecting and recording the names of Imperial citizens who fall in our Wars who do not attend [[Anvil]] but deserve to be remembered with equal virtue. The Archivist has a particular responsibility during the Day of the Dead celebrations; to mark the end of the grand procession at Anvil by calling on all present to spend a moment thinking on the nature of virtue, and what a terrible thing it is to be forgotten. In addition if the Echoing Obelisk was ever threatened it would be the responsibility of the Archivist to deal with those threats.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox. The Archivist of the Echoing Obelisk is appointed by a [[Judgement]] of Appointment in the [[Highguard]] national [[Assembly]].  
The title can be held by any Highguard citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly, the Highguard National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
