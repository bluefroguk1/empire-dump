## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Claw]] is an [[Urizen]] [[Imperial Title]] created following an [[379YE Spring Equinox Announcements by the Crystal Architect#Construct the Caves of the Claw|announcement]] in Autumn 378YE by the [[Crystal Architect of the Spires]]. Expansion of the Caves of the Claw was completed shortly before the 379YE Summer Solstice. 
During the Spring Equinox 380YE, a plague of crystal-eating vermin saw the Senate commission [[Construct Urizen Sinecure Outposts|white granite wards]] to help protect the Claw, which had the unexpected outcome of adding additional production to the sinecure. 
## Responsibilities
The Custodian has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Game items#Mana Crystals|crystal mana]] from the [[#The Caves of the Claw|Caves of the Claw]] in [[Morrow]]. If the Caves were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Custodian to deal with those threats.
## Powers
__TOC__
### Bounty of Mana
The Keeper receives an income of 10 crystal mana each season.
## Appointment
The [[Custodian of the Claw]] is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Urizen citizen. The Custodian has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Urizen [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Caves of the Claw
The [[Morrow#Caves of the Claw|Caves of the Claw]] are a series of deep caves in [[Morrow#Ravion|Ravion]] in [[Morrow]]. They were rediscovered by the [[Minister of Historical Research]] in 378YE, and during the Spring of 379YE were excavated by [[Urizen economic interests|ushabti]] associated with the citadel of Phoenix Reach in [[Morrow]] under the supervision of the [[Crystal Architect of the Spires]]. 
The caves are extremely unwelcoming. They are damp, narrow and claustrophobic, and the walls are jagged and sharp. In many places, it is necessary to crawl through extremely narrow passages - but the journey is definitely worth it.  The open chambers of the Caves of the Claw are lined with rough crystal formations of a deep crimson hue and great beauty. 
In order to encourage the growth of mana crystals a number of mithril focussing mirrors were positioned in precise locations to scatter daylight throughout the network (or as deep into the network as is feasible), and a series of delicate aqueducts have been constructed to ensure the caves stay moist. This increased flow of water and light has ensured that the caves have begun producing usable crystal mana once again.
As a side effect, the excavation work and the new illumination have highlighted the natural beauty of the cave system. [[Urizen Magical Traditions#Stargazers|Stargazers]] and [[Urizen Magical Traditions#Seers|Seers]] have begun visiting the caves to engage in meditation on the nature of the realms of Spring - and to a degree of Summer. Hopefully, these pilgrims will be sensible enough not to interfere with the actual structure of the caves.
The passion of Irulan
Local legends assert that the crystals were not always red; In the distant past, a young woman named Irulan sought to prove her virtue in the hope of impressing a suitor. She sought to reach the far end of the caves - deeper than anyone had travelled before. Her success won her the attention of her love, but she was badly cut by the sharp crystal formations in the process - and her blood stained the crystals to this day.
According to the story, Irulan's arms are marked forever with scars forming the shape of the runes of [[Zorech|Passion]] and [[Rhyv|Blood]]. Of course in the story Irulan apocryphally goes on to become one of the finest Spring realm [[Urizen Magical Traditions#Mages|mages]] in Urizen, and credits her experiences in the Caves with her success and deeper understanding of the Spring realm.
The tale is obviously fanciful - there is no evidence that Irulan was a real woman, for example- but it is diverting nonetheless. A much more likely explanation for the rich colour of the crystals is is that they are tainted with trace [[#Materials#orichalcum|orichalcum]] impurities. The story has been handed down through the generations however - even after the location of the caves themselves were lost - and used to teach young Urizen the importance of harnessing one's passions.
