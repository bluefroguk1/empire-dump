## Overview
The [[Embassy]] to the merchants of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] was commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the  [[Summer]] Solstice 380YE, and work began almost immediately in [[Urizen]]. Built in the port-town of Cargo, in [[Redoubt]], construction was completed in a timely fashion and a small group of ambassadors took residence shortly before the [[Autumn]] Equinox. Unlike other nations, there does not appear to be a single [[Ambassador|ambassador]] - instead representatives of five of the ''bedelaar husibas'' seem to share the residence and the responsibilities of diplomacy with [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Each of these ambassadors has brought their own staff, meaning the [[Embassy|embassy]] is almost certainly quite crowded - which has led to the [[Embassy|embassy]] spilling over into, and dominating, the nearby neighbourhood. 
The [[Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]].
