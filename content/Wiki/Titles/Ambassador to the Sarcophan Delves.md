## Overview
The [[Embassy]] to the merchants of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] was [[Commission|commissioned]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the  [[Construct Sarcophan Delves Embassy|Summer Solstice 380YE]], and work began almost immediately in [[Urizen]]. Built in the port-town of [[Redoubt#Cargo|Cargo]], in [[Redoubt]], construction was completed in a timely fashion and a small group of ambassadors took residence shortly before the Autumn Equinox. Unlike other nations, there does not appear to be a single [[Ambassador|ambassador]] - instead representatives of five of the ''bedelaar husibas'' seem to share the residence and the responsibilities of diplomacy with the Empire. Each of these ambassadors has brought their own staff, meaning the embassy is almost certainly quite crowded - which has led to the embassy spilling over into, and dominating, the nearby neighbourhood. 
The [[Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the Imperial Senate.
