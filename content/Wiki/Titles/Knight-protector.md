## Overview
There are four [[Knight-protector]] titles, one for each season. The champion of each seasonal Grand Tourney is crowned [[Knight-protector]] of that season and serves for a single year. The Knights-protector are expected to help [[Dawn]] deal with the [[Realm|realm]] in question and in particular to be first to stand against any threat that might issue forth from the [[Realm|realm]].
The role of [[Knight-protector]] is an ancient [[Imperial Title]], a Dawnish national position which had long since lapsed into obscurity in the past. While it is common for settlements across [[Dawn]] to host local tourneys, the tradition of a single Grand Tourney to appoint a [[Knight-protector]] each season fell into disuse after the death of [[Emperor Hugh]]. Following the changes to Dawnish senatorial elections in [[Autumn|autumn]] 382YE, the [[Egregores]] restored the tradition, to underscore the importance of victory in the tourney - and to provide a mechanism for nobles to commit their support to the tourney winner should they choose.
## Responsibilities
Each [[Knight-protector|knight-protector]] is expected to help [[Dawn]] deal with the [[Realm|realm]] they represent, and in particular to be first to stand against any threat that might issue forth from the [[Realm|realm]]. They may also be called upon by the [[Egregore|egregore]] to help arrange or marshal a Grand Tourney.
## Powers
### [[Banner]] of the Season
Each Knight-protector receives custody of one of four magical [[Magic|magic]] standards, created by the weavers of [[Weirwater]]. The bearer is expected to protect this unique [[Magic|magic]] item with their life - and to hang it prominently in their tent at [[Anvil]] and in their hall at home where all may see their [[Glory]]. 
Each banner bears an [[Enchantment|enchantment]] that allows a bonded bearer to pass through any portal connected with a [[Regio]] - including the ability to visit the Hall of the Worlds. There is some variance between the specific usage of each banner; notably the [[Summer]] Banner allows a small group to accompany the knight-protector. In addition, the knight-protector is treated by the eternals of the appropriate [[Realm|realm]] as an emissary, and granted certain protections from treachery or violence when treating with them - provided they carry the banner.
## [[Appointment]]
The winner of each seasonal Grand Tourney gains the title of Knight-protector. All Dawnish nobility are eligible to participate in the tourney; yeofolk, however, may not compete. By long tradition of the grand tourney, a blind eye is turned to the participation of [[Knights-errant|knights-errant]], who often take part incognito. The tourney takes the form of a grand melee, the winner being the last participant standing when all others are defeated or have yielded. With help from the [[Troubadours|troubadours]], the champion [[Will|will]] be crowned as that season's knight-protector.
Each Knight-protector is an [[Imperial Title]]. The winner holds the title for a year, so the Knight-protector of [[Winter]] [[Will|will]] reign until the start of the next winter tourney, the Knight-protector of [[Spring]] [[Will|will]] reign until next spring - and so on. A reigning knight may not compete in a grand tourney until a year has passed - they can try to retain their title the following year, but they cannot compete for a different title before then, even if they resign their title or are revoked.
If a character wins the tourney but refuses to take up the position for any reason, then there is no Knight-protector for the coming year. Another legal tourney to elect a knight-protector [[Will|will]] not be held until the normal election date comes round again.
Only one grand tourney is held each season. If a knight-protector dies, steps down, or is revoked, the title remains vacant until the next time the grand tourney would be held. 
The title can be held by a citizen of [[Dawn]]. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Dawn]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
