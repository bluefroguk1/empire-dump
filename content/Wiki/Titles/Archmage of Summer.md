## Overview
[[Archmage]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] bestowed upon a [[Magician|magician]] by the members of the [[Imperial Conclave]]. There are six archmages; one for each of the magical [[Realms|realms]]. They serve as a focal point for ritualists of that [[Realm|realm]], as well as helping to [[Guide|guide]] the use of [[The Conclave|the Conclave]]'s resources. The six archmages match the six realms into which [[Magic|magic]] is divided. Where the influence of a [[Grandmaster]] is primarily political, the archmages are responsible for attending to the magical [[Business|business]] of the [[Conclave]]. They are assumed by [[The Senate|the Senate]], the [[Military Council]], foreign dignitaries and eternals alike to be well-versed in the capabilities and lore of their [[Realm]]. The archmages are often seen as the public faces of the Conclave; they are the individuals most likely to be consulted by other Imperial bodies when they wish to know what magical possibilities exist.
Each [[Archmage|archmage]] is addressed by their title and the name of the [[Realm]] of [[Magic|magic]] they stand for - commonly in the form ''Luke, [[Archmage of Summer]]'' or ''[[Archmage]] Corvus of [[Summer]]''. The title [[Archmage|archmage]] comes originally from [[Urizen]], a development of the title [[Mage|mage]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Archmage of Summer]] is responsible for attending to the magical business of the Conclave, and bears powerful tools to help them do so. They represent [[The Empire|the Empire]] to the eternals of the [[Summer Realm|Summer realm]], and vice versa. They also work with magicians versed in the lore of [[Summer magic]] to expand [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s understanding and power in that [[Realm|realm]], and employ it to the advantage of Imperial citizens.
## Powers
Each [[Archmage|archmage]] position is an [[Imperial Title]] in the Conclave.
### [[Archmage of Summer]]
The [[Archmage of Summer]] has the legal powers common to the Archmages. They can participate in the [[Arcane Colloquium]]; accept a formal parley with Summer eternals; raise a [[Declaration]] of [[Alignment]] for a Summer [[Eternal|eternal]] once each summit; and advise the [[Magistrates|magistrates]] as the recognised master of [[Summer magic]].
### Regalia of Summer
In common with the other archmages, the [[Archmage of Summer]] has legal ownership of three powerful [[Magic Items]] that make up the regalia of the archmage. These include the Staff of Summer which greatly enhances the bearer's prowess with [[Summer ritual]] [[Magic|magic]]; the Crimson Chain of [[Aesh]] that can reduce the magnitude of a Summer [[Ritual|ritual]]; and the Belt of [[The Oak|the Oak]] which can allow multiple covens from the same nation to cooperate in the performance of a single Summer ritual.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Appointment|appointment]], replacement, or removal of the Archmage of Summer is made by [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. A candidate can be presented for the post of archmage only once a season, and the title can be held by any Imperial citizen.
The Archmage of Summer serves until they are replaced by another magician using the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. As a title in the Conclave, an archmage cannot be revoked.

## The Eternals of Summer
The Archmage of Summer is [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s formal representative to the inhabitants of the Summer [[Realm|realm]], and often serves as a go-between when those eternals wish to communicate with [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Most eternals [[Will|will]] treat the archmage as a peer - although that can mean very different things for different eternals. One of the most potent abilities the Archmage of Summer possesses is the power of plenipotentiary, allowing them to communicate with eternals from their realm and potentially arranging a parley. A list of previous plenipotentiary results can be found here
Of all the archmages, the Archmage of Summer may be said to have the most difficult job when dealing with the eternals. The Summer eternals style themselves as powerful monarchs, ruling over shifting domains, and their character is such that they regularly clash with one another. For example, [[Eleonaris]] and [[Cathan Canae]] are bitter rivals, and gaining the support of one can sometimes risk worsening relations with the other. A wise Summer archmage either seeks to avoid being drawn into their conflicts and rivalries, or else commits entirely to one or two of the eternals without caring about the opinions of the others. 
The Archmage of Summer is often in a good position to present declarations of [[Amity and enmity]] to the [[Imperial Conclave|Imperial conclave]] when relations between [[The Empire|the Empire]] and an [[Eternal|eternal]] need to be formalised. Indeed, more than any other [[Imperial Title]], the archmage benefits from staying abreast of the relationships between the inhabitants of the Summer realm and Imperial citizens. The current status of the Summer eternals with an interest in the Empire can be found here.
