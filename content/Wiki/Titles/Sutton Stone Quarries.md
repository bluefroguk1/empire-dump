## Overview
The [[Sutton Stone Quarries]] stands on [[Upwold#The Heath|the Heath]], in the [[The Marches|Marcher]] [[Territory]] of [[Upwold]]. Custodianship of the [[Sutton Stone Quarries]] grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable white granite.
## The Resource
These hardworked quarries are in [[Upwold]] near the border with [[Mournwold]] and within sight of the [[Mournwold#Old Pig|Old Pig]] in the [[Mournwold]]. They have long produced an unusually hard and well wearing creamy-coloured limestone that has become so famed as superb quality building stone that the name of the Quarry itself has become eponymous for all other caches of Sutton Stone that have been found. The limestone is seamed with white granite; while the quarries still produce limestone it is this latter material that the quarries focus on.
The [[Sutton Stone Quarries]] are scattered along the southern borders of Upwold. Since the Mournwold fell to the [[Jotun]] in 349YE, there have been several attempts by the barbarians to seize the quarries for themselves. The last, during 372YE, resulted in significant losses to both the Imperial forces and the Jotun armies battling across the Heath. The Imperial forces successfully drove the Jotun back across the border after six months of vicious fighting, leaving several new barbarian burial mounds along the southern borders. 
## The Bourse Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of white granite which is theirs to do with as they will. If the Sutton Stone Quarries were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Sutton Stone Quarries, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Sutton Stone Quarries comes with a seat on the Imperial Bourse. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of white granite
The Seat has control of a source of white granite and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 23 Imperial wains of white granite every season.
### Appointment
As with all white granite Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the Summer Solstice. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title.
Custodianship of the Sutton Stone Quarries is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
