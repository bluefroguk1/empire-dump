## Overview
The Custodian is an [[Imperial Title]] in the Synod. It grants custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. The position was established by a motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Summer Solstice 378YE. Following some confusion, the [[Appointment]] method of the title was clarified by the Imperial Senate in Summer Solstice 381YE.
## Responsibilities
The [[Custodian of the Imperial [[War]] Memorial]] is responsible for ensuring the good maintenance [[Of The War]] memorial itself. Traditionally, individuals who look after such monuments are called on to speak on behalf of the dead especially during memorial services.
## Powers
### Point of [[Pilgrimage]]
The Custodian receives 6 [[Liao]] and 12 votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. If the custodian is not a priest, these votes could be used in the [[General]] [[Assembly]]. If the custodian is a priest, they can call on these votes in any assembly they already participate in.
## Appointment
The Custodian is a Highborn Appointment made by a [[Judgement]] of the [[Highguard]] National Assembly. This is a national title and can only be held by a Highborn citizen.
As with most sinecures, this appointment has Tenure. The assumption is that the Custodian retains the position until they die or step down. They can be revoked by a lesser majority of the General Assembly, the Assembly of the Nine, or by the Highborn National Assembly.
