## [[The Garden]] of Falling Snow
The Garden is constructed around a series of hot springs in a high-altitude valley in Kalpamark. [[Cerulean Mazzarine|Cerulean mazzarine]] does not prosper in the northern Empire, being more suited to the warmer climes around the [[Bay of Catazar]]. The hot springs, however, provide the warmth required to cultivate large quantities of the [[Herb|herb]]. Still, the delicate plants require regular tending and careful monitoring by a small cadre of predominantly [[Kallavesi]] gardeners, wise in the ways of [[Herb|herb]] lore. They also carefully protect the [[Herb|herb]] gardens from animals drawn to the warmth of the hot springs who might otherwise damage the [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]]. For the most part, though, they have plenty of time to dedicate to personal [[Mystic]] pursuits - indeed parts of the area set aside specifically to allow gardeners and visitors to enjoy open air bathing. Floating in a pool of hot water, watching the snow gently fall, is said to be particularly effective in allowing a [[Mystic|mystic]] to achieve a meditative state.
