## Overview
[[The Garden]] of Falling Snow was Commissioned by a motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] in Summer 379YE. Construction of the Garden of Falling snow was completed shortly before the 379YE Autumn Equinox. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Gatekeeper]] has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of herbs from the Garden of Falling Snow in [[Hahnmark]]. If the Garden were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Gatekeeper to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Cerulean Bounty
__TOC__
The Gatekeeper receives custodianshi of a [[Sinecure]] and receives an income of 12 doses of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]] each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Gatekeeper of Falling Snow]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Wintermark]] Senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the Imperial Senate instead.
The title can be held by a Wintermark citizen. The Gatekeeper has Tenure, and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Wintermark National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## The Garden of Falling Snow
The Garden is constructed around a series of hot springs in a high-altitude valley in Kalpamark. Cerulean mazzarine does not prosper in the northern Empire, being more suited to the Warmer climes around the [[Bay of Catazar]]. The hot springs, however, provide the warmth required to cultivate large quantities of the Herb. Still, the delicate plants require regular tending and careful monitoring by a small cadre of predominantly [[Kallavesi]] gardeners, wise in The Ways of herb lore. They also carefUlly protect the herb gardens from animals drawn to the warmth of the hot springs who might otherwise daMage the cerulean mazzarine. For the most part, though, they have plenty of time to dedicate to personal [[Mystic]] pursuits - indeed parts of the area set aside specifically to allow gardeners and Visitors to enjoy open air bathing. Floating in a pool of hot water, watching the snow gently fall, is said to be particularly effective in allowing a mystic to achieve a meditative state.
