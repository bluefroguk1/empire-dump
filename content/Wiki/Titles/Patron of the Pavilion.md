## Pavilion on Looking Glass Lake
The pavilion has recently been a haven for those wishing to engage in strident debate, especially about the nature of the Eternals and the use of [[Magic]] in [[The Empire]]. Following the [[Curse]] that has Warped the surrounding [[Landscape]], the pavilion has become the centre of an inspirational [[Aura]] that enCourages Visitors to "''think of the actions that made them who they are, and to consider the actions necessary to become the person they want to be''". There is no obvious source for the aura - which appears to be spiritual in nature. The students, virtuous pilgrims, and others who visit the pavilion now look to the ''[[Bishop]] of Looking Glass Lake'' for advice and guidance on matters of virtue.
