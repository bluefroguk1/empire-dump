## Overview
[[Custodian of the Bleak Tower]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that oversees a [[Great work]] in [[Morrow]]. The tower was commissioned in [[Summer]] 382YE as part of an [[Opportunity]] presented during the [[Spring]] Equinox. Work was completed shortly before the Summer Solstice 383YE.
## Responsibilities
The Custodian is responsible for ensuring the Bleak Tower, and the [[Spire|spire]] that tends to it, remains unthreatened and continues to share its expertise with the herbalists of [[Morrow]]. They further ensure that the unique nature of the Tower is not threatened - that its carefully cultivated [[Aura|aura]] of [[Ruin|ruin]] is not damaged, as this would lead to the loss of the valuable sap gathered from the trees that grow within the [[Regio]]. Preserving the [[Regio|regio]], of course, is also part of the Custodian's responsibilities.
## Powers
### Heart's Blood
The [[Custodian of the Bleak Tower]] gains custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. They receive an income of 6 Heart's Blood each season.
### [[Great work|Great Work]]
The Bleak Tower is a Great work, which distributes a share of 80 random [[Herbs|herbs]] to all citizens of Morrow who own [[Herb|herb]] gardens. The Custodian has no control over this element, which operates automatically each season.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The Custodian of the Bleak Tower selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any [[Urizen]] citizen. The Custodian has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Urizen [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Bleak Tower
During their invasion of [[Zenith]], the [[Druj]] destroyed the Gardens of [[Pallas]] in central Iteri. The gardens were flooded, their ushabti smashed, their caretaker [[Spires|spires]] burned. Their malice knew no bounds - during their invasion of Morrow they also destroyed the beautiful Gardens at Caeli. But among the refugees in Morrow the expertise remained - and to those with eyes to see, this created an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to salvage something out of this disaster. With the approval of [[The Senate|the Senate]], a [[Commission|commission]] was created to harness that displayed expertise.
The Bleak Tower was an ancient structure, long abandoned for reasons unknown. Half collapsed, it once housed a vast arboretum. The buildings lay in ruins, and the trees had grown wild. Yet that slow [[Ruin|ruin]] brought with it a gathering of [[Winter]] resonance that eventually gave rise to a potent Regio - one with some unusual benefits. Cyrus of the White Stair, formerly of [[Zenith]], suggested that restoration of the tower would allow a new [[Spire|spire]] to be built, one that could provide a home for refugees from the Gardens of [[Pallas]] - and for those displaced from the Gardens of Morrow. 
Work to restore the spire required careful planning - the arboretum needed to be restored without losing the overwhelming sense of ruination that gave rise to the regio. With great care the ruin was made habitable - and skilled herbalists among the refugees encouraged to establish a new spire around it. From the Bleak Tower, the herbalists are able to collaborate with their peers across Morrow, exchanging seeds and plants as well as [[Skills|skills]] and expertise, bringing great gains to the [[Herb|herb]] gardens of the Urizen [[Territory|territory]].
The real gain comes from the restored arboretum itself however. The twisted trees that grow near the regio produce sap that is a sticky dark red in colour with a metallic tang. It is more than just a mere curio however, it is potent with [[Magic|magic]] - a rare form of Heart's Blood - invaluable for winter [[Rituals|rituals]]. It requires careful tending, but the Custodian is able to claim a bounty of this potent [[Vis|vis]] each season.
