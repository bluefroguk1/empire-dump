## Overview
The [[Raven Seer]] is an [[Imperial Title]] aWarded to a citizen of [[Wintermark]]. It is a national position appointed by unanimous decision of the Wintermark Senators.
The Aviary of Ishal was reconstructed following a motion in the Senate, proposed by the [[Senator]] for [[Kallavesa]]. The Aviary is in southern Skymark, the furthest of the three settlements round the lake at the heart of Kallavesa. According to the tales of the scops, this is where the wise go to read the future in the flight of [[Birds]] and the night skies. Itâ€™s a place for learning - of the future and of yourself. For many years the mystics of Ishal have studied the omens and worked together to decipher them.

### Infusions of the Mystics
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Raven Seer  allows the holder to purchase infusions at a set price. The Seer spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and infusions are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
### Bounty of Goosewhisper
The Raven Seer receives a bounty of five doses of Goosewhisper Infusion each season to use as they see fit.
### Parliament of Owls
The Raven Seer is the custodian of the ritual text for the ''Parliament of Owls'', a ritual codified during the reign of [[Emperor Nicovar]]. The ritual allows the Raven Seer to communicate a question to the mystics of Ishal. If the mystics are asked an appropriate question, if they are asked to look into some issue of current affairs that affects Wintermark, then they will study the omens and report what they can find on the matter to the Raven Seer. There is only one copy of this ritual text; the Raven Seer is expected to hand it to their successor.
## [[Appointment]]
The Raven Seer is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. It is chosen by unanimous decision of the senators of Wintermark. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Wintermark citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Wintermark National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
The mystics of Ishal have made clear that they would prefer the Raven Seer be a [[Mystic]] of the [[Kallavesi]] tradition, trusting to the Wintermark senators to ensure that this is the case.
