## Appointment
The Wisdom of the Tenebrous Path is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. It is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Navarr]] [[General|generals]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Military Council]] instead.
The title can be held by any Navarr citizen. The Wisdom serves until the next scheduled election. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Navarr [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Tenebrous Path
The Tenebrous Path is made up of eight small halls clustered in a glade of young oak trees.  The main hall is larger than the others and primarily serves to welcome and introduce new visitors. At one end of the hall there is a statue of a [[Changeling]] with a small plaque bearing the following "''Our oaths are our choice, given freely to walk the shadowed road to whatever end. Let your oath stand testimony to all that you are. A thorn once, always, until the very end.''" Each of the other halls serve as an academy dedicated to the study and understanding of warfare, with experienced [[Thorn|thorns]] and [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|vates]] on hand to offer advice and guidance. 
The mana crystals that form in the [[Mithril]] bowls of the Tenebrous Path are noted for their rich crimson colouration, which some [[Navarr religious beliefs|guides]] suggest should serve as a reminder for the cost of blood in war.
