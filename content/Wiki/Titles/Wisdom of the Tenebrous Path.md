## Overview

## The Tenebrous Path
The Tenebrous Path is made up of eight small halls clustered in a glade of young oak trees.  The main hall is larger than the others and primarily serves to welcome and introduce new visitors. At one end of the hall there is a statue of a [[Changeling]] with a small plaque bearing the following "''Our oaths are [[Our choice|our choice]], given freely to walk the shadowed road to whatever end. Let your oath stand [[Testimony|testimony]] to all that you are. A [[Thorn|thorn]] once, always, until the very end.''" Each of the other halls serve as an academy dedicated to the study and understanding of warfare, with experienced thorns and vates on hand to offer advice and guidance. 
The mana crystals that form in the [[Mithril]] bowls of the Tenebrous Path are noted for their rich crimson colouration, which some guides suggest should serve as a reminder for the [[Cost|cost]] of blood in [[War|war]].
