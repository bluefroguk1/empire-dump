__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Polemarch of Highwatch]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]], created in [[384YE Summer Solstice Senate sessions#Highwatch Citadel|Summer 384YE]].  It grants custodianship of the sinecure known as [[#Highwatch Citadel|Highwatch Citadel]], an historical site located in [[Morrow#Altis|Altis]], [[Morrow]], after the sentinels there arranged an accord with the Eternal [[Zakalwe]].
## Responsibilities
The Polemarch has no particular responsibilities, they simply receive an income of useful items from the heralds of Zakalwe. If Highwatch Citadel were ever to come under threat, it would be the responsibility of the Polemarch to deal with this threat.
## Powers
### Infusions of Day
Each season the Polemarch receives 3 doses of [[Effulgent Primessence]], provided by the heralds of Zakalwe. These potions can be used by practitioners of [[Day magic]] to enhance their ability to perform rituals.
These potions are not produced in the Citadel, they are provided by the heralds of Zakalwe. If relations with the Master Strategist were to decline severely, these heralds would depart and the Polemarch would no longer receive their income.
### Pearls of Manush
Each season, the [[General]] of Day provides the Polemarch with a single ''Pearl of Manush''. 
Each Pearl is taken from a cove in the Day realm, where all manner of exotic shells are found. The waters of Manush are clotted with thoughts that drift on the whispering tides. Sometimes one of these thoughts will be caught inside the flesh of one of the great clams that dwells there and as the years go by the idea is coated with ever more layers of mother of pearl. A powerful Day magician can drain the power of a pearl of Manush by invoking it while performing the ritual [[Clarity of the Master Strategist]]. The pearl provides up to five additional ranks of Day lore for the magician using it, subject to the [[Realm Lore#Gaining additional ranks|normal rules for effective skill]]. It also counts as up to ten mana crystals used by the magician that invokes the Pearl. Once used the pearl's power is spent.
As part of the agreement with Zakalwe, these Pearls are only to be used in the Empire's war against the [[Druj]]. If a Pearl was ever used to enchant an army facing the [[Jotun]] or any other enemy, the heralds resident in the Citadel would abandon their chambers and no further Pearls would be forthcoming. Similarly, if Zakalwe were to be the subject of [[Amity and enmity#Declaration of Enmity|enmity]], the heralds would be forced to return to the realm of Day.
## Appointment
The [[Polemarch of Highwatch]] is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. It is chosen by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Urizen citizen. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Urizen [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## Highwatch Citadel
Highwatch Citadel is hundreds of years old; the [[Spire#Citadels|citadel]] is where the Urizen met [[Emperor Giovanni|Giovanni the Peacemaker]] to negotiate their incorporation into the Empire. The citadel dominates one of the tallest peaks of [[Morrow#Altis|Altis]] and the pattern of [[Trod|trods]] in [[Therunin#Peakedge Song|Peakedge Song]] are visible on the clearest of days. Following the expansion commissioned by the Imperial Senate there are now a number of heralds of the Master Strategist who spend their time debating matters of strategy and warfare with those visitors.
