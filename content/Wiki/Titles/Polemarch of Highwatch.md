__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Polemarch of Highwatch]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by [[The Senate|the Senate]], created in [[Summer]] 384YE.  It grants custodianship of the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] known as Highwatch Citadel, an historical site located in Altis, [[Morrow]], after the sentinels there arranged an accord with the [[Eternal]] [[Zakalwe]].
## Responsibilities
The Polemarch has no particular responsibilities, they simply receive an income of useful items from the heralds of [[Zakalwe]]. If Highwatch Citadel were ever to come under threat, it would be the responsibility of the Polemarch to deal with this threat.
## Powers
### Infusions of [[Day]]
Each season the Polemarch receives 3 doses of [[Effulgent Primessence]], provided by the heralds of [[Zakalwe]]. These potions can be used by practitioners of [[Day magic]] to enhance their ability to perform [[Rituals|rituals]].
These potions are not produced in the Citadel, they are provided by the heralds of [[Zakalwe]]. If relations with the Master Strategist were to decline severely, these heralds would depart and the Polemarch would no longer receive their income.
### Pearls of Manush
Each season, the [[General]] of Day provides the Polemarch with a single ''Pearl of Manush''. 
Each Pearl is taken from a cove in the Day [[Realm|realm]], where all manner of exotic shells are found. The waters of Manush are clotted with thoughts that drift on the whispering tides. Sometimes one of these thoughts [[Will|will]] be caught inside the flesh of one of the great clams that dwells there and as the years go by the idea is coated with ever more layers of mother of pearl. A powerful Day [[Magician|magician]] can drain the power of a pearl of Manush by invoking it while performing the [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Clarity of the Master Strategist]]. The pearl provides up to five additional ranks of Day lore for the magician using it, subject to the normal rules for effective skill. It also counts as up to ten mana crystals used by the magician that invokes the Pearl. Once used the pearl's power is spent.
As part of the agreement with [[Zakalwe]], these Pearls are only to be used in [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s [[War|war]] against the [[Druj]]. If a Pearl was ever used to enchant an army facing the [[Jotun]] or any other enemy, the heralds resident in the Citadel would abandon their chambers and no further Pearls would be forthcoming. Similarly, if Zakalwe were to be the subject of enmity, the heralds would be forced to return to the [[Realm|realm]] of Day.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Polemarch of Highwatch]] is appointed during the [[Autumn]] Equinox each year. It is chosen by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any [[Urizen]] citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Urizen]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Highwatch Citadel
Highwatch Citadel is hundreds of years old; the citadel is where the [[Urizen]] met Giovanni the Peacemaker to negotiate their incorporation into [[The Empire|the Empire]]. The citadel dominates one of the tallest peaks of Altis and the pattern of [[Trods|trods]] in Peakedge Song are visible on the clearest of days. Following the expansion commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] there are now a number of heralds of the Master Strategist who spend their time debating matters of strategy and warfare with those visitors.
