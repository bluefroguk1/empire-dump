So, to summarize Master, we've no bloody money, no bloody mithril, and no bloody hope of getting any? Right - I move we pass the motion anyway. I don't give two shits where the ruddy Freeborn get the Mithril from. You don't plough another person's field.
## Overview
The [[Master of the Imperial Mint]] is based in [[Tassato]] and has ceremonial responsibility for producing all Imperial coinage and protecting it against forgers. The position of Master of the Mint comes with an opulent apartment in Tassato overlooking the river as well as a position on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. By tradition the Master is able to address the [[Imperial Senate]] at their own behest or on the instruction of the Bourse.
This Bourse position is reserved for a citizen of [[The League]] who presents the largest bid. Part of the payment is used to pay for the expenses incurred in running the mint, the remainder is taken by the Senate treasury. It does not produce any material wealth, but many a skilful occupant has found ways to turn a cheap seat on the Bourse to a profit.
## Responsibilities
The title was created during the reign of [[Emperor Giovanni]], under the direct sponsorship of [[The Throne]]. Giovanni saw the title as a vital go-between for the Bourse and the Senate, able to keep both groups appraised of important matters. While this may have been the intent, when the title was created it was given no specific responsibilities. Some Masters favour the Bourse, while others attempt to convince their fellow seat holders to cooperate with the Senate rather than pursue pure profit. Most walk a fine line between houses, however, avoiding becoming too tied to one or the other. Many see the relative freedom of the Master as a necessary component of the office - and as the seat cannot be revoked, it tends to be somewhat moot.
