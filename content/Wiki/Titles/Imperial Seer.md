## Overview
The [[Imperial Seer]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the [[Autumn]] Equinox 379YE. It is appointed through the [[Imperial Conclave]]. They are responsible for coordinating the use of divination [[Magic|magic]] by the magicians of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. The title was amended by [[The Senate|the Senate]] during the [[Winter]] Solstice 384YE to grant it a stipend from the [[Imperial treasury]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Seer]] is responsible for coordinating the use of divination [[Magic|magic]] by Imperial magicians. While this most obviously involves ensuring that [[The Empire|the Empire]] is making the best use of [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Eyes of the Sun and Moon]], The [[Eye of the High Places]], and [[Dreams in the Witch House]], the title has potentially broader implications. "Divination magic" would also cover the use of [[Rituals|rituals]] such as the potentially valuable visions provided by [[Signs and Portents]], [[Whispering Shadow Courtiers]], or the consumption of [[Goosewhisper Infusion]]. It might also cover gathering historical information of note through [[Skein of Years]], communion with eternals through powers such as Swim [[Leviathan]]'s Depth or [[Clear Counsel of the Everflowing River]], and the coordination of magicians who work with the [[Magistrates]] and Imperial militia to uncover information vital to [[Law|law]] enforcement.
## Powers
### Address the [[Senate]]
The [[Imperial Seer]] has the right to make an address to the Senate once per summit. This allows them to present important information for the Senators consideration. To use this power, the [[Seer]] informs the Civil Service that they wish to address the Senate. Their address [[Will|will]] be added to the agenda for the next [[Senate session]].
### Address the Council
The Imperial Seer has the right to make an address to the [[Imperial Military Council]] once per summit. To use this power, the Seer informs the [[Herald of the Council]] that they wish to make an address, which [[Will|will]] then be added to the agenda for the next [[Council session]].
### Custodian of ''The Hawk's Demeanour''
Following the appearance of a powerful magical shroud covering the entire Empire in Winter 380YE, an obscure [[Coven|coven]] based in Wittal Grove known as the Augurs of the Opalescent Gloaming presented the Imperial Seer with a unique magical [[Ritual|ritual]] mask called the ''The Hawk's Demeanour''. This artefactual [[Strigine Mask]] is possessed of an additional power that allows the bonded wearer to employ [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] in place of crystal mana when performing [[Eyes of the Sun and Moon]] or [[Eye of the High Places]]. The mask is legally part of the regalia of the Imperial Seer. When the [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] changes hands the item should be given to the new Imperial Seer with all appropriate haste.
### Waters of the Shimmering Shore
The Augurs of the Opalescent Gloaming have also committed to providing the Imperial Seer with two doses of a magical liquid they call "Waters of the Shimmering Shore" each season. This translucent magical substance can [[Empower|empower]] a divination ritual to penetrate the power of magical shrouds (although interestingly not to rituals such as [[Piercing Light of Revelation]] that do not by their nature gather information). Details of its provenance are not common knowledge, but it is believed to be drawn from the [[Day]] [[Realm|realm]], possibly as a consequence of an agreement with an [[Eternal]].
### Stipend
The Imperial Seer receives a stipend of 40 thrones each season from the [[Imperial treasury]]
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Appointment|appointment]], replacement, or removal of the Imperial Seer is made by the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. The Seer serves until they are replaced by another [[Magician|magician]] using the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. As a title in [[The Conclave|the Conclave]], they cannot be revoked.
