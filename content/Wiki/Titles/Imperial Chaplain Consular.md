## Overview
The [[Imperial Chaplain Consular]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the [[Cardinal of the Way]]. The title was [[Create title of Imperial Chaplain Consular|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Spring Equinox summit of 379YE.
The first [[Imperial Chaplain Consular]] was Hywel Summercrow of [[Navarr]], appointed in Spring 379YE by [[Cardinal]] Bishop Beodun Snowlock of [[Wintermark]]. The decision has prompted some speculation that the Cardinals of the Way intend to follow the traditions surrounding the [[Conscience of the Senate]] - specifically that it is customary to select a candidate from a nation other than that of the [[Cardinal]].
When it was created, The [[Imperial Chaplain Consular]] had the power to withdraw funds directly from the [[Rewarding|virtue fund]]. Shortly before the Summer Solstive 385YE, however, the Constitutional Court ruled that the [[Rings and crowns#Virtue and Reward|ability to withdraw funds directly from the virtue fund was unconstitutional]], and struck the power down.
==Responsibilities== 
The Chaplain Consular has three main responsibilities. They are expected to advise Imperial Ambassadors on matters pertaining to [[The Way]] - to offer them theological guidance and spiritual counsel in their dealings with foreign nations. They are to provide oversight of Imperial Ambassadors for the Synod - to ensure that the representatives of the Empire are free from [[Religious Crimes#Heresy|heresy]], and do not become seduced by the strange ways of foreign nations. Finally, they are expected to study foreign religions, and to share their conclusions in order to facilitate comparative theology.

## Powers
### Inquisit Imperial [[Ambassador]]
Once per summit, the Imperial Chaplain Consular may call an [[Inquisition]] against an Imperial [[Ambassador]] without the need for a vote in the Synod. This is in addition to any existing judgements they have raised normally. This use of the power may be escalated to [[Sanction]] just like any other [[Inquisition]]. To use this power, the Imperial Chaplain Consular must still place a judgement before the Synod, but it is considered to pass automatically at the point it is presented.
## Appointment
The Chaplain Consular is appointed by the [[Cardinal]] of the Way, during the Spring Equinox. 
Any Imperial citizen may hold the title. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]] or the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Assembly of the Way]].
