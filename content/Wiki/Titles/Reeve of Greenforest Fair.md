As a Ministry, the title of Reeve of Greenforest Fair allows the holder to purchase measures at a set price. The Reeve spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
SuitabilityThe Reeve of the Greenforest Fair is intended to be held by a yeofolk, the task of haggling over coins and measures is unsuitable for a noble. If the title is held by a character who is a noble, or they become one during their tenure, then the player must email admin@profounddecisions.co.uk to let us know to turn off production of the ministry.
