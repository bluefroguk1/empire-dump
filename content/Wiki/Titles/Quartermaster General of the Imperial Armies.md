## Overview
This title was [[Create title of Quartermaster General of the Imperial Armies|created]] at the Autumn Equinox summit of 377YE, and Janusz Dalibor von Temeschwar of the Bloody Butchers of [[Temeschwar]] appointed to the position by the Senate.
During the Spring Equinox 378YE, the Quartermaster's powers were significantly [[Amend Powers of the Quartermaster General#Spring 378YE|amended]]. The stipend (originally set at 25 thrones each season) was suspended, and their right to [[Senator#Right to Speak|speak]] in the Senate was removed and replaced with the right of address. 
In Summer 380YE, the Imperial Senate voted to further amend the powers [[Amend Powers of the Quartermaster General II|amend the powers]] of the Quartermaster [[General]] to allow them to [[#Apportioning the Guerdon|apportion]] the [[Military unit#Imperial Guerdon|Imperial Guerdon]]. This new power underwent significant [[Scrutiny]] by the [[Scrutiny#Constitutional Court|constitutional court]], and they [[Amend Powers of the Quartermaster General II#Scrutiny|identified]] that it represented a significant shift in power ''from'' individual nations and their [[General|generals]] ''to'' the [[Imperial Military Council]]. As such, it required both a [[Senate motion#Constitutional Vote|constitutional vote]] and [[The Throne#Ratification|ratification]] by [[The Throne]]. 
The motion passed, and was ratified by [[Empress Lisabetta]], granting the Quartermaster [[General]] sweeping powers to influence how the independent captains of the Empire would support Imperial military forces in future. The constitutional court also recommended that the method of appointment be changed to reflect the fact that the Quartermaster [[General]] was an officer of the Military Council, and not the Senate. This duly passed and the old method of appointment - using a shortlist drawn up by the generals and then voted on by the Senate - was abandoned in favour of majority decision by the military council.
## Responsibilities
The Quartermaster General is expected to take responsibility for the logistics of the [[Imperial armies|Empire's armies]]. They may be called upon to advise the Senate on the needs of the armies, so that they may best pass motions for the resupply, development or building of armies and fortifications. They are expected to acquire resources swiftly and efficiently, and to liaise between the Senate and Military Council on logistical matters.
Following [[Responsibility for respectful silence|a recent decision]] of the [[Imperial Senate]], the responsibilities of the Quartermaster include calling for a moment of silence to honour the dead after any [[Casualties#Emergency Resupply|address for emergency resupply]] is announced.
## Powers
### Address the Senate
The Quartermaster General has the right to make an address to the Senate once per summit. This is intended to allow them to present important information for the Senators consideration. It is extremely impolite not to inform the Speaker's seat of your intention to make this Address in advance of a session.
### Address the Council
The Quartermaster General has the right to make a [[Council address|address]] to the [[Imperial Military Council]] once per summit. This is intended to allow them to discuss matters of resupply with the Council. To use this power, the Quartermaster General informs the [[Herald of the Council]] that they wish to make an address, which will then  be added to the agenda for the next [[Council session]].
### Resupply Imperial armies
The Quartermaster General has the power to [[Casualties#Emergency Resupply|resupply Imperial armies.]]
To use this power, the Quartermaster General provides an [[Senate announcement|announcement]] to the Civil Service, who present the decision to the [[Imperial Senate]]. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Quartermaster General. This resupply follows the same rules as if it had been announced as part of a Senate motion. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over the Quartermaster's decision. The specifics of the armies to be resupplied will be provided to the Herald of the Military Council prior to the announcement in Senate.
### Apportioning the Guerdon
The Quartermaster General has the power to determine how the [[Military unit#Imperial Guerdon|Imperial Guerdon]] is allocated. Specifically, they can exclude any or all [[Imperial army|Imperial armies]] and [[Imperial navy|navies]], [[Fortification|fortifications]], or [[Military unit#Assisting a Special Project|special projects]] (such as [[Spy network|spy networks]]) from the calculations. This means that a [[Military unit]] (or [[Fleet]]) will receive a share of the guerdon only for [[Military unit#Supporting an Army|supporting]] an army (or [[Fleet#Supporting a Navy|navy]]), [[Military unit#Defending a Fortification|defending]] a fortification, or [[Military unit#Assisting a Special Project|assisting]] a special project that has been approved by the Imperial Quartermaster. Once the Imperial Quartermaster apportions the Guerdon, their decision remains in effect until it is changed again.
If an army, fortification, or special project is excluded from the Guerdon then military units that support it receive no shares of the Guerdon and are not counted in the calculations to determine how it will be allocated. In essence, those military units receive ''nothing''. Regardless, the Imperial Quartermaster has no power to add things that would not normally be eligible for the Guerdon to the list - a foreign army for example, or a fortification that is not controlled by the Empire.
As with the ability to [[#Resupply Imperial armies|power of resupply]], the Quartermaster General provides an announcement to the Civil Service which is presented to the Senate, and may be vetoed by the Imperial Synod. The specifics of the armies to receive the Guerdon will be provided to the Herald of the Military Council prior to the announcement in Senate.
