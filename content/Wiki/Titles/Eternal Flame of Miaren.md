## Overview
[[Eternal Flame of Miaren]] is a [[Navarr]] [[Imperial Title]] created following an announcement in [[Winter]] 380YE by the [[Civilian Commissioner]]. [[The Chamber]] of the Flame was completed shortly before the 381YE [[Spring]] Equinox. The position of [[Eternal]] Flame is a [[Sinecure]] in [[Miaren]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Eternal]] Flame has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of mana crystals from [[The Chamber|the Chamber]] of the Flame. If [[The Chamber|the Chamber]] itself were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the [[Eternal Flame of Miaren]] to deal with those threats  - but also to deal with any [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to expand the [[Sinecure|sinecure]], or to make any decisions about its operation.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The [[Eternal]] Flame has custodianship of a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] and receives an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Eternal]] Flame of [[Miaren]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Navarr]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a [[Navarr]] citizen. The Flame has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Navarr]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Chamber of the Flame
Amid the ruins of the fallen Terunael city of Seren, in Serenael, lies the beauty and wonder of a new, [[Navarr]], city. During some recent explorations of an area on the outskirts, a hidden cave was located behind a waterfall on the northern-western side of the old city. Further investigation discovered an eerie flame glowing in the cave, one that gave of a dim, pleasant illumination by no amount of heat. Some scholars are already suggesting it might in some way be tied to rumours of a "[[Golden Sun|golden sun]]" in the lost Terunael city of Emrys.
With the careful positioning of [[Mithril|mithril]] mirrors, the light of the cool flame has been refocused into the pool of water that occupies the southern third of the cave, and a bounty of crystal mana has been gathered from its depths.
