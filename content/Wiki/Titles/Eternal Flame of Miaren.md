## Overview
[[Eternal Flame of Miaren]] is a [[Navarr]] [[Imperial Title]] created following an [[Construct the Eternal Flame of Miaren|announcement]] in Winter 380YE by the [[Civilian Commissioner]]. The [[#Chamber of the Flame|Chamber of the Flame]] was completed shortly before the 381YE Spring Equinox. The position of Eternal Flame is a [[Sinecure]] in [[Miaren]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities
The Eternal Flame has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Game items#Mana Crystals|mana crystals]] from the [[#Chamber of the Flame|Chamber of the Flame]]. If the Chamber itself were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the [[Eternal Flame of Miaren]] to deal with those threats  - but also to deal with any opportunity to expand the sinecure, or to make any decisions about its operation.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Eternal Flame has custodianship of a sinecure and receives an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
## Appointment
The [[Eternal Flame of Miaren]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Navarr]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a Navarr citizen. The Flame has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Navarr [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## Chamber of the Flame
Amid the ruins of the fallen Terunael city of [[Miaren#Seren|Seren]], in [[Miaren#Serenael|Serenael]], lies the beauty and wonder of a new, Navarr, city. During some recent explorations of an area on the outskirts, a hidden cave was located behind a waterfall on the northern-western side of the old city. Further investigation discovered an eerie flame glowing in the cave, one that gave of a dim, pleasant illumination by no amount of heat. Some scholars are already suggesting it might in some way be tied to rumours of a "golden sun" in the lost Terunael city of Emrys.
With the careful positioning of mithril mirrors, the light of the cool flame has been refocused into the pool of water that occupies the southern third of the cave, and a bounty of crystal mana has been gathered from its depths.
