## Overview
The position was [[Create title of Seer of the Gateway|established]] by the Senate at the Winter Solstice summit of 379YE. The [[Seer of the Gateway]] exists to ensure the safety, and record the experiences, of citizens returning from a past life vision.
The first [[Seer of the Gateway]] was Livia of the Spire of the Celestial Cascade of [[Urizen]], appointed in Winter 379YE by the Assembly of the Nine. No other candidates were considered. Livia is a skilled Torchbearer with years of experience helping visionaries to recall every last detail of their vision, as well as dealing with the side-effects of the process. Even before being appointed to the title, she would often approach visionaries to ask for permission before their vision, and wait for them to emerge afterwards. 
When it was created, The [[Seer of the Gateway]] had the power to withdraw funds directly from the [[Rewarding|virtue fund]]. Shortly before the Summer Solstive 385YE, however, the Constitutional Court ruled that the [[Rings and crowns#Virtue and Reward|ability to withdraw funds directly from the virtue fund was unconstitutional]], and struck the power down.

## Publication
In the Spring of 380YE Livia struck a publication deal with the Spider's Vantage Spire of Redoubt, who published her accounts of visionaries' experiences across the Empire. You can find the existing ''Echoes of the Labyrinth'' texts below; the Spider's Vantage Spire have let it be known that they intend to publish more after each Anvil summit.
During the Summer Solstice 382YE, the Senate agreed to [[Disseminate True Liao visions|fund the distribution]] of Echoes of the Labyrinth to foreign nations - or at least to the nations the Empire trades with. Some foreign nations have received the volumes enthusiastically, some a little less so. Details of the somewhat mixed response can be found [[Disseminate True Liao visions#Distribution|here]].
