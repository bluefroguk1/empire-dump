## Overview
The position was established by [[The Senate|the Senate]] at the [[Winter]] Solstice summit of 379YE. The [[Seer of the Gateway]] exists to ensure the safety, and record the experiences, of citizens returning from a [[Past life vision|past life vision]].
The first [[Seer]] of the Gateway was Livia of the [[Spire]] of the Celestial Cascade of [[Urizen]], appointed in Winter 379YE by the [[Assembly]] of the Nine. No other candidates were considered. Livia is a skilled [[Torchbearer]] with years of experience helping visionaries to recall every last detail of their vision, as well as dealing with the side-effects of the process. Even before being appointed to the title, she would often approach visionaries to ask for permission before their vision, and wait for them to emerge afterwards. 
When it was created, The [[Seer of the Gateway]] had the power to withdraw funds directly from the virtue fund. Shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstive 385YE, however, the Constitutional Court ruled that the ability to withdraw funds directly from the virtue fund was unconstitutional, and struck the power down.
==Responsibilities== 
The [[Seer]] of the Gateway has four main responsibilities. Firstly, to safeguard the well-being of visionaries and [[Guide|guide]] priests partaking in True [[Liao]]. They are also expected to record the visions, and experiences, of visionaries and guide priests, as well as to publish and disseminate their records and any conclusions. Finally, they are expected to be able to purchase [[Liao]] and other paraphernalia in support of their duties. 
## Powers
### Stipend
The Seer of the Gateway receives a stipend of 2 Thrones each season from the [[Imperial treasury|Imperial Treasury]].
__TOC__
### Publication
The Seer of the Gateway is expected to compile and publish accounts of Imperial [[True liao|True Liao]] vision. During the Summer Solstice 382YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] agreed to pay to distribute copies of these documents to every foreign nation with which [[The Empire|the Empire]] trades. This decision was amended to exclude the [[Iron Confederacy]].
## [[Appointment]]
The Seer of the Gateway is appointed by [[Judgement]] of the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
Any Imperial citizen may hold the title. The Seer has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## Publication
In the [[Spring]] of 380YE Livia struck a publication deal with [[The Spider|the Spider]]'s Vantage [[Spire]] of [[Redoubt]], who published her accounts of visionaries' experiences across [[The Empire|the Empire]]. You can find the existing ''Echoes of the Labyrinth'' texts below; the Spider's Vantage Spire have let it be known that they intend to publish more after each [[Anvil]] summit.
During the Summer Solstice 382YE, the [[Senate]] agreed to fund the distribution of Echoes of the Labyrinth to [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]] - or at least to [[The Nations|the nations]] the Empire trades with. Some [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]] have received the volumes enthusiastically, some a little less so. Details of the somewhat mixed response can be found here.
