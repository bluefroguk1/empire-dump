## Overview
The [[Ambassador]] to the [[Thule]] orcs of [[Otkodov]] is an [[Imperial Title]] It is an Imperial position appointed by [[The Senate|the Senate]].
Work on an [[Embassy|embassy]] for the [[Thule]] orcs was commissioned in [[Summer]] 381YE by order of the [[Imperial Senate]], and completed just before the [[Autumn]] Equinox that year. This followed on from some disagreements with the northern orcs about how an [[Ambassador|ambassador]] might be appointed - they made clear that a uniquely Varushkan [[Ambassador]] would be particularly appealing to them, to the point where a physical [[Embassy|embassy]] would be unnecessary. The [[Imperial Senate]] declined their offer. 
The [[Embassy|embassy]] itself stands in [[Miekarova]], just across the lake from Wendell's Hope in Mieriada. Isolated, snowed under for nearly half the year, the [[Embassy|embassy]] is already seen as a poor posting for civil servants. By the time the [[Embassy|embassy]] was completed the Varushkan Juha the Cave Spider  of the Circle of Zulgan Tash was already serving as [[Ambassador|ambassador]] for several seasons.

### [[Thule]] Merchants
The Embassy in [[Miekarova]] means that the ambassador enjoys the benefits of mercantile support from [[Traders|traders]] keen to curry their favour. As a [[Ministry]], this allows them to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] at a set price. The ambassador spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions|sanctions]] on trade with [[Otkodov]] in [[Winter]] 382YE the [[Cost|cost]] to benefit from the [[Ministry]] was increased by roughly a fifth.
### Heating Provision
During [[Spring]] 383YE, the ambassador of the time Yevgeni Katzev, liased with the civil service to arrange additional supplies for the embassy. This allows the ambassador to spend 1 crown to provide firewood to the [[Thule]] who live there. Apart from possibly improving the mood of Rak Who-Speaks-For-The-Dragons-Undivided in the colder months (which for Wendell's Hope is essentially every month except the very height of Summer), there is no tangible benefit for doing this.
