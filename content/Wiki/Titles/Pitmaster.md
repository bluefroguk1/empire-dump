## Overview
The [[Pitmaster]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to an Imperial Orc citizen. It is a national position appointed by majority vote of the Imperial Orc senators. The position is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income drawn from the fees generated by the [[Skarsind]] College of Pit Fighting.
## Responsibilities
As a [[Sinecure|sinecure]], the [[Pitmaster]] has few responsibilities. The running and maintenance of the college's facilities is left to trained pit fighters and [[Shamans|shamans]]. If the [[Skarsind]] College of Pit Fighting were threatened, it would be the responsibility of the [[Pitmaster]] to deal with that threat
## Powers
As a [[Sinecure|sinecure]], the [[Pitmaster]] has no legal powers, but they receive an income from the college's fees to the sum of 216 rings a season.
## [[Appointment]]
The title is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Imperial Orcs]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Imperial Orc citizen. The [[Pitmaster]] has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Imperial Orc [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## [[Skarsind]] College of Pit Fighting
The college is made up of a small number of sturdy buildings built near the settlement of Skogei. The largest structure by far is the arena, constructed from stone and reinforced with [[White granite]]. There are murals [[Painted|painted]] on the walls of the arena depicting a number of deceased pit fighters.
Beneath the pit of the arena is 'The Gibbet' where fighters prepare for their [[Battles|battles]], the name stuck after legionnaires from the two armies projected their gallows humour onto the building. Blood often seeps down from the pit above and occasionally spatters the fighters before a [[Fight|fight]] in the pit.
