## Overview
The Butterfly Holt is a preserve in the light woodlands of southern Srodkoja, not far from the vale of Olodny. It was commissioned in [[Spring]] 381YE by the [[Urizen]] Julianna of Phoenix Reach using one of the new Imperial Wayleaves. Its creation followed an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] resulting from a performance of [[Wondrous Forests of the Night]]. Work was completed shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice 381YE.
This [[Imperial Title]] grants custodianship of a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of [[Iridescent gloaming|Iridescent Gloaming]]. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Gloaming Sentinel]] has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[Iridescent gloaming|Iridescent Gloaming]] from the Butterfly Holt. If the Holt were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Gloaming [[Sentinel]] to deal with those threats.

__TOC__
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Appointment|appointment]], replacement or removal of the [[Gloaming Sentinel]] is made by the [[Declaration|declaration]] of [[Candidacy|candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]].
The Gloaming [[Sentinel]] serves until they are replaced by another [[Magician|magician]] using the [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]]. [[The Sentinel]] cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## Butterfly Holt
The Butterfly Holt is an area of woodland set aside not far from Olodny, several acres surrounded by a high palisade reinforced by [[Weirwood|weirwood]]. It has been populated by butterflies bred from carefully selected cocoons, many of them enriched with residual [[Night magic]] from the potent Empire-wide [[Enchantment]] after the [[Winter]] Solstice 380YE. The butterflies are notably large, and unlike most such insects their wings are especially pale. Their cocoons especially rich in valuable iridescent gloaming.
The location of this iridescent butterfly reserve has caused a few raised eyebrows; the forests of [[Varushka]] are by no means safe. They are home to the grim horrors the Varushkans call Wolves. They are hungry, instinctual horrors that seek to feast on living flesh. Ghouls and husks are common examples of Wolves. These hungry, bestial creatures sometimes form large [[Groups|groups]] and besiege a vale, or fall on travelers in large numbers. The primary task of the boyars and [[Schlacta|schlacta]] is to keep the Wolves at bay - but the [[Boyar|boyar]] of Olodny has made it pretty clear they have no interest in making any particular effort to extend their protection to the Butterfly Holt.
[[The Sentinel]] is appointed through [[The Conclave|the Conclave]]; the civil service advised that the well worn path to appointing such a [[Sinecure|sinecure]] would be through the [[Imperial Bourse]], but the circumstances surrounding the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] made it reasonable that it could be appointed by [[Declaration]] of [[Candidacy]].
