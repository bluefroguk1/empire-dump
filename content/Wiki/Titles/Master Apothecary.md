## Overview
The [[Master Apothecary]] is an [[Imperial Title]] in [[Wintermark]]. The [[Master Apothecary]]'s Garden was commissioned by a motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Winter]] 378YE. The position of Master [[Apothecary]] is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of [[Herbs|herbs]]. 
## Responsibilities
The Master Apothecary is expected to use the herbs provided by the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] to create potions of use by Imperial troops. While the title itself is national, the responsibilities could easily be interpretted to cover aiding soldiers of any Imperial nation. Further, there is a tacit suggestion that the Master Apothecary could feel empowered to organise other apothecaries to make more potions than are possible with just the herbs from the sinecure.
In addition, if [[The Garden|the garden]] were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the [[Gatekeeper]] to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Bounty of the Master Apothecary
The Master Apothecary receives an income of herbs each season: 6 doses of [[Bladeroot]], 5 doses of [[True Vervain]], 4 doses each of [[Imperial Roseweald]] and  [[Marrowort]], and 2 doses of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]]. [[Bladeroot]] and True Vervain prosper in the northern hills, but the gardeners struggle to maintain more than a few patches of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]].
==[[Appointment]]== 
The Master Apothecary is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Wintermark]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a Wintermark citizen. The Master Apothecary has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Wintermark [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Master Apothecary's Garden
Calling the sinecure the Master Apothecaries ''Garden'' is slightly ironic. Far from a neat, tended, walled cottage garden, it represents a diverse variety of small isolated groves and windblasted hilltops spread across many miles of the rolling hills of southern Kalpamark. The Master Apothecary, and the small number of gardeners who tend the various groves, need good boots and stout sticks at least as much as they need gardening tools.
