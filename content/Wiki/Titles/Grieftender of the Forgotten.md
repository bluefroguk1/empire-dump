## Overview
The [[Grieftender of the Forgotten]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by [[The Senate|the Senate]] in [[Winter]] 383YE to oversee the Field of [[Glory]] following the conquest of [[Ossium]]. The position of Grieftender is a [[Sinecure]], producing [[Marrowort]] each season. The field is in part of the Galath Fields, in [[Ossium]].
## Responsibilities
The Grieftender is responsible for overseeing the field itself and dealing with any problems arising from its haunted nature, but beyond that they receive an income of valuable [[Herbs|herbs]] from the field each season. If the Field of [[Glory]] were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Grieftender to deal with those threats. 
## Powers
### Inordinate [[Marrowort]]
The Grieftender gains custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. Each season they receive 18 drams of [[Marrowort|marrowort]], which grows copiously in the Field of [[Glory]].
## [[Appointment]]
The title is selected by unanimous decision of the Varushkan senators at the Winter Solstice. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Varushkan citizen. The Grieftender serves until the next scheduled election. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Varushkan [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Field of [[Glory]]
This ironic name is given to the site of one of the first significant engagements between the Imperial forces and the [[Druj]]. Some twenty thousand human and orc farmers and fishers who had fled the invading force were corralled by the [[Druj]], given makeshift weapons and driven to engage Imperial forces. The result was a bloodbath, with barely a handful of Imperials injured or slain and thousands of farmers or fisherfolk wounded and killed. [[The Battlefield|The battlefield]] has since been discovered to be rich in [[Marrowort]], although some reports suggest the area is now haunted by the ghosts of terrified and angry orcs and humans caught between the malice of the [[Druj]] and the zeal of the [[Imperial armies]].
### Exploiting the Field of [[Glory]]
* An expansion could be commissioned to earn income and grow additional herbs
The fertile soil of [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] could be further exploited. This would require a [[Commission|commission]], and an investment of 12 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], 12 wains of [[White granite|white granite]], 48 crowns, and take three months to complete. At the end of that time the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] would produce valuable crops [[Worth|worth]] 10 crowns, an additional 6 drams of [[Marrowort|marrowort]] each season, and 6 drams of both [[Bladeroot]] and [[True Vervain|true vervain]] each season on top of the existing crop of marrowort.
