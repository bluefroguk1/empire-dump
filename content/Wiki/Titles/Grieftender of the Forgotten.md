## Overview
The [[Grieftender of the Forgotten]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by the Senate in Winter 383YE to oversee the Field of [[Glory]] following the conquest of [[Ossium]]. The position of Grieftender is a [[Sinecure]], producing [[Marrowort]] each season. The field is in part of the Galath Fields, in Ossium.
## Responsibilities
The Grieftender is responsible for overseeing the field itself and dealing with any problems arising from its haunted nature, but beyond that they receive an income of valuable herbs from the field each season. If the Field of Glory were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Grieftender to deal with those threats. 
## Powers
### Inordinate Marrowort
The Grieftender gains custodianship of a Sinecure. Each season they receive 18 drams of marrowort, which grows copiously in the Field of Glory.
## [[Appointment]]
The title is selected by unanimous decision of the Varushkan Senators at the Winter Solstice. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by any Varushkan citizen. The Grieftender serves until the next scheduled election. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Varushkan National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## Field of Glory
This ironic name is given to the site of one of the first significant engagements between the Imperial forces and the [[Druj]]. Some twenty thousand human and orc Farmers and fishers who had fled the invading force were corralled by the Druj, given makeshift weapons and driven to engage Imperial forces. The result was a bloodbath, with barely a handful of Imperials injured or slain and thousands of farmers or fisherfolk wounded and killed. [[The Battlefield]] has since been discovered to be rich in Marrowort, although some reports suggest the area is now haunted by the ghosts of terrified and angry orcs and humans caught between the malice of the Druj and the zeal of the Imperial armies.
### Exploiting the Field of Glory
* An expansion could be Commissioned to earn income and grow additional herbs
The fertile soil of the battlefield could be further exploited. This would require a Commission, and an investment of 12 wains of [[Weirwood]], 12 wains of [[White granite]], 48 crowns, and take three months to complete. At the end of that time the sinecure would produce valuable crops [[Worth]] 10 crowns, an additional 6 drams of marrowort each season, and 6 drams of both [[Bladeroot]] and true vervain each season on top of the existing crop of marrowort.
