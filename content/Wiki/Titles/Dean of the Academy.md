## Overview
The [[Dean of the Academy]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by [[The Senate|the Senate]] in [[Spring]] 379YE. The title had significant constitutional implications, and was eventually ratified by [[Empress Lisabetta]] during the Spring Equinox 380YE.
## Responsibilities
The Dean of [[The Academy|the Academy]] is expected to use their power to raise a motion in the [[Senate]] on behalf of the [[Academy Student Council]]. It is important to realise, however, that as always the holder of an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] may do whatever they wish with the powers granted to them.   
## Powers
It is important to note that while the Dean of Students has the ability to propose a motion to the Senate they do not have the ability to vote, speak, or make announcements.
### Proposal
The Dean of Students can propose one motion to the Senate each summit. The Dean follows all the normal rules and limitations regarding [[Senate Motions|senate motions]] - including the requirement to find someone else to second that motion, the requirement that it be submitted to the civil service, and the requirement for it to pass [[Scrutiny]].
The Dean of Students can also second one motion raised by someone else each summit.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Dean of the Academy]] is an Imperial position appointed by the Senate. As a title created by a motion with constitutional implications, the [[Appointment|appointment]] requires a two-thirds majority vote of the senators of [[The Empire|the Empire]], whether or not they are present, or even in position at that time. Only Senators may vote - the [[Conscience of the Senate]] may not participate, and the appointment may be vetoed by the [[Imperial Synod]] as with any other constitutional vote. 
Any Imperial citizen can hold this title - the title is ''not'' restricted to members of [[The Academy|the Academy]] staff. The Dean serves for a year. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
