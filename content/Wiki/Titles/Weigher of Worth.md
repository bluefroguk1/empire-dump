## Overview
The ''[[Weigher of Worth]]'' is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to an Imperial Orc citizen. The [[Sinecure|sinecure]] was announced in [[Summer]] 381YE, by Azzam i Zaydan i Requeza, using an Imperial Wayleave. It brings with it custodianship of a [[Sinecure]] located in the mountains of eastern Gildermark, called the Halls of [[Worth]]. The halls provide a bounty of crystal mana.
## Responsibilities
The [[Weigher of Worth]] is expected to use the crystal mana they receive to seek out new items of [[Worth]], and to deliver them into the right hands.To aid with this they receive a bounty of crystal mana from the Halls of [[Worth]]. If the Halls themselves were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Weigher to deal with those threats  - but also to deal with any [[Opportunity]] to expand the [[Sinecure|sinecure]], or to make any decisions about its operation.
The [[Weigher of Worth]] is also charged with helping organise the [[Anvil]] [[Night of Worth]] celebration that takes place each year during the [[Spring]] Equinox.
## Powers
### [[Oathwright]]'s Bounty
As a [[Sinecure|sinecure]], the [[Weigher of Worth]] receives an income drawn from several mana sites in the caves near the Halls.
The holder of the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] receives nine crystals of mana each season.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The Weigher of [[Worth]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[Senator]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by any Imperial Orc citizen. The [[Weigher of Worth]] has [[Tenure|tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Halls of [[Worth]]
The Halls of Worth are located on a high mountain over looking Gildenheim, the capital and heart of [[Skarsind]], not far from the [[Brilliant Shore]]. The relatively inhospitable location of the Hall is seen as an advantage. Any orc who wishes to travel there and consult the oathwrights who call the Halls home must first undertake a tiring trek up into the mountains - the path is well marked but far from easy. 
The Halls are built in an area known for frigid caves, where the flows of mana are particularly strong. Several covens of Imperial Orc magicians, primarily of the oathwright tradition tend the Halls and gather mana from the caves. The majority of the mana is claimed for their own use, but a portion is set aside for the Weigher of Worth to aid them in their search for new items that can be used to inspire future generations of [[Imperial Orcs]]. The Halls extend an open invitation to any oathwright to come and visit, to discuss the arcane and spiritual philosophies of worth and the nature of bonding. In addition to regular visits from orc magicians, the Halls also see occasional visits from Varushkan [[Volhov|volhov]] with similar interests who brave the significantly more arduous climb into the peaks of [[Skarsind]] from the [[Karov]] side.
Younger orcs looking for help in building their legend, or older orcs who wish to strengthen themselves to resist the pull of the Howling Abyss are encouraged to travel to the Halls of Worth, or to consult the Weigher of Worth for guidance. The Halls maintain a small collection of items with historical import, but they are not intended as a museum, but as a place of learning and study.
