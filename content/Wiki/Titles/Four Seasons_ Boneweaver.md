## Overview
The Four Season's [[Boneweaver]] is an [[Imperial Title]] authorised by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Autumn 381YE. The Boneweaver oversees the Weavers' Market in [[Skarsind]] , built on the Ruins of the Four-Seasons Market of Estermark.
### Responsibilities
The Four Seasons Boneweaver is expected to ensure the Weavers' Market continues to serve weavers and reavers alike, providing a place for them to trade their Wares. As custodian of the [[Ministry]] they would also be the responsible for dealing with any threats to the Market, as well as resolving any [[Opportunity]] that arises.
## Powers
### Reavers' Mana
Mana Crystals
7 Crowns8 mana crystals
17 Crowns16 mana crystals
35 Crowns25 mana crystals
The Weavers' Market is a Ministry. The Boneweaver can purchase quantities of crystal mana from reavers that Visit the town of Krysse, buying at a set price. The Boneweaver makes their decision how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
## [[Appointment]]
The Four Seasons' Boneweaver is deterMined during the Winter Solstice. Custodianship of the Weaver's Market is assigned to whichever Imperial Orc candidate receives the most support from Imperial Orc owners of Military units who supported an [[Imperial army]] during the previous year. The larger the [[Military unit]] an individual has, and the more often they supported the Imperial armies, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse.
The title can be held by any Imperial Orc citizen. As a title appointed through the [[Imperial Bourse]], the Four Seasons' Boneweaver cannot be revoked.
## The Weavers' Market
Before the [[Thule]] invaded, the Four-Seasons Market at Krysse played host to merchants from across Skarsind and nearby [[Varushka]], as well as traders from as far afield as [[The Brass Coast]]. When Skarsind was returned to Imperial hands, the market looked set to become a regular fixture again - and the overSeer stood to make a pretty profit. Unfortunately, shortly after the Winter Solstice 380YE, the Four-Seasons Market was destroyed in a catastrophic fire. Rumours have since come to light that this was no accident - coinciding as it did with the fall of Dogri Thulebane. In Autumn 381YE work was begun on a new market built over the charred ruins of the old Four-Seasons.
Almost immediately after it was Commissioned, it was discovered that the Weavers' Market was intended to be called the ''Reavers market but that a spelling mistake lead to it being referred to as the ''Weavers' Market'' when it was passed by the Imperial Senate. Unfortunately Senate legal procedure is clear - the name of the market cannot be changed without a new [[Senate motion]], so the mistake would be very expensive to correct.
The initial plan came from an old reaver who recognised that while the wood and cloth of the old market was burnt beyond recovery, the stone cobbled streets and many of the walls of the old buildings were still sound and serviceable. The aspiration was that reavers would come here to sell their goods, but the hope was that [[Imperial Orcs]] and others would come here to trade mana crystals in particular. Most of the Weavers' Market is thus built around providing places to buy, sell, and store crystal mana.
While it has been successful in its original aim,  the mix-up with the name, means that the market has also attracted a number of Imperial Orcs skilled at creating and working cloth. At first the two groups - weavers and reavers - engaged in some spirited discussion but in the end they agreed to share the market after the weavers put on a stronger showing in the Fighting pit than some of the reavers had anticipated. Now, tired and weary reavers come to Krysse to sell valuable crystal mana, and then as often as not spend some of the money they make on good sturdy clothes. Orc Magicians also come to Krysse from across Skarsind, while human magicians travel up from Torfast, and both groups likewise find a ready market for good quality robes and [[Mage]] armour. Some of the weavers and tailors are happy to accept crystal mana in payment for their work - which they can then sell to the Boneweaver. Those reavers who have [[Materials]] to sell find eager customers among the artisans here, further encouraging the independent orc warriors to come to Krysse in preference for other markets.
With not one but several streams of traders coming to the Weavers' Market, Kysse is becoming a bustling settlement again. Two new inns are already under construction - one built by retired reavers and the other by newly-[[Liberated]] orcs from Jarm - and there is talk of both a new forge to cater to the warriors among the reavers and a school to train weavers not only in the creation of clothing but also mage robes, vestments, and Mage armour.
The only real concern that remains now is quite where all the mana will come from. The obvious source for such wealth would be the mana-rich lands of the Thule to the north, but it would be illegal for any reavers to raid those lands while [[The Empire]] is at peace with the Thule. There have been no complaints from the Thule to date, so either nobody has attempted it or nobody has been caught. However it could certainly prove problematic for the new Boneweaver if the fiscal pressure exerted by having such a Prosperous market into which to sell mana caused some reavers to go further afield in search of crystals.
