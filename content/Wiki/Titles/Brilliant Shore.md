## Overview
The [[Brilliant Shore]] stands near Gildenheim, in the Imperial Orc Territory of [[Skarsind]]. Custodianship of the Brilliant Shore grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[White granite]].
## The Resource
When the sun reflects on the workings on the cliff faces near Gildenheim, the reflection is blinding and it is this phenomenon that gives the white granite quarry its name. The deposits of white granite in the Brilliant Shore were discovered centuries ago by a young icewalker who took shelter in the area while the Region was assailed by a Magical storm conjured by the [[Thule]]. When the magician noticed that the storm passed over the cave where they were sheltering, they realized that something in the area must be weakening the [[Curse]]. Further investigation of the cave discovered the white granite deposits, and provided the [[Wintermark People]] with a valuable resource.
In the Early years of [[The Empire]], the Brilliant Shore was assigned as an Imperial seat, and could be held by any citizen. It was one of the first areas seized by the Thule when Skarsind fell, and reclaimed at the turning point of the recent [[War]]. At the summit of Winter 377, when the status of the seat was debated; the [[Imperial Senate]] declared it a national resource in the control of [[Wintermark]] but the [[Imperial Synod]] exercised their [[Veto]] to make the Senate reconsider. The position was confirmed as a national resource in the control of Wintermark at the Spring summit of 378.
Following the relinquishment of Skarsind, and its subsequent assignment as the new homeland of the [[Imperial Orcs]], the Brilliant Shore became an Imperial Orc national bourse seat in Summer 380YE. in Spring 382YE, however, it was the subject of the first official motion of Relinquishment since the Imperial Senate created that power the previous season. The motion passed, and later that same summit the Brilliant Shore was redefined as an Imperial position.
## The Bourse Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of white granite which is theirs to do with as they will. If the Brilliant Shore were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Brilliant Shore, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Brilliant Shore comes with a seat on the Imperial Bourse. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an Imperial title that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of White granite
The Seat has control of a source of White granite and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 26 Imperial wains of White granite every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all white granite Bourse seats, the holder of the title is deterMined during the Summer Solstice. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title.
Custodianship of the Brilliant Shore is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be revoked by the Imperial Synod.
