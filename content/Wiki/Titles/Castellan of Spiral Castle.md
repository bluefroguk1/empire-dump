## Overview
The title of [[Castellan of Spiral Castle]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] appointed by the people of [[Dawn]].
Built in pre-Imperial times, [[Spiral]] Castle stands in [[Weirwater]] at the heart of a small [[Weirwood|weirwood]] [[Forest|forest]]. Built around a strong [[Summer]] [[Regio]], the Castle is owned by the de Casillon [[Family|family]]. Many of the nobles who live there are descendants of [[Empress Richilde]]. During the height of the Sun Queen's reign, the [[Imperial Senate]] agreed to a request that the resources of [[Spiral]] Castle be dedicated to the support and upkeep of the armies of [[The Empire|the Empire]], and of [[Dawn]] in particular. The [[Earl]] of [[Spiral]] Castle has always been an [[Enchanter]], and usually possessed of a strong [[Changeling]] [[Lineage]]. 
The title of Castellan was created to allow the somewhat insular inhabitants of the castle to fulfil their duties without having to spend too much time away from their castle. When [[Imperial armies]] are not in need of emergency supplies, the nobles and yeofolk of [[Spiral]] Castle tend to their [[Weirwood|weirwood]] groves, practice their [[Magic|magic]], hawking and hunting, and commune with the eternals of the Summer [[Realm]]. Over the centuries, they have drifted further and further away from Imperial concerns, and some members of the [[Imperial Synod]] have expressed concerns over whether they are entirely human any more.
After the death of [[Emperor Hugh]] in 368YE, the inhabitants of [[Spiral]] Castle abruptly withdrew from contact with [[The Empire|the Empire]], shrouding their woodland behind a wall of swirling mist. Attempts to make contact have so far been ignored, and attempts to penetrate the mist have left explorers disoriented, emerging from the mists very close to where they entered them after hours of stumbling through hostile woodlands.
In Summer 379YE, following a [[Challenge|challenge]] by the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Barien]], the [[Heroes|heroes]] of [[Dawn]] recovered the Equine rod and convinced the nobles of Spiral Castle to bring down the walls of mist and rejoin [[The Empire|the Empire]].
In [[Spring]] 380YE, following suggestions from the House de Casillon, [[The Senate|the Senate]] agreed to expand the reach of Spiral Castle to allow for armies in nearby territories to be resupplied, without having to come to the Castle itself.
## Responsibilities
The Castellan is responsible for directing the efforts of Spiral Castle to provide emergency resupply of armies based in [[Weirwater]]. They have the final say on which army [[Will|will]] benefit from the Castle's bounty. They are also expected to represent the nobles of Spiral Castle in their dealings with the outside world - which primarily means keeping them at arm's length and discouraging visitors.
## Powers
### Resupply
Each season the inhabitants of Spiral Castle could perform emergency resupply on a single named [[Imperial army]] that spends the entire season in either [[Weirwater]], [[Karsk]], [[Karov]], [[Astolat]] or [[Semmerholm]].The army recovers 500 strength (in addition to the natural resupply the army receives). They could not benefit from any other emergency resupply while benefiting from the attentions of Spiral Castle.
The army receives this emergency resupply as long as the region of Weirmoor is in Imperial hands.
OOC Note: To use this ability the Castellan should e-mail Profound Decisions after the event detailing the army they intend to resupply.
Spiral Castle represents a source of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] that was entirely dedicated to a single purpose - resupplying armies. As a consequence, the [[Weirwood|weirwood]] provided by the woodlands around the castle has an enhanced effect. If Spiral Castle were decommissioned, the woodlands would produce no more than around sixteen wains a season at best. It is likely the de Casillon [[Family|family]] would oppose efforts to decommission Spiral Castle.
### Seat on [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]
The [[Castellan of Spiral Castle]] has a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the [[Imperial Bourse]] as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of Golden Apples
In [[Winter]] 379YE, the inhabitants of Spiral Castle declared their intention to provide the Castellan with three golden apples from their private orchards. Going forward, this valuable ''[[Vis|vis]]'' [[Will|will]] be received by the Castellan each season.
## [[Appointment]]
Before the inhabitants of Spiral Castle withdrew behind their wall of [[Enchanted|enchanted]] mists, this title was appointed during the Summer Solstice; since its recovery, it is now appointed during the [[Autumn]] Equinox. 
The [[Castellan of Spiral Castle]] is appointed by citizens of [[Dawn]] who control military units. The larger the [[Military unit|military unit]] an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the [[Bourse]]. 
Only a Dawnish character is able to hold the title. It is traditional for a yeofolk to hold the title, but there is no legal requirement that this be the case. As a title in the Bourse, the [[Castellan of Spiral Castle]] cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
