## Overview
[[Keeper of the Cox]] is an [[Imperial Title]] [[Construct summer sinecure|anounced]] by the [[Arcane Architect]] in Spring 382YE. After some legal wrangling, work on the [[Sinecure]] was completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox of the same year. Unlike many similar sinecures, the Keeper receives not a bounty of crystal mana, but an amount of [[Vis#Golen Apples|vis]] from the Summer Realm.
## Responsibilities
The Keeper has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of Golden Apples from the [[#Grove of Golden Cox|Grove of Golden Cox]] in [[Reikos]]. If the grove were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Keeper to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Golden Apples
The [[Keeper of the Cox]] gains custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. They receive an income of 3 [[Vis#Golden Apples|Golden Apples]] each season.
==Appointment== 
As with all titles created by the [[Arcane Architect]], the appointment, replacement, or removal of the Keeper is made by the [[Declaration#Declaration of Candidacy|declaration of candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. Any Imperial citizen may hold the title.
The [[Keeper of the Cox]] serves until they are replaced by another magician using the Declaration of Candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]].
## Grove of Golden Cox
This bountiful apple orchard stands in the gardens surrounding the [[Reikos#High Chalcis|Shining Towers]] of [[Reikos#High Chalcis|High Chalcis]] in [[Reikos]]. The orchard is aligned with the Summer [[Regio]] that sits at the heart of the chapterhouse, and seems to draw strength from it. Designed by the [[Arcane Architect]] Vitore Van Temeschwar, and funded by Asael of [[Highguard groups#Cantiarch.E2.80.99s Hold|Cantiarchâ€™s Hold]] and Dagon of the [[Highguard groups#The Shattered Tower|Shattered Tower]], the orchard is laid out in a heptagon, with each division growing a different cultivar of apple. 
In the heart of the orchard is a single summer tree with the most vibrant emerald-green leaves that produces valuable [[Vis#Golden Apples|Golden Apples]] in a shape and size similar to the cox. The tree is itself quite miraculous in its way; it produces blossom and apples simultaneously all year round - the flowers of one season becoming the fruit of the next even when snow lies heavy on the ground. Stories say that the tree grew to its current size in the space of only three months from a single cutting brought to the mortal realm from a chamber in the Summer Realm; others claim the tree is in fact a staff granted by [[Meraud]] to Brother Luke of the Shattered Tower that when planted firmly in the ground transformed into the grand apple tree it is today.
Beneath the shade of the tree stands a simple stone statue of a [[Highguard|Highborn]] woman, songbook in hand, singing to the sky. On the low plinth atop which she stands is The simple inscription: "''Majesty in Song. Magdalena''". Several of the [[Chapter|chapters]] of High Chalcis visit the orchards for choir practice, and it is a rare day that song does not drift through the trees.
