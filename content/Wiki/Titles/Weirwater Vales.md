## Overview
The [[Weirwater Vales]] are located in Wickmoor in the Dawnish [[Territory]] of [[Weirwater]]. Custodianship of the Vales grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Weirwood|weirwood]]
## The [[Resource]]
[[Weirwater]] is named for the forests that dot this [[Landscape|landscape]] and the rich supplies of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] they produce. The [[Weirwater Vales]] are an Imperial resource, and while there is some occasional grumbling from the earls, this is unlikely to change. The houses of Seerken and deCourney who once claimed the land on which the Vales stand each blame the other for the fact that they no longer control the [[Weirwood|weirwood]] [[Forest|forest]] - their feud has persisted for nearly four hundred years and shows no sign of abating any time soon.
Legend claims that the first weavers made a pact with an [[Eternal|eternal]] to enchant the woods, but that the [[Magic|magic]] has slowly dwindled over time. Yet there is still [[Magic|magic]] here, of a sort.
The workers of [[Weirwater]] Vale are used to it, but every so often visitors to the area make an unsettling discovery. Colloquially known as a Bone Hanger, it is a tree decorated with wild flowers, ribbons, and small knicknacks made with twine and sticks. Whenever such trees are found, workers [[Will|will]] take undue care removing all the decorations, and pack them in a box made of the first [[Weirwood|weirwood]] harvested that season. The workers then fell the [[Weirwood|weirwood]] tree, knowing that it [[Will|will]] be the best wood of the seasons harvest. The box of decorations is left in a certain place, an old ring of black stone, for the mysterious owner to collect. By the next season, the box [[Will|will]] be [[Gone|gone]], and perhaps another tree [[Will|will]] be decorated.
Visitors to the area are sometimes unaware of the traditions. Some are unlucky enough to take one of the knickknacks, possibly as a keepsake, or some sort of memento. If one of the workers discovers the accidental crime, they make every effort to return the trinket to the Bone Hanger. As long as it is returned before nightfall, there [[Will|will]] be no tragic consequences. Every so often someone will come to the Vales intending to stop the "idolatrous" reverence for the Bone Hangers. On one occasion, an ambitious priest from [[Holberg]] tried to make a name for themselves by stripping a tree of its decorations and [[Burning|burning]] them.
Disrespect for the Bone Hangers always ends in the same way. The transgressor will be found a short time later, serving as a grisly decoration on another weirwood tree. The workers will draw lots as to who will remove the body - it is gruesome, bloody work. 
The nature of the spirit that haunts the [[Weirwater Vales]] is a matter for debate. More than one scholar has pointed to the proximity of [[Karov]] and wondered if the spirit is not some creature of the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Realms|realms]] as is often theorised, but an exiled Varushkan sovereign. Regardless of its nature, there is no doubt that there is ''something'' in the woods here, and that it will not tolerate disrespect.
## [[The Bourse]] Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of weirwood which is theirs to do with as they will. If the [[Weirwater Vales]] were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity|opportunity]] were to arise related to the [[Weirwater]] Vales, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the [[Bourse]]
Custodianship of the [[Weirwater Vales]] comes with a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the [[Imperial Bourse]] as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of weirwood
The Seat has control of a source of weirwood and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 23 Imperial wains of weirwood every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all weirwood Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the [[Winter]] Solstice. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title. 
Custodianship of the [[Weirwater]] Vales is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An [[Imperial Bourse]] seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
