__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that has the right to raise a single [[Declaration]]. Although the bearer does not have to be a member of the [[Imperial Conclave]], they may raise any single [[Declaration|declaration]] provided that they do so at the summit that the title was appointed.
## Power
### Rogue Declaration
The [[Arbiter]] of the Rogue Declaration is entitled to submit a single Declaration of any kind to the agenda for the Saturday evening [[Conclave session]]. The [[Arbiter]]'s declaration must be presented by themselves, or their [[Proxy|proxy]]. To support this, the Civil Service provides a writ to the winner of the auction that allows them to submit a declaration.
Unlike other titles that have the power to raise a single declaration in [[The Conclave|the Conclave]], such as the [[Imperial Censor]], [[Imperial Magus]], or the [[Bursar of the Conclave]], the [[Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration]] is not bound to any one type of declaration. Instead they may, much like the grandmasters, choose any type of declaration to raise. Unlike the grandmasters however they, or their legal [[Proxy|proxy]], must be the one to present the declaration during the session as it is a legal power of the title.
## [[Appointment]]
The Arbiter of the Rogue Declaration is determined by auction at the [[Auction of the Seats]] and is solely in crystal mana. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title. The crystal mana from the winning bid is then added to the [[Font]] for the next summit.
The bearer retains the title ''for a single season only'' - they must use the power to raise a declaration at the summit where they gain the title, otherwise it is lost. As a title in the [[Conclave]], the position cannot be 
revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
