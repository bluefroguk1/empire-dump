## Overview
The [[Imperial Necromancer]] is an [[Imperial Title]] appointed by the Conclave. It was created during the Spring Equinox 383YE, following the Conclave's call to action during the Winter Solstice 382YE.
==Responsibilities== 
The Imperial Necromancer is expected to liaise with covens who wish to perform the Winter ritual [[Whispers through the Black Gate]], and ensure good order in the usage of that ritual for the latter half of the hour in which that ritual can be performed each day.
During the Summer Solstice 383YE, the [[Imperial Conclave]] passed a [[Declaration]] of [[Concord]] in which it stated that those who summon or animate the dead, through Whispers through the Black Gate or otherwise, must take responsibility for the outcomes which result. Furthermore, they expressed the opinion that the Imperial Necromancer should be the authority responsible for ensuring prudent and acceptable uses of [[Magic]] in dealing with the dead. While this responsibility has not been upheld by the Senate, the Conclave's declaration lays out a clear expectation that the Imperial Necromancer look into and reveal abuses of this nature. In response, the Black Tablet [[Chapter]] of [[Highguard]] has pledged to make certain useful tools available to the Imperial Necromancer as long as they remain committed to overseeing - and safeguarding [[The Empire]] against - necromantic magic.
## Powers
### Keeper of the Black Gate
The Imperial Necromancer has control of the Imperial [[Regio]] for the second half of the hour when it is possible to cast Whispers through the Black Gate, on each day of each summit. The Imperial Necromancer may choose which covens may use the regio in this time, and the order in which they may use it.
(OOC Note: It should be noted that this is a ''legal'' power only; the title gains no innate power to prevent someone from casting a ritual. If someone were to choose to ignore the Imperial Necromancer and perform a ritual without permission the game rules would not stop them, but the coven would face in-character legal repercussions for subverting the agencies of state.)

A [[Necropolis]] chapter called the ''Black Tablet'', primarily made up of SteWards of the dead, have pledged to make certain opportunities available to the Imperial Necromancer in response to the Conclave's agreement that covens should be held responsible for spirits raised, and that the Imperial Necromancer should ensure that those who abuse the power of necromancy for frivolous reasons, unleash uncontrolled spirits in an unwise fashion, or who intentionally create ghosts or bind the spirits of humans or orcs, are brought to the attention of the Conclave and charged with [[Sorcery]].
For as long as the Imperial Necromancer remains committed to preserving the separation between the living and the spirits of the dead, the Highborn chapter will help them to acquire tools and supplies that will assist them to perform their tasks, in a manner similar to a [[Ministry]]. As with a ministry, this allows them to purchase quantities of special [[Materials]] at a set price. The Imperial Necromancer spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
## [[Appointment]]
The appointment, replacement, or removal of the Imperial Necromancer is made by the declaration of [[Candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. Any Imperial citizen may hold the title. The Necromancer serves until they are replaced by another magician using the declaration of candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, they cannot be revoked.
