This title lost its bounty of mana when the [[Druj]] destroyed the Tower of the Fall. 
## Overview
The [[Keeper of the Tower of the Fall]] was an [[Urizen]] [[Imperial Title]] created following an announcement in [[Autumn]] 378YE by the [[Crystal Architect of the Spires]]. The position of Custodian was a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana.
During the [[Spring]] Equinox 380YE, a plague of crystal-eating [[Vermin|vermin]] saw [[The Senate|the Senate]] [[Commission|commission]] [[White granite|white granite]] wards to help protect the Tower, which had the unexpected outcome of adding additional production to the [[Sinecure|sinecure]].
During the 381YE [[Druj]] invasion of [[Zenith]], the Tower of the Fall was destroyed by orc invaders.
## Responsibilities
The Custodian was technically responsible for maintaining the Tower of the Fall; in practice though the [[Day|day]]-to-day running and repair of the waterfall and pool lay in the hands of the civil service. The Keeper simply received a bounty of crystal mana from the Tower of the Fall in [[Zenith]]. 
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Keeper gained custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. They received an income of 10 crystal mana each season.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The [[Keeper of the Tower of the Fall]] was appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] senators. 
The title could be held by an [[Urizen]] citizen. The Keeper had [[Tenure|tenure]], and served until they died or stepped down. They could be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Urizen]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
After the flood
Currently the Tower of the Fall is in ruins, and so the holder of this title has no powers and receives no production from the [[Sinecure|sinecure]]. If the Tower were rebuilt, (assuming the [[Druj]] are driven out of [[Zenith]]), the current holder would resume their post if they have not stepped down or died in the interim.
## The Tower of the Fall
Set high on the slopes of a snow-capped mountain, this lonely tower stood on the cliff-edge of a cliff next to one of the tallest waterfalls in [[Urizen]]. It was almost certainly built as a place for meditative Illuminates to ponder the relationship between the body, the spirit, and magical talent - but that was before the discovery of the magical bounty of the pools below. The icy waterfall cascades down [[The Mountain|the mountain]] into a plunge pool far below, creating a churning vortex of swirling water. Incongruously, at the centre of the vortex it was just possible to make out crystal formations - the kind of formation associated with the natural formation of crystal mana. 
There had been several attempts in the past to harvest these crystals, but each had met with failure. The exposed crystal formation was dangerously close to a fast moving wall of freezing water that strikes anyone nearby with the force of a dozen charging oxen. More than one tragic tale tells of would-be mana harvesters swept away and battered to death on the rocks below the plunge pool while trying to collect the crystals. The stories have grown with the telling, and the Pool of the Fall is often used as a metaphor for how [[Courage]] in the pursuit of [[Prosperity]] is sometimes not enough, and dangerous if not tempered with a little [[Wisdom]]. The nature of the pool was also seen as having a strong resonance with [[Summer magic]]; at least once the [[Eternal|eternal]] [[Barien]] has challenged an Urizen petitioner to recover crystals from the depths of the lake.
Over the years several plans had been suggested as to a safe and effective solution to collecting crystals, but it was only relatively recently that a practical solution was found. Realising that a solution that involved stopping the water flow would simply lead to flooding the crystal formation and probably damaging them in the process (assuming that the falling water was not integral to their formation in the first place), an innovative solution was proposed - a series of vanes and baffles down the length of the fall that rather that stopping the water flow, serve primarily to accelerate the vortex - both increasing its rate of magical convergence, and creating enough space at the middle to allow safer access to the crystals. 
A [[Mithril|mithril]] structure raised across the pool and delving  into the centre proved to be sufficient to allow harvesting when most normal [[Materials|materials]] have been insufficient to survive being occasionally caught by the vortex. The workers at the Tower of the Fall ensured that the tower was maintained (and available as a residence for the Keeper should they wish to visit the site), as well as being charged with adjusting the vanes and baffles to maintain the flow rate and vortex velocity through the year. The actual task of harvesting crystals was still dangerous, but not as lethally so as it was when brave (or foolhardy) people attempted to simply swim through the churning water to claim their prize.
When the [[Druj]] came, they stole the mana and then burnt the tower, sending its ruins tumbling down the cliff into the pools below, shattering the crystal formation. They tore the [[Mithril|mithril]] structure apart, leaving only twisted wreckage around the broken [[Mana site|mana site]].
