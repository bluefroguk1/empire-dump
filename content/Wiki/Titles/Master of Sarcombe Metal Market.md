## The Sarcombe Metal Exchange
The grey stone building stands proudly in the centre of Sarcombe. It is entered through a grand double door made of polished hardwood brought [[All the way|all the way]] from Alderly, with [[Mithril|mithril]] filigree depicting miners resting under an apple tree. Above [[The Door|the door]] a [[Mithril|mithril]] plaque reads "Sarcombe Metal Market" and underneath "Courtesy of Applewood". 
Much of the building is given over to a large hall that hosts the Sarcombe metal market itself. Underneath the market is a large vault, dug into the stone and made of the finest [[Mithril|mithril]] to allow safe storage of the [[Materials|materials]]. Whilst normally hidden from public view, the great vault door depicts the Applewood livery etched lightly into the surface.
Miners from all over the Mourn come here to have their ore evaluated, stored, and sold; visitors from Matilda Stone Quarries and Jonah's Lament are particularly regular visitors. [[Traders]] from as far afield as Kalpaheim and [[Tassato]] make the journey here to purchase fine [[Mournwold]] metal.
