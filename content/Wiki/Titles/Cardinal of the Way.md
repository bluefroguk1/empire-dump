## Overview
Each of the eight virtue assemblies appoints a [[Cardinal]] to represent and lead them. The [[Cardinal of the Way|Cardinal of The Way]] represents [[Assembly]] of [[The Way]], and is part of what is arguably the post powerful of the Assemblies, the [[Assembly of the Nine]]. While they are still able to raise only a single [[Judgement]] for consideration by their peers in the [[Imperial Synod]] each season, they possess a number of specific legal powers that allow them to [[Guide|guide]] and influence the Assemblies. 
The recent Severin encyclical prompted a great deal of discussion around the role of the cardinals in the [[Imperial Synod]]. 
## Responsibilities
The [[Cardinal of the Way]] is assumed to provide leadership to the priests and pilgrims who do not prioritise any one particular virtue. They are expected to be well versed in matters of [[The Way]] in [[General|general]], so that they can speak with authority on matters related to the wider practice of the faith, and of doctrine. Prominent citizens who are guilty of breaking [[The Law|the law]] but believe their actions were rooted in understanding of [[The Way|the Way]] may sometimes approach the [[Cardinal]] to plead [[Clemency]] on their behalf, so a familiarity with the [[Law|law]] may also prove helpful.
As a member of the [[Assembly]] of the Nine, the [[Cardinal of the Way]] can wield considerable influence over the politics of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. In particular the [[Assembly]] has the power to [[Veto]] any constitutional motion passed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. This allows the [[Assembly]] to uphold their constitutional obligation to "ensure the virtuous behaviour of [[The Empire|the Empire]]".
## Powers
### [[Cardinal]] of [[The Way|the Way]]
The [[Cardinal of the Way]] has the powers common to all cardinals: membership of the [[Assembly]] of the Nine; the ability to call for further [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] on a [[Judgement]] raised in any assembly by a [[Member of the Synod]] (rather than by the Tribunes); appoint the [[Conscience of the Senate]] and any other titles designated as virtuous appointments selected by the [[Cardinal]] of the Assembly of [[The Way|the Way]].
### Virtue Appointments
A virtue title might be designed in such a way that it is appointed by the [[Cardinal]] alone. Currently they have the power to appoint the [[Conscience of the Senate]], a powerful political position that represents the faithful of [[The Empire|the Empire]] in the [[Imperial Senate]], and the [[Imperial Chaplain Consular]], responsible for the Virtue of the Ambassadors selected by [[The Senate|the Senate]].
### Additional Powers
The [[Cardinal of the Way]] may possess additional powers, not shared with their fellow cardinals, either through the action of the Imperial [[Senate]] or through [[Opportunities|opportunities]] presented to them. Occasionally, a particularly virtuous Imperial citizen may look specifically to the cardinal for inspiration. Using such powers generally requires them to raise a [[Judgement]] in the Assembly of the Nine.
## [[Appointment]]
The Cardinal of the Way is appointed during the [[Winter]] Solstice by the Assembly of the Way, and must be a member of that assembly. Selection is by a [[Judgement|judgement]] of [[Appointment]] raised by the Tribune in the standard manner.
The elections for the cardinals are considered to be legally equivalent positions restricted by virtue. This means that if you change your [[Virtue assembly|virtue assembly]] then you must abstain from voting in a election if it occurs less than four [[Events|events]] after the previous election in your previous virtue assembly. If you are in any doubt about your eligibility then you should consult the Tribune, or [[Merlot]] the civil service overseer of elections who can advise you.
The [[Judgement|judgement]] to appoint a cardinal [[Will|will]] typically close at 6pm on the Saturday of the summit. These times may differ if an unscheduled [[Appointment|appointment]] is required but there are always at least three hours for nominations and three hours for voting. After that time, the candidate with the most support is declared cardinal.
The Cardinal of the Way serves until the next scheduled election for the title. They can be revoked by the [[General Assembly]], or by the virtue assembly of the Way.
