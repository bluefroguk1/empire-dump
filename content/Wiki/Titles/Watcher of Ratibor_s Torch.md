## Ratibor's Gate
The entrance to the old prison now bears a red plaque that reads “commissioned, built, and paid for by the Crimson Reaper Cartel, the Sea Wolf Mercenary Company, and Estella “the Wanderer” Krazentia Callabrese von Temeschwar in 384YE, we invite all who have Ambition to seek inspiration from Boyar Ratibor’s example here”. The plaque bears the symbols of the Cartas and individuals that contributed: the stylised wolf head of the Sea Wolves; the Skulls of the Crimson Reapers; and the constellation of the Wanderer. 
The two towers that flank the prison’s barbican are embossed with great white granite torches that are brightly lit at night with red glow-stones. [[Technology#Lightstones|Lightstones]] imported from the mountains of Karov cause the lights to flicker like heatless flames, causing the stones to seemingly flicker and cast stark shadows that dance across the prisons’ walls.
The old prison courtyard, commonly referred to as the "''Court of Enduring Flame''" since the [[385YE Spring Equinox Synod judgements#Judgement 37|Spring Eqinox 385YE]], has been covered with a vaulted roof to create a sheltered nave. On the old courtyard walls there are murals of key moments in the history of Temeschwar and Ratibor’s life in which he experienced the perfidy of the Vyig. At the centre of the nave is a great red brazier, tended by those who visit the tomb, and visitors are encouraged to stand before it and loudly declare their ambitions to those assembled. Behind the brazier is a great mural of Ratibor surrounded by the frostbitten bodies of the Vyig that died during the night of a thousand torches. 
Many of the old prison cells, once civil servant’s offices, have been converted back to facsimiles of cells that contain facts about life in the old prison. For a small fee, visitors can spend a little time in a cell to meditate on their ambitions and bask in the aura of the tomb.
