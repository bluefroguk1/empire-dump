## Overview
Each of the seven Cardinals of Virtue appoints a single [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]]. The gatekeepers have no formal [[Assembly]] - but there is often an unofficial council of gatekeepers where they meet to discuss matters of faith and decide on the allocation of [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s bounty of True [[Liao]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Gatekeeper of Loyalty]], along with the other six gatekeepers, are responsible for determining who receives the precious, and limited supply of [[True liao|true liao]]. They are expected to choose someone of obvious virtue to receive each dose. Normally, a dose of true [[Liao|liao]] is used to experience a [[Past life vision|past life vision]], but there are several other uses to which it can be put. Regardless of the wishes of the gatekeepers, [[The Law|the law]] is crystal clear. The gift of true [[Liao|liao]] is a reward from [[The Synod|the Synod]] for virtuous behaviour, and the recipient is free to put it to any legal use they wish.
In practice, each [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]] tends to take their own approach to the title. Some act as an unofficial [[Proxy|proxy]] to the [[Cardinal|cardinal]] who appointed them, working in their interests to support the faith. But sometimes they take the opposite approach. When a [[Virtue assembly|virtue assembly]] is split politically or over doctrine, the [[Cardinal|cardinal]] may agree to appoint someone with opposing views as [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]]. Some restrict their role to seeking out suitable candidates for true [[Liao|liao]] - but during the time of [[Emperor Ahraz]] for example, the gatekeepers operated as an unofficial body overseeing [[Inquisition]] and [[Condemnation]], organizing other priests to root out perceived corruption in [[The Senate|the Senate]] and [[Military Council]].
## Powers
### Keepers of True [[Liao]]
The gatekeepers are responsible for determining how true liao [[Will|will]] be distributed. The legal requirement for a decision is for a majority of the gatekeepers (four) to inform the civil service of the single decision on who [[Will|will]] receive each of the available doses of true liao. By custom, the gatekeepers often seek a unanimous decision but this is not required -  the names of four gatekeepers appended to a written document detailing who [[Will|will]] receive each dose is sufficient. Once the decision is made, it cannot be changed; a ruling instituted during the reign of [[Empress Brannan]] following several high-profile murders.
By longstanding tradition, the gatekeepers meet as a group to discuss candidates, but there is no formal meeting organised by the Civil Service. Though they are rare, there have been periods of [[Imperial history]] when the gatekeepers have been unable to agree a single candidate.  
Usually, the gatekeepers [[Will|will]] meet informally to agree their choices, acting as a defacto body similar to the [[Senate]] or [[The Conclave|the Conclave]]. This reflects the intent of the laws passed at the time and scholars have noted the similarity with a [[Greater majority|greater majority]] in the [[Synod]]. But no council has ever been formally established by [[Senate motion]], and attempts to pass [[Senate Motions|Senate motions]] that share a power between other title holders, outside of one of the five great houses of [[The Empire|the Empire]], have always been ruled unconstitutional. Many modern constitutional scholars question whether the titles would pass [[Scrutiny]] today. The complex constitutional challenges posed by the existence of the gatekeepers has thwarted all attempts to put the allocation of liao on a more secure legal basis.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Gatekeeper]] of [[Loyalty]] is appointed by the [[Cardinal of Loyalty]]. The [[Gatekeeper]] must be a member of the [[Loyalty]] [[Assembly]]. Unlike many titles, if a new [[Cardinal|cardinal]] is appointed they may immediately reappoint the appropriate gatekeeper.
The Gatekeeper serves until they die, step down, or a new [[Cardinal]] is elected and chooses a new appointee. It is important to note that once appointed the [[Cardinal]] cannot choose to simply remove their appointed gatekeeper from office. Only a successful re-election or [[Revocation|revocation]] allows a Cardinal to appoint a new Gatekeeper.
The [[Gatekeeper of Loyalty]] can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], and by the [[Loyalty]] [[Assembly]].
