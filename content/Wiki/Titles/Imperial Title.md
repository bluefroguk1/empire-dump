## Overview
An [[Imperial Title]] grants the bearer wealth or legal powers. Most come with a set of responsibilities that the recipient is expected to undertake. The most famous Imperial title is [[The Throne]] but [[Senator]], [[Cardinal]], [[General]], [[Archmage]] and the Bourse seats are all examples of powerful Imperial titles. 
## Eligibility
Any Imperial citizen is eligible to be appointed to an Imperial title, but the constitution explicitly forbids any citizen from holding two Imperial titles simultaneously. No citizen may hold two Imperial titles at the same time. Any title may be surrendered at any time, so a citizen who is elevated to a second Imperial title must immediately select which office they wish to hold.
## National Position
Some Imperial titles are only eligible to members of a specific nation. For example, only a League character can become a League senator or hold a League position in the Bourse. These titles are commonly referred to as national positions, or sometimes national titles. They are governed by all the same rules as a normal Imperial title - you cannot hold more than one Imperial Title at once - but they can only be conferred on a member of the appropriate nation.
## Responsibilities
Most titles come with a responsibility or duty that the holder is expected to perform. For instance a citizen granted the title of "Defender of the Senate" might be charged with ensuring the defence and security of the Senate during the meetings at [[Anvil]].
There is no contractual obligation to uphold the responsibilities of an office - it is not possible to create a title that requires specific action or dictates how the responsibilities must be discharged. However the responsibilities of an office are important - it is not unknown for citizens to face the threat of [[Revocation]] by the Synod for failing to adequately discharge the responsibilities of the title they have accepted.
## Powers
All Imperial titles may be granted one or more powers of state. Powers of state are legal powers exercised by one or more of the five house of government. For example, the General [[Assembly]] of the Synod is able to [[Veto]] a [[Senate motion]], but The Throne can also wield this power without needing to consult the Synod.
## Term of office
Lesser Imperial titles often have Tenure. Once elected, the holder of such a title remains in place until they die, resign the position or are revoked by the Synod. More powerful titles are usually subject to re-selection on an annual basis.
All Imperial titles have clEarly defined rules that state how the occupant can be removed.
## Photos
If your character is the holder of an Imperial Title then you are welcome to email [mailto:wiki@profounddecisions.co.uk wiki@profounddecisions.co.uk] with a photograph for the title page if you wish. In that case send the photo (including who to credit), your PID, and the title your character holds and we will add it to the relevant page on the wiki. This is entirely voluntary - there's no need to send a photo if you prefer not to.
