__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Spiral Envoy]] was an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[Urizen]] originally created by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the [[Summer]] Solstice 384YE following a request made by Kaliact, the Salt Lord of [[Spiral]]. The position was amended during the [[Autumn]] Equinox 384YE to change the method of [[Appointment|appointment]] to [[Tally of the Votes]].
The position was rendered inactive following the actions of ''[[Merchant Prince]] Kaliact''.
## Responsibilities
The [[Spiral Envoy]] was responsible for ensuring good trade relations with the [[Grendel]] in [[Spiral]] and where needed, liaising with their opposite number in Apulian. Though the Envoy had no authority to deal with the [[Grendel]] they were still expected to maintain the links with the merchants of Spiral, helping problems and [[Opportunities|opportunities]].

## Powers
### [[Ministry]]
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Spiral Envoy allowed the holder to purchase quantities of special [[Materials|materials]] at a set price. The Envoy made their decision on how much to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Resources were removed from, and resources were placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] was processed.
Unlike a standard ministry, the Spiral Envoy dealt with two different [[Groups|groups]] of [[Traders|traders]]; the Grendel interested in securing deals for the mana and metals of [[Urizen]], and a representative of Salt Lord Kaliact who offered Mithril for [[White granite]].  As such, the Envoy had not one but ''two'' streams from which they could purchase material. The Envoy could spend differing amounts on each stream - for example, they could spend 20 crowns on random ingots and tempest jade from Grendel [[Traders|traders]], and trade 4 wains of [[White granite|white granite]] for 4 wains of mithril from Spiral imports.
## [[Appointment]]
This title was appointed during the Autumn Equinox. The Spiral Envoy was appointed by citizens of Urizen who control the [[Mana site]] personal resources. The larger the [[Mana site|mana site]] an individual had the more votes they could allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only an Urizen citizen could hold the title. They did not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As a title appointed through the Bourse they could not be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
