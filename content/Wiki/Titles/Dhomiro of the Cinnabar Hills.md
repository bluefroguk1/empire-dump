## Overview
The [[Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills]] is an [[Imperial Title]]  awarded to a [[Freeborn]] citizen. It is a national position appointed through [[The Bourse|the Bourse]].
The [[Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills]] serves as an arbitrator and [[Mediator|mediator]] charged with keeping peace between the often volatile families of [[Kahraman]]. In the process, the [[Dhomiro]] encounters plenty of [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to trade for [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] from the mines of Damata, [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] from the quarries of the Jade Range, and beggar's lye gathered from the beggarwood forests above Gambit.
Some Dhomiro take their title very seriously, and spend their spare months actively travelling through [[Kahraman]] looking for opportunities to improve the lot of the Freeborn who live there. Others leave the job to agents - reaping the rewards of their position by [[Proxy|proxy]].
Prior to the popular change prompted by [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] National [[Assembly]], only those captains of fleets that had engaged in privateering during the previous year could vote for the [[Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills]]. This changed shortly before the [[Spring]] Equinox 383YE and now every captain of a [[Fleet]] in [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] has a say in who [[Will|will]] hold the title.
In 385YE around the time of the [[Appraisal]] into [[Kahraman]], the [[Territory|territory]] faced significant problems with raiders during which the Dhomiro lost access to the top two ranks of their [[Ministry|ministry]]. This problem was alleviated in [[Summer]] 385YE when [[The Senate|the Senate]] opted to fund caravan guards to secure the territory.
## Responsibilities
There is a tacit expectation that the [[Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills]] [[Will|will]] help ensure the economic stability of [[Kahraman]] - and where possible help increase the [[Prosperity]] of the [[Mine]] owners and artisans that make the hills their home. In practice, they are rarely called on to intervene directly but it is not unknown for inhabitants of [[Kahraman]] having purely economic problems to bring them to the Dhomiro before they bother a [[Senator|senator]] with them - even where the title holder is not themselves a Kahraman native it is assumed they have sufficient self-interest to remain concerned about the [[General|general]] economic welfare of the hill dwellers.
On occasion, the Dhomiro may be asked to help out with problems concerning the [[Great Mine of Briante]] or the [[Damatian Cliffs]], especially where those problems have arisen from conflict between the Freeborn and the individual who holds the [[Imperial Bourse]] seat. Some politically astute [[Dhomiro of the Cinnabar Hills]] have invested the wealth they accrue from their title towards placing trusted [[Family|family]] members in control of those valuable seats on the [[Imperial Bourse]].
