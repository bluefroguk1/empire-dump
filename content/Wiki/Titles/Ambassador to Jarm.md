## Overview
The [[Ambassador to Jarm]] is an [[Imperial Title]]. It is an Imperial position appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. The title was created as a consequence of the [[Embassy]] commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Winter]] 377YE. While work was completed after the [[Summer]] Solstice 378YE, wrangling continued for several months. The Jarmish House of Princes demanded that [[The Empire|the Empire]] select one of the three primary ports - northern Kavor, southern Vezak, or upstart eastern Rigia as the location for an Imperial [[Embassy|embassy]] - an obvious move to [[Entangle|entangle]] [[The Empire|the Empire]] in the internicine internal wranglings of the Jarmish government. The decision was made to choose Rigia, and formal relations between the two world powers opened shortly afterwards.
