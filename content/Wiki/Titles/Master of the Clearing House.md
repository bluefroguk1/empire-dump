In Autumn 383YE, the Senate chose to [[Expand the Kruidenkenner Magazjin]] in [[Necropolis]]. As a consequence, grateful merchant-herbalists of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] have made their merchandise available to the Master of the Clearing House at what they consider ''reasonable prices''. This additional track will remain available as long as [[The Empire]]'s good relations with the ''Kruidenkenner'' and the Delves continue.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The Master of the Clearing House is appointed each year during the Summer Solstice by unanimous decision of the Senators of [[The League]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a citizen of the League. The Master of the Clearing House is appointed annually. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the League National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine. 
## Tassato Apothecary Clearing House
The Apothecary Clearing House was Commissioned by Cesare Sanguineo Rezia Di Tassato of the Gilded Horn Carta during the Summer Solstice 379YE, but construction was delayed for some time. It was finally completed nEarly a year later, and opened its doors shortly before the Summer Solstice 380YE. 
The building itself is fairly unassuming - a large warehouse and offices in southern Mestra with access to private river docks. Herbs are stored in the secure warehouse until they are sold, carefUlly protected by well-paid guards. Tassato is not particularly known for its Herb gardens, but the Cesare seal-of-approval has attracted interest from herb dealers across the Empire. Now, citizens of Tassato can purchase fine quality cerulean mazzarine from [[The Brass Coast]], prepared bladeroot from [[Wintermark]] and [[Varushka]], and the best true vervain and imperial roseweald [[The Marches]] and [[Dawn]] have to offer - as well as employing the expertise of professional apothecaries. The Clearing House is open to everyone, of course - and its central position along the western borders of the Empire means it has already seen a fair amount of business between the mazzarine-starved physicks of the north and the bladeroot hungry [[Potion]]-makers of the southern coast.
