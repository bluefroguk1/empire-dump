## Overview
The [[Master of the Clearing House]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a [[The League|League]] citizen. 
## Responsibilities
The Master is responsible for ensuring that all business taking place at the Tassato Apothecary Clearing House is being undertaken in a scrupulous fashion. The fine quality of herbs passing through the doors of the Clearing House must be guaranteed, and all transactions must be conducted in a civil, legal, and timely fashion. The actual day-to-day running of the Clearing House is handled by a team of well-paid apothecary agents, and for the most part they can get on with their jobs without any interference from the Master. 
In the event that the business of the Clearing House were threatened, it would fall to the Master to deal with those threats. At the same time, they might be called on to make decisions about [[Opportunity|opportunities]] relating to the Clearing House. 
In return, the agents of the Clearing House keep provide the Master with access to any special bargains they might spot.

The Tassato Apothecary Clearing House is a [[Ministry]]. The Master can purchase quantities of [[Herb|herbs]] at a set price. The Master makes their decision how much money to spend during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
### The ''Kruidenkenner''
Herbs
7 Crowns16 random herbs
17 Crowns33 random herbs
35 Crowns50 random herbs
In Autumn 383YE, the Senate chose to [[Expand the Kruidenkenner Magazjin|expand]] the [[Kruidenkenner Trademaster#The Kruidenkenner Magazijn|Kruidenkenner Magazjin]] in [[Necropolis]]. As a consequence, grateful merchant-herbalists of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] have made their merchandise available to the [[Master of the Clearing House]] at what they consider ''reasonable prices''. This additional track will remain available as long as the Empire's good relations with the ''Kruidenkenner'' and the Delves continue.
==Appointment== 
The [[Master of the Clearing House]] is appointed each year during the Summer Solstice by unanimous decision of the [[Senator|senators]] of [[The League]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a citizen of the League. The Master of the Clearing House is appointed annually. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the League [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]]. 
## Tassato Apothecary Clearing House
The Apothecary Clearing House was [[Commission|commissioned]] by Cesare Sanguineo Rezia Di Tassato of the Gilded Horn Carta during the Summer Solstice 379YE, but [[Construct the Tassato Mana Exchange|construction]] was delayed for some time. It was finally completed nearly a year later, and opened its doors shortly before the Summer Solstice 380YE. 
The building itself is fairly unassuming - a large warehouse and offices in southern [[Tassato#Tassato Mestra|Mestra]] with access to private river docks. Herbs are stored in the secure warehouse until they are sold, carefully protected by well-paid guards. Tassato is not particularly known for its [[Herb garden|herb gardens]], but the Cesare seal-of-approval has attracted interest from herb dealers across the Empire. Now, citizens of Tassato can purchase fine quality cerulean mazzarine from [[The Brass Coast]], prepared bladeroot from [[Wintermark]] and [[Varushka]], and the best true vervain and imperial roseweald [[The Marches]] and [[Dawn]] have to offer - as well as employing the expertise of professional [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|apothecaries]]. The Clearing House is open to everyone, of course - and its central position along the western borders of the Empire means it has already seen a fair amount of business between the mazzarine-starved physicks of the north and the bladeroot hungry potion-makers of the southern coast.
