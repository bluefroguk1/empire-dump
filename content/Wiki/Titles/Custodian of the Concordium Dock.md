## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Concordium Dock]] is an [[Imperial Title]] that involves oversight of a [[Ministry]] allowing the purchase of [[White granite]] from the [[Sarcophan Delves]]. The title is also known as ''Die Bewaarder van het Vandersaar dok'' (which translates roughly as ''the Custodian of the Vandersaar Dock'' in Imperial)
Constructed by order of the [[Imperial Senate]], work was completed on this set of dedicated docks shortly before the Autumn Equinox 381YE.
## Responsibilities
The Custodian is expected to ensure that Bedelaar Huisbaas Vandersaar of the Delves continues to trade white granite to [[The Empire]]. If the Concordium Dock were ever directly threatened, they would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any Opportunity related to the dock. The continued operation of the dock, and thus the ministry, requires that relations between the Empire and the Sarcophan Delves remain cordial - ''die Bewaarder'' has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.
## Powers
### Ministry
White Granite
256 Crowns8 wains of white granite
488 Crowns16 wains of white granite
696 Crowns24 wains of White granite
As a Ministry, the title of Custodian of the Concordium Dock allows the holder to purchase quantities of White granite at a set price. They spend their money and make their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
## [[Appointment]]
As with White granite seats, the holder of the title is deterMined during the Summer Solstice. The title is auctioned by the civil servants associated with the Bourse. 
The title may be held by any Imperial citizen. As an [[Imperial Bourse]] title, the Custodian cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]]. 
Regarding Bedelaar Huisbaas Vandersaar
This title represents an agreement with the Vandersaar [[Family]] of the Sarcophan Delves. In the event the relationship between the Empire and the Delves were to deteriorate, or the Vandersar were to determine that trade with the Empire was no longer politically or economically viable, the amount of white granite available might drop - potentially to zero in a worst case scenario.
## The Concordium Dock
Also known as the ''Vandersaar Dok'' by the Sarcophan who use it, this private dock is built in Cargo, not far from the Sarcophan [[Embassy]]. It takes the form of a long pier in the Freeborn style, perhaps more suited to Siroc than Cargo, along with a pair of dedicated heavily-reinforced [[Weirwood]] cranes for lifting the white granite up to the town proper. The pier is  much more ostentatious than the nearby [[Pallas]] Docks, and includes an ornate arched structure at one end intended for use as offices by the Custodian which goes largely unused by the Sarcophan. 
The cranes lift the cargo of white granite up to the area dubbed "Little Delving" by a Marcher wag - that part of Cargo that has increasingly been taken over by Sarcophan merchants and Visitors. Two squat Warehouses store the white granite until it is purchased, guarded around the clock by well-paid Imperial mercenaries. Connecting the two warehouses is a rambling townhouse-cum-tower intended for the exclusive use of the Vandersar traders and their companions - along with a modest room and an office intended for use by ''the Custodian'' should they wish to use them, rather than the arched offices at the bottom of the cliff. 
The buildings provide an interesting example of a Sarcophan Architectural style that sees the original structure heavily modified with additional rooms, sprawling window-box gardens, and covered walkways that, while serviceable, appear ramshackle, disorganised, and thrown-together to the discerning eye of the [[Urizen]].
The dock is for the exclusive use of merchants and traders dispatched by the Bedelaar Huisbaas of the Vandersaar family, who bring regular shipments of valuable white granite from the mercantile nation. The merchant vessels invariably arrive with a solid escort of powerful Sarcophan warships - although there are rumours that the Vandersaar have made a private deal with the [[Grendel]] to ensure their trading vessels remain unmolested in the [[Bay of Catazar]]. The Vandersaar have also expressed an interest in employing vessels from [[The Brass Coast]] and [[The League]] to serve as additional protection for their priceless cargo.
(OOC Note: Any character with a [[Military unit]] who takes the paid work action in downtime is free to roleplay that they have been guarding the Vandersaar warehouses, or serving as bodyguards to Vandersaar merchants wanting to visit other parts of the Empire. The Sarcophan family pays well and promptly, and appreciates professional soldiers who can present a menacing air. Likewise, any Freeborn or League [[Fleet]] captain is free to roleplay that their privateering action involved guiding Vandersaar vessels to Cargo - or to other ports on the Bay of Catazar that welcome Sarcophan traders.)
