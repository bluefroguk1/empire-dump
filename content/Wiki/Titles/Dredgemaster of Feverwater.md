__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Dredgemaster of Feverwater]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Summer]] 377YE. At the [[Spring]] Equinox 379YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to amend the powers of the Dredgemaster. In addition to expanding the operation at Feverwater, this amendment allowed the Dredgemaster to [[Commission|commission]] [[Historical research|historical research]]. As a consequence, the civil service requested clarification from [[The Senate|the Senate]] - as this was no longer a standard [[Sinecure]], it would not automatically be a lifetime [[Appointment|appointment]]. During the [[Winter]] Solstice 381YE, the [[Senate]] voted to remove the ability to perform [[Historical research|historical research]].
During the Spring Equinox 384YE, the [[Advisor on the Vallorn]], Nathair Autumngale, commissioned some Historical research into the docks which cast new light on some of the mysteries here. During the Summer Solstice of that year, the [[Cardinal of Prosperity]] encouraged citizens of [[Therunin]] to consider ways to improve the wealth of the nation and among those put forward was a suggestion for improving the docks to greatly increase the yield from the dredging. 
## Powers
### Wreckage of the past
The [[Sinecure|sinecure]] provides eight ingots of crafting [[Materials|materials]] to the Dredgemaster each season, to be used as they see fit.
### [[Ministry]]
The Dredgemaster also has access to a [[Ministry]] - they can fund thorns and other mercenaries to raid across the Feverwater which would allow the dredging efforts to recover more goods. The Dredgemaster makes their decision how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.

## [[Appointment]]
The [[Dredgemaster of Feverwater]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Navarr]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the Imperial Senate instead.
The title can be held by a [[Navarr]] citizen. The Dredgemaster has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Navarr [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Dredging the Feverwater
The Feverwater is a vast freshwater lake in south-eastern [[Therunin]]. The lake itself is only partially within [[The Empire|the Empire]] - the eastern half in in [[Territory|territory]] claimed nominally by the [[Druj]] [[Barbarians|barbarians]]. The western half is used sporadically by fisherfolk, several of whom have volunteered their [[Skills|skills]] and boats to the dredging. The adventurous Navarr of Soaring Leaf [[Steading|steading]] in Eastring and the fisherfolk of Black Sails [[Steading|steading]] in East Ashes have been particularly keen to offer their [[Assistance|assistance]] to this project.
The dredging uses flat-bottomed river boats and great nets which are dragged through the silt and mud that serves as the bottom of the lake, bringing up the detritus of centuries. This is quite a dangerous undertaking. The civil service referenced the swamp creatures and barbarians that live on the shores of the Feverwater when the proposal was first launched. The small camp that serves as the base for the dredging operation is a magnet for disgruntled [[Marshwalkers]] and [[Druj]] raiding parties, and there have already been several deaths. The more mundane dangers of dealing with problems such as trapped nets or hidden obstacles have claimed lives as well - an especially dangerous task involves diving down to unhitch the nets when they become tangled in wreckage it needs to be unhitched manually or the entire thing abandoned to make the dark waters at the bottom of Lake Feverwater even more dangerous.
The majority of everything recovered here is rubbish, but occasionally recyclable [[Materials|materials]] are brought up along with the stinking mud and remains of past victims of the Feverwater. The shores of the lake have also been the site of regular encounters with [[Barbarian|barbarian]] orcs, including at least one major battle, and so it is common to bring up rusted weapons or armour along with the remnants of old boats - the thick mud at the bottom of the lake has been surprisingly effective at preserving materials that might otherwise have succumbed to the pressures of time.
The dredging operation has primarily focused on the western end of the Feverwater, but as of [[Autumn]] 378YE the first speculative forays into the wild, open waters east of Therunin are being planned.
