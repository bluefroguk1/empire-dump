## Overview
Each of the eight virtue assemblies appoints a [[Cardinal|cardinal]] to represent and lead them. They are generally referred to as "''[[Cardinal]] of (Virtue)''" or "''[[Cardinal of the Way|Cardinal of The Way]]''". Together with [[The Throne]], they form the [[Assembly]] of Nine, arguably the most important [[Assembly]] of [[The Synod|the Synod]]. 
## Responsibilities
A [[Cardinal|cardinal]] is assumed to provide leadership to the priests and pilgrims who follow their virtue. They are expected to be well versed in matters of virtue and [[The Way]] so that they can speak with authority on matters of doctrine. Prominent citizens who are guilty of breaking [[The Law|the law]] but believe their actions were rooted in virtue [[Will|will]] often request a [[Cardinal|cardinal]] to plead [[Clemency]] on their behalf, so a familiarity with the [[Law|law]] may prove helpful.
As a member of the [[Assembly]] of Nine, a [[Cardinal|cardinal]] can wield considerable influence over the politics of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. In particular the [[Assembly]] has the power to [[Veto]] any constitutional motion passed by the [[Imperial Senate]]. This allows the [[Assembly]] to uphold their constitutional obligation to "ensure the virtuous behaviour of [[The Empire|the Empire]]".
The cardinal is empowered to appoint their virtue's [[Gatekeeper]], an important position that controls the distribution of true [[Liao|liao]].

## Powers
### Member of the Assembly of Nine
Each cardinal is a member of the Assembly of Nine. As with all priests, they can raise a single [[Judgement|judgement]] each summit with any ''one'' of the assemblies to which they belong. Every member of the Assembly of Nine may cast a single vote on any [[Judgement|judgement]] brought before the Assembly. Unlike the [[General]], virtue, or national assemblies the size of [[Congregation|congregation]] a Cardinal has does not change their votes in the Assembly of Nine - each Cardinal (and [[The Throne]]) has one vote.
### Further [[Scrutiny]]
A normal [[Judgement|judgement]] requires at least three hours of [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] before the voting can be counted. If a cardinal is not satisfied that there is sufficient time for an issue to be considered then they may instruct the civil service to push back the voting deadline for the [[Judgement|judgement]] to allow further [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]]. Each cardinal may use this power once per summit, but only on a [[Judgement|judgement]] submitted by a [[Member of the Synod|member of the Synod]]. They may not delay a judgement submitted by the [[Tribune of the Synod]].
Judgements submitted by the [[Tribune of the Synod]] may not be extended nor may a judgement be delayed beyond the end of the current summit in which it was submitted. This power must be used before the judgement reaches its deadline - once that deadline is passed it cannot be changed. A judgement may still pass with primacy at any time, regardless of any change of deadline.
The limitation on this legal power is on the title, not the occupant. If a new citizen is elected to the title, they cannot use the ability that summit if it has already been used.
### Appoint the [[Gatekeeper]]
Each of the seven cardinals of virtue are responsible for appointing the [[Gatekeeper]] of their assembly. The cardinal is entitled to appoint a new [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]] at any summit where they are elected or re-elected. Once chosen, the cardinal has no formal power to influence the [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]] who may only be revoked by formal judgement by the appropriate assembly of the [[Synod]].
The gatekeeper is an important position, entrusted with choosing who [[Will|will]] receive [[True liao|True Liao]]. It is traditional for the cardinal to appoint a citizen from another nation to be the gatekeeper of their Virtue wherever possible. This practice is considered important to ensure that the gatekeeper is able to act independently of the cardinal. Cardinals who ignore this custom risk censure by the rest of the Synod.
The [[Cardinal of the Way|Cardinal of The Way]] does not appoint a gatekeeper. Instead, they are responsible for appointing the [[Conscience of the Senate]].
### Virtuous Appointments
Some cardinals are also responsible for appointing other titles, such as the Curator of the Printer's [[Guild]] Museum, a [[Sinecure]] appointed by the [[Cardinal of Prosperity|cardinal of Prosperity]].
Where a cardinal is responsible for appointing a title, that title can be reappointed whenever a new cardinal is chosen.
## [[Appointment]]
Cardinals, Preaching, and SinecuresA cardinal must be a member of the assembly they lead. This means that if a cardinal changes assembly (such as by preaching in [[Downtime|downtime]]) they immediately forfeit the title. Likewise, there is a rare situation where someone without a [[Congregation]] gains membership of an assembly through the votes granted by a [[Sinecure]]. If such a character becomes cardinal, they lost custodianship of their [[Sinecure|sinecure]] (because an individual can only have one [[Imperial Title]] at a time), stop being a member of the assembly, and stop meeting the criteria for being cardinal, forfeiting the title.
Each cardinal is appointed by the appropriate [[Virtue assembly|virtue assembly]]. Only a member of the virtue assembly can serve as its cardinal. Selection is by a judgement of [[Appointment]] raised by the Tribune in the standard manner.
The laws for [[Imperial Elections]] state that, if eligibility to vote in an election is restricted in some way, then you cannot vote if you were eligible to vote in an equivalent but different election in the last twelve months. For example, if you were eligible to vote for the Cardinal of [[Prosperity]] at the [[Winter]] Solstice - and you change faith to be part of the [[Ambition]] assembly - you cannot legally vote for the election of the [[Cardinal of Ambition]] until twelve months have passed from the date of the first election. 
The elections for the cardinals are considered to be legally equivalent positions restricted by virtue. This means that if you change your virtue assembly then you must abstain from voting in a election if it occurs less than four [[Events|events]] after the previous election in your previous virtue assembly. If you are in any doubt about your eligibility then you should consult the Tribune, or [[Merlot]] the civil service overseer of elections who can advise you.
The judgement to appoint a cardinal [[Will|will]] typically close at 6pm on the Saturday of the summit. These times may differ if an unscheduled [[Appointment|appointment]] is required but there are always at least three hours for nominations and three hours for voting. After that time, the candidate with the most support is declared cardinal.
A cardinal serves until the next election for the title. A cardinal can be revoked by the [[General Assembly]], or by the appropriate virtue assembly.
