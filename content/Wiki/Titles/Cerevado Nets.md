## Overview
The [[Cerevado Nets]] are located along the banks of the Scorrero by the Cerevado Rapids in eastern Lucksprings, in the Freeborn Territory of [[Segura]]. Custodianship of the Cerevado Nets grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Ilium]].
The Nets were established by motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] at the Winter Solstice 384YE, following the ambitious plans of Ottilie i Malune i [[Erigo]].
## The Resource
The [[Scorrero Nets]] are a massive series of poles and nets established along the banks of the Scorrero in northernmost Oranseri, [[Feroz]]. Years ago, the Freeborn discovered that the river was washing tiny amounts of ilium down from The Mountains. Once they realised that a king's ransom was sailing down the river and being swept out to sea, a plan was formed to capture the wealth before it could be lost. Vast nets were built that could be deployed at key points along the length of the river to sieve out the precious material before it was lost in the deep waters of the [[Bay of Catazar]]. The nets had to be continually repaired and periodically replaced, but in return for such Prosperous industry, the nets produced a regular supply of ilium.
Following the fUll [[Grendel]] occupation of Feroz after the ratification of a treaty in Autumn 383YE, Governor Rahab quickly moved to take ownership of the Scorrero Nets showing little sign of caring for anything other than extracting as much wealth as physically possible from his prize. Feroz was a prosperous land, but the Scorrero Nets were the jewel in the crown. The governor turned the offices of the Scorrero Nets into his palace, allegedly so that he could be as close to the source of the precious metal as possible.
Displaced "netriggers" from Feroz who once tended to the Scorrero Nets proposed an audacious and expensive plan to establish new nets and traps beneath the town of Cerevado in Segura. Back when the Scorrero Nets were first established in Feroz, there was talk of instead building nets and traps near Cerevado - something the locals remained bitter about never coming to fruition. Now, dangerous as it is, netriggers ply the rapids of eastern Lucksprings, salvaging the precious starmetal before it ever reaches Feroz - and thus denying this bounty to Governor Rahab.
Compared to their predecessors downstream, the Cerevado Nets are an even more fraught and risky proposition for the net gangs that work it. In typical Freeborn spirit, these harsher conditions have only increased the boldness and zeal of the hardy souls that work the rapids - and, many say, the rivalries between them for who can seize the best catches, for more than just ilium flows down the Scorrero. Gold and other precious metals, as well as the odd item of archaeological, spiritual or Magical value, can be caught in these nets, and ambitious Freeborn compete eagerly and often aggressively for the best claims.
The netriggers and other workers of the Cerevado Nets have inherited one particular tradition from the net gangs of the Scorrero - if a dead rigger is found in a net, they will be brought out of the river, cleaned and washed, and carried in state back to their own gang. On [[The Way]] every rigger they pass will pause to honour the funereal procession, all of them singing The Riggerâ€™s Dirge, a sad song that laments the appetite of the cruel Scorrero for the lives of those brave souls who ply it for treasure.
## The Bourse Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of ilium which is theirs to do with as they will. If the Cerevado Nets were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Cerevado Nets, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Cerevado Nets comes with a seat on the Imperial Bourse. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an Imperial title that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of Ilium
The Seat has control of a source of Ilium which they receive directly. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 4 rings of Ilium every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all ilium Bourse seats, the holder of the title is deterMined during the Spring Equinox. Control of the Cerevado Nets is assigned to whichever Brass Coast candidate receives the most support from Freeborn [[Fleet]] owners via the [[Tally of the Votes]]. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Custodianship of the Cerevado Nets is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
