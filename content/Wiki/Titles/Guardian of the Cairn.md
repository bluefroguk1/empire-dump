## Overview
The [[Guardian of the Cairn]] is an [[Imperial Title]] established by the [[Imperial Senate]] during [[Autumn]] 378YE. The stones and cairns that make up the crystal henge are quite old, but their use as a source of crystal mana is very recent. Construction and expansion began in late-autumn 378YE and was finished just in time for the [[Winter]] Solstice. The stones themselves were augmented with polished [[Mithril|mithril]], and several cairns were adjusted to help direct flows of subterranean mana toward them. 
The position of [[Guardian]] is a [[Sinecure|sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities
The Guardian has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of crystal mana from the Sylvihrafn in [[Skarsind]]. If the Henge were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Guardian to deal with those threats.

## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The [[Guardian of the Cairn]] gains custodianship of a [[Sinecure]]. The Guardian receives an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Guardian of the Cairn]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Wintermark]] senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.
The title can be held by a [[Wintermark]] citizen. The Guardian has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Wintermark]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Sylvihrafn
The crystal henge of Sylvihrafn stands in [[Skarsind]] near the Hold of Hrafnar in the north-eastern Skogei Glens. The hall and the henge alike overlook the dark forests of Varushkan [[Miekarova]]. It is named for the late Sylvi Hrafn who fell during the Battle of Ikka's Tears; her body joins that of her ancestors among the cairns. The newly expanded circle was originally named the Sylvi Hrafn Crystal Henge, but as is [[The Way|the way]] in [[Wintermark]] the name was quickly shortened to Sylvihrafn.
The henge itself is reasonably old; the founders of the Hold of Hrafnar often performed magical [[Rituals|rituals]] here. When the [[Thule]] [[Barbarians|barbarians]] conquered the Skogei Glens, they continued this practice themselves - there is some evidence that several enchantments designed to assist the invading armies originated among the stones and cairns. 
[[The Ring|The ring]] consists of thirteen standing stones, around and between which are scattered low cairns of carved rocks. The stones are intricately threaded with [[Mithril|mithril]] designs that denote the [[History|history]] of the [[Battles|battles]] with the [[Thule]] in [[Skarsind]] - both the recent invasion and liberation, and older conflicts stretching back to the [[Dawn|dawn]] of [[Wintermark]]. The stones "draw up" mana flows from deep underground, and the crystals produced form on and around the rocky cairns. The crystals gathered here have a distinctive silvery tinge, that the a few scops have claimed makes them resemble tears.
