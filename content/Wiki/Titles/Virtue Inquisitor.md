## Overview
These Imperial titles were established by [[Create Inquisitorial Court|a vote]] of the [[Imperial Senate]] in Summer 379YE. There are eight virtue inquisitors in total - one for each of the virtue assemblies, and one for the assembly of the Way. The virtue inquisitors were established as part of a larger plan to establish an inquisitorial court.
The powers and appointment method of the Virtue inquisitors were significantly [[Amend powers of the Virtue Inquisitors|amended]] by the Imperial Senate in Spring 382YE.
## Responsibilities
The intention of the Senate is that the Virtue inquisitors would form an ''Inquisitorial court'' in conjunction with the [[Imperial Inquisitor]], to oversee [[Inquisition|inquisitions]] and ensure their accountability and transparency. This inquisitorial court is also expected to work with the [[Officers of the Law#The Imperial Militia|Imperial militia]] and the [[Imperial Synod]] to ensure inquisitions are performed correctly.
## Powers
### Inquisitor's Judgement
Once per summit, the [[Virtue Inquisitor|Virtue inquisitor]] may [[Judgement#Proposal|propose]] a [[Judgement]] of [[Inquisition]] that is in addition to the single judgement they may normally raise. The inquisition follows all the normal rules.
## Appointment
Each inquisitor is [[Appointment|appointed]] by a [[Judgement]] of [[Appointment]] in the appropriate [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|virtue assembly]]. Selection is by a judgement of [[Appointment]] raised by the Tribune in the standard manner.
The laws for [[Imperial Elections]] state that, if eligibility to vote in an election is restricted in some way, then you cannot vote if you were eligible to vote in an equivalent but different election in the last twelve months. For example, if you were eligible to vote for the Prosperity [[Virtue Inquisitor]] - and you change to be part of the Ambition assembly - you cannot legally vote for the election of the Ambition Virtue Assembly until twelve months have passed from the date of the first election. 
The elections for the Virtue Inquisitors are considered to be legally equivalent positions restricted by virtue. This means that if you change your virtue assembly then you must abstain from voting in a election if it occurs less than four events after the previous election in your previous virtue assembly. If you are in any doubt about your eligibility then you should consult the Tribune, or Merlot the civil service overseer of elections who can advise you.
Any Imperial citizen may hold this title. They can be revoked by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the appropriate Virtue assembly, and the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
