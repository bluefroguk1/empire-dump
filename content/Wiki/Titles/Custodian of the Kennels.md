## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Kennels]] is an [[Imperial Title]] constructed by the Senate. The position of Custodian of the Kennels is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular monetary income. Work on the kennels were finished shortly before Spring Equinox 383YE. The Kennels of Holfried are in the Region of Holfried, [[Holberg]].
At the Winter Solstice 383YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] authorised an expansion to the kennels, after the graduates of Georgie's House achieved renown for their [[Skills]] in catching rats, increasing the income of the Custodian by 100 rings, and allowing the expanded business to provide trained hounds to purchasers across the entire Empire.
## Responsibilities
The Custodian receives a stipend from the kennels. In return they are expected to offer support and aid to the houndmaster, who is responsible for the day to day running of the kennel. Furthermore, if the Kennels of Holfried were to be threatened in any way it would be their responsibility to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any Opportunity relating to the kennels presented itself it would their responsibility to make the decisions needed to take advantage of it.

## Kennels of Holfried
Built in the upper city itself, the kennels are regularly referred to as ''Georgie's House'' by the locals in honour of a beloved animal belonging to the Withering Gaze coven, who financed the construction. They are a combination of kennels, training school, and dogs home. The kennels take in as many of the cities' strays as they can, and pay a number of young apprentices to roam the streets looking for animals to rehome. Some of the more enterprising apprentices make extra money locating and returning lost pets and animal companions in return for reWards. 
The dogs are trained for a variety of useful roles such as guards, ratters, and hunting hounds, but there is also an emphasis on providing a good quality of life for the animals. Particular emphasis is placed on training all the dogs to attack and kill rats - such [[Vermin]] being a regular problem in the city especially given the spreading of the Morass and the Ruins created during the [[Druj]] invasion. Given recent memories of the siege of Holberg, there is some demand for trained companions who can also protect the city's food supplies.
Following the dreadful [[Curse]] laid on Holmauer Park by agents of the Hag Queen, a plague of rats bedevilled the people of Holfried leading to increased demand for the services offered by the kennel. This saw the sinecure's profits increase and even after the salaries of new staff were taken into account, the kennels' income each season was still increased by three crowns and six rings.
