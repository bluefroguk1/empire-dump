## Overview
The [[Advisor on Orc Affairs]] is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in [[Winter]] 376YE and amended in the [[Spring]] Equinox of 379YE.
The first Imperial orc advisor was appointed at the [[Autumn]] Equinox in 377YE. Even before that [[Appointment|appointment]] there was some controversy; when the position was first suggested, the [[Magistrates|magistrates]] were concerned that there were extensive constitutional problems with the title. "It is the magistrate's opinion that this motion is unconstitutional as the primary purpose of [[The Senate|the senate]] is to represent the citizens of current imperial territories. The Imperial Orc nation does not currently have any territories. Furthermore it is within the existing powers of the [[Senate|senate]] to call someone to address the senate with regards to a particular motion." Following a full investigation of the matter by the Constitutional Court, these concerns were overturned - comparison was made with the [[Master of the Imperial Mint]]. As there was no attempt to give the Advisor any ability to vote or raise motions, the constitutional concerns were assuaged.
Prior to the establishment of the orc [[Territory]] of [[Skarsind]], the Advisor was appointed by unanimous decision of the Imperial Orc generals; if they were not unanimous, the only alternative was for a vote of [[Appointment|appointment]] by the [[Imperial Senate]]. With the [[Assignment of Skarsind|assignment of Skarsind]], and the nation now having the ability to appoint senators, the appointment mechanism defaults to the standard method of appointing national Senate titles.
## Responsibilities
The Advisor advises the Imperial Senate on matters relating to the orcs, both Imperial and otherwise. While they cannot raise or second a motion, nor vote, the Advisor is able and expected to participate fully in the debate that surrounds any Senatorial decision.
## Powers
### Member of the Senate
The [[Advisor on Orc Affairs]] is a member of the Senate. They are entitled to enter the Senate chamber at the start of a [[Senate session]] and participate in the debates. They do not have the power to raise motions or to vote on a motion.
### Right of Address
The Advisor on Orc Affairs has the right to make an address to the Senate once per summit. This is intended to allow them to present issues or concerns relating to the orcs. To use this power, the Advisor informs the Civil Service that they wish to address the Senate. Their address [[Will|will]] be added to the agenda for the next [[Senate session]].
## Appointment
The Advisor on orc affairs is appointed during the Spring Equinox each year. The title is selected by unanimous decision of the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[Senator]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the Imperial Senate instead.
The title can be held by any Imperial Orc citizen, and they can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Imperial Orc [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
