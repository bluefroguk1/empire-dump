## Powers
### Ministry
As a [[Ministry]], the title of [[Broker of the Broken Shore]] allowed the holder to purchase wains of mithril at a set price. The Broker made their decision on how many wains of weirwood to trade during downtime from their character page. Weirwood was removed from, and mithril was placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime was processed.
## Appointment
This title was appointed during the Autumn Equinox. The [[Broker of the Broken Shore]] was appointed by citizens of Urizen who control the [[Mana site]] [[Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the mana site an individual has the more votes they could allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 
Only an Urizen citizen could hold the title. They did not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they could not be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
