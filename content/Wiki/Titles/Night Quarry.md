## Overview
The [[Night Quarry]] stands in Mieriada, in the Varushkan [[Territory]] of [[Miekarova]]. Custodianship of the [[Night Quarry]] grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]], and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[White granite|white granite]].
## The [[Resource]]
The Quarry is located high in the mountains of [[Miekarova]], near the [[Painted]] Caves. [[White granite|White Granite]] is produced here using a technique that fills the air with a fine white dust that quickly settles on the skin. As a result the workers have a ghostly pale complexion until they wash. There is some conjecture that the Ushkan predecessors to the Varushkans used fine powder gathered here to create a white pigment used extensively in their beautiful cave paintings, although they remained unaware of the bounty of valuable stone that lay beneath their feet. 
The massive [[White granite|white granite]] deposits were discovered and exploited by the early Varushkans, and worked extensively for centuries before the formation of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. The Varushkans were not pleased when the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to make the [[Night]] Quarry an Imperial, rather than National, resource; they had assumed that like the [[Granites of Veltsgorsk]] and [[Eternal Shafts of Time]] it would remain under the control of the Varushkan people. When the Quarry, along with the [[Hunt of Alderei the Fair]], were "taken away" from the Varushkans, it greatly tested the unity of the early Empire. According to some historians, the decision was heavily influenced by a coalition of [[League]] and Highborn senators who wished to prevent Varushkan dominance of the early [[Imperial Bourse]]. Some Varushkans, especially those from [[Miekarova]], would like to see the [[Night Quarry]] returned to their control.
During [[The Orc Rebellion]], the quarry was the site of a notable atrocity, an early engagement between [[Imperial Orcs]] slaves and Imperial troops known as the [[Night Quarry]] Massacre. After two weeks of intermittent fighting around the quarry, Varushkan troops and revolting slaves alike were slaughtered when [[Thule]] [[Barbarian|barbarian]] raiders happened across it and took advantage of both sides' [[Weakness|weakness]]. To this [[Day|day]], workers claim to hear the occasional moans of trapped orcs, dying warriors and exultant [[Thule]] echoing in dark, giving the site an unwholesome reputation
Prior to the start of 385YE, the [[Night Quarry]] produced only 26 wains of [[White granite|white granite]] each season. With the completion of the Iron Roads in [[Miekarova]], however, improved access meant they were capable of producing 28 wains each season.
## [[The Bourse]] Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[White granite|white granite]] which is theirs to do with as they [[Will|will]]. If the Night Quarry were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Night Quarry, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the [[Bourse]]
Custodianship of the Night Quarry comes with a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the [[Imperial Bourse]] as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of white granite
The Seat has control of a source of white granite and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 28 Imperial wains of white granite every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all white granite Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the [[Summer]] Solstice. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title.
Custodianship of the Night Quarry is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An [[Imperial Bourse]] seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
