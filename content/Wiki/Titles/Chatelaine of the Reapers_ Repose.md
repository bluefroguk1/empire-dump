## Reapers' Repose
The Repose is a proud palatial lodge bearing the symbols of the Crimson Reaper Cartel; a red rose and green fern growing through a skull, and the Emerald Magpie Guild; a magpie in flight clutching vibrant green gemstone. There is a plaque above the grand entryway, flanked on either side by Butcher's Cleavers that reads "''paid for and built by Laughlan vi Temeschwar, Quartermaster of the Crimson Reaper Cartel and Master of the Butcher's Bank''".
The grounds are landscaped by the finest gardeners of [[Holberg]] and provide the idyllic setting to best takes advantage of the oasis of calm and serenity. Open-air pools of heated water allow those of unquiet spirit to meditate upon the cares that weighed them down in the company of their peers. A well-dressed staff, in the green of the Emerald Magpie Guild and with sashes of the red and black livery of the Crimson Reapers, are trained to support the advisors and physicks trained in the treatment of the mind and spirit who work to help everyone who visits.
