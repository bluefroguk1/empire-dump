## Overview
The House of Barbs was finished in the Winter of 379YE, creating the title ''[[Voice of Barbs]]''. This is an [[Imperial Title]] in the Synod, and grants custodianship of a [[Sinecure]].
The title was established by a motion of the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Spring Equinox 379YE. The motion Commissioned the construction of a gathering place for [[Navarr]] guides in [[Hercynia]]; the House of Barbs. Work on the House of Barbs began shortly after the Spring Equinox 379YE but prOgress was slow. Following a false start in the Spring of 382YE, the Senate eventually approved an extension to the House of Barbs in Summer of that year. Work was completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox. The new extension - taking the form of an extensive wash house - has proved particularly popular with Highborn pilgrims passing through the area.
## Responsibilities
The Voice of Barbs is responsible for ensuring the maintenance of the House, and for representing the concerns of the Navarr guides in the [[Imperial Synod]].
## Powers
### Point of [[Pilgrimage]]
The Voice of Barbs receives 8 [[Liao]] and 16 votes in the Imperial Synod. These votes apply to all appropriate assemblies. If the holder of the title is not already a [[Member of the Synod]], it automatically includes membership of all appropriate assemblies (usually the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Assembly of [[The Way]], and the Navarr National national assembly).
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the Winter Solstice. The Voice of Barbs is appointed by a [[Judgement]] of Appointment in the Navarr national assembly. 
The title may only be held by a Navarr citizen. They can be revoked by the General Assembly, and by the Navarr National Assembly.
## The House of Barbs
The house is built after the style of a traditional Navarr [[Wayhouse]] on the slopes of the Northpines in north-western Hercynia.
It was intended as a place where Navarr guides unable to attend [[Anvil]] could raise and discuss issues affecting them, or concerns related to their role as spiritual adVisors to the [[Navarr People]]. It also serves as a place for Stridings travelling through Hercynia to find spiritual guidance in the absence of their own guides. The House also acts as a point for the collection and forWarding of messages throughout Hercynia and beyond.
The House consists of a central meeting hall, communal sleeping area, kitchen, stables for oxen, and extensive wagon-yard. Shortly before the Autumn Equinox 382YE, an extension was commissioned by the Senate, adding a [[White granite]] wash house which contains several baths for use by travelers, served by the waters of a carefUlly diverted stream. The interior and exterior of the wash house are carved with a beautifully detailed labyrinth design composed of twisted Thorns and vines. Space is carefully set aside among the thorns to record the name of each Voice of Barbs, past and future. The wash house has proved particularly popular with Highborn pilgrims, especially those traveling the Trods as part of that nation's new commitment to defeating The [[The Vallorn]].
Separate from the main compound is a meditation labyrinth, and a secluded funeral grove. The grove includes a small memorial to the [[Family]] of [[Senator]] Rhain who were laid to rest there long before the House of Barbs was constructed.
The meditation grove is the source of some controversy. It is arranged as a labyrinth with eight distinct circles, one dedicated to each virtue. The walls of the labyrinth is made up of plants and bushes known for their wicked barbs and poisonous nature, a constant reminder to those who walk it of the perils of leaving the path of virtue.
At the entrance to each of the eight circles stands a white granite statue of a contemporary figure in a small meditation area. At the base of each statue sits a stone bowl for collections that maybe be freely given and taken by pilgrims, and a copy of an appropriate [[Chapter]] from "''On being a [[Brand]], a meditation on the virtues in service''" inscribed in stone.
The eight circles, from largest to smallest, and the figures they commemorate are:
* [[Ambition]]: The [[Imperial Orcs]] Irontide Bruk, depicted as if charging down an enemy, shield raised smashing open an enemies skull, his other hand bound as if wounded.
* [[Courage]]: The Highborn Lazarus, former [[Cardinal of Courage]], shown giving a sermon, his shield and sword at his feet.
* [[Pride]]: Dušan Otecovna Zlata of [[Varushka]] pointing angrily, his hand on a wand at his hip, back to back with the Highborn Zephraim of Cantiarch's Hold with his arms crossed.
* [[Loyalty]]:  The child Izzy Sumercrow grinning holding a towel. 
* [[Prosperity]]: The Highborn [[Ruth]] holding a blade in one hand. [[The Blade]] is inscribed "''Prosperity is sometime knowing when what you have is perfect.''"
* [[Vigilance]]: Ulric Y’basden with his foot planted on a faceless [[Barbarian]] human, a dagger in one with an expression of innocence. The more vigilant person will spot barbarian coins spilling from the barbarian's hand and Horsehead motifs woven into the tattoos carved into Ulric's skin and rod tipped with the imperial throne hidden behind his back.
* [[Wisdom]]: Rhiannon Fleetfoot glaring while leaning on a staff as if unhappy about being there.
* The Way:  A willow tree under which sits a rock and dagger bound in its roots.
