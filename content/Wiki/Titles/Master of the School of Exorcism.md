### Overview
The [[Master of the School of Exorcism]] is an [[Imperial Title]] [[380YE Spring Equinox Announcement by the Civilian Commissioner of Highguard|created]] by the Highguard Civilian Commissioner in Spring 380YE in order to supervise the [[#School of Exorcism|School of Exorcism]] on the outskirts of [[Reikos#Riverwatch|Tabernacle]] in [[Reikos]].
There was some controversy around the title when it was created. The civilian commissioner had intended that the [[Master of the School of Exorcism]] be appointed by judgement of the Highborn [[National Assembly#The National Assemblies|national assembly]]. Unfortunately, this is in breach of the [[Civilian Commissioner#Commission|restriction]] that "The new title is a national appointment by the Senate." A [[Senator]] may raise a [[Senate motion|motion]] to amend the appointment method of the title.
### Responsibilities
The [[Master of the School of Exorcism]] oversees donations of [[Liao]] to the School, authorising its use in the training of the next generation of exorcists. The Master is also likely to be responsible for overseeing the accommodation and support of visiting tutors such as [[Highguard religious beliefs#The Inquisition|inquisitors]] or [[Highguard history#Archivists|archivists]]. They are expected to deal with any threats to the School of Exorcism, and to help improve the facilities and encourage the study, and control, of unquiet spirits.
## Powers
### Donations
The Master of the School of Exorcism receives 6 [[Liao]] each season. In part due to limitations placed on the office of the Civilian Commissioners, this title does ''not'' provide any votes in the [[Imperial Synod]].
### Gift of the Leaden Toll
A small group of scholars and retired [[Highguard religious beliefs#Stewards of the dead|Stewards of the Dead]] associated with [[Necropolis#The Litharge|the Litharge]] have expressed strong support for the Tabernacle School of Exorcism. Known as the Leaden Toll, they have pledged to provide the Master of the School with a [[Silent Bell]] each Summer, to do with as they see fit.
==Appointment== 
The Master of the School of Exorcism is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[Senator|senators]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments by the Senate#National Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a Highborn citizen. The Master has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Highborn [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## The School of Exorcism
[[Commission|Commissioned]] during the Spring Equinox 380YE by the first [[Civilian Commissioner]] for Highguard, Rhesa of the Scions of Ravensfell, construction of the School of Exorcism was finished shortly before the Summer Solstice 380YE. 
The work on building the school began at roughly the same time as the [[A season of mushrooms|wave of Spring magic]] was transforming Reikos. The regenerative forces unleashed by that magic made work on the school tricky, but prompt action by [[Highguard|Highborn]] citizens helpes to secure the site and prevent any of the agents of the [[Eternal]] [[Llofir]] from taking any more than a passing interest in the site. 
Indeed, those servants of the Rotlord who did approach appeared to be more interested in watching the construction from a safe distance than in attempting to interfere, and on more than one occasion brought small parcels of mushrooms and fresh water to leave as obvious gifts for the labourers. This unsettling behaviour apparently sprang from an appreciation for "''building something new rather than drowning in the past''" - according to one of the heralds who brought these gifts.
Built on the outskirts of ruined Tabernacle, in southern [[Reikos#Riverwatch|Riverwatch]], the School of Exorcism is a set of solid no-nonsense Highborn structures surrounded by a white granite wall. In addition to the central library, there are several classrooms, a scriptorum where new copies of important books and scrolls can be made, two dormitories, and a three-storey stone tower that serves as the quarters for the Master. Following the rejuvenation of Reikos, it is now surrounded by a ring of young trees that hide all save the upper stories of the tower from view.
Several ox-wagons loaded with copies of useful texts donated by [[Necropolis#The Litharge|the Litharge]] arrived shortly before the Summer Solstice, helping to lay the groundwork for the collection that is eventually intended to be one of the definitive libraries on the arts of [[Exorcism]], and the nature of unquiet spirits, in the entire Empire.
