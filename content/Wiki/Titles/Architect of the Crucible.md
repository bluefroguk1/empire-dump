## Overview
The [[Architect of the Crucible]] oversees the Crucible of Fate in [[Zenith]]. The Crucible was originally suggested in [[Winter]] 384YE by Naomi of Virtue's Rest as part of an [[Appraisal|appraisal]] to ''stabilise and restore the [[Territory|territory]] of [[Zenith]]''. It was commissioned by Sagua i'Ezmara, the [[Master of the Koboldi]], during the Winter Solstice 384YE and completed shortly before the [[Spring]] Equinox 385YE.
## Responsibilities
The [[Architect]] of the Crucible is responsible for ensuring the security of the Crucible and the artisans who work there.

The ''Keeper of the Bronze Birds'', a herald of [[Estavus]], resides at the Crucible with their glass aviary housing five birds fashioned from bronze in the shape of raptors, named Alea, Hona, Roosa, Sind, and Forn. The Keeper can be instructed to unleash their birds; sending them to scour the mountains of [[Urizen]], searching not for prey, but for signs of the remnants of star falls. As soon as they find one, they [[Will|will]] bring word to the Crucible, and it [[Will|will]] then be possible to gather the precious metal. As a [[Ministry]], the [[Architect]] can purchase rings of ilium at a set price. The Architect spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and ilium is placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.

The Architect spends their money and makes their choices during downtime by emailing into [mailto:plot@profounddecisions.co.uk plot@profonddecisions.co.uk]. Money is then removed from, and ribbons is placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

Following the [[Mandate|mandate]] enacted by Bartimaeus of Zenith Ascendant the Architect of the Crucible has access to three ministries allowing them to purchase [[Magic Items]] from the artisans and architects who work there. 
It is possible for the the [[Urizen]] National [[Assembly]] to change the theme of one or all of these additional ministries through the use of a [[Statement of Principle]] that achieved a [[Greater majority]]. If multiple such statements were delivered, the one with the greatest margin would take effect.
### Miracle And Wonder
Once each season during Downtime, the Architect of the Crucible can select a single Urizen character with a [[Mine|mine]], [[Forest|forest]], [[Herb garden|herb garden]], [[Farm|farm]], or [[Business|business]] in [[Morrow]], [[Redoubt]], or Zenith, and [[Commission|commission]] the artisans at the Crucible to create bespoke ushabti for them. This will upgrade their personal [[Resource|resource]] by one level. The [[Cost|cost]] is four thrones for each rank the resource currently has (so to upgrade a standard resource costs four thrones, while a level three resource would require twelve thrones). This is in place of all other costs - no [[Mithril]],[[White granite]], or [[Weirwood]] is required. It ''does'' count as upgrading the resource, however, so it can't be done at the same time as a normal upgrade. Other [[Opportunities|opportunities]] that change how a resource is upgraded have no effect - the [[Cost|cost]] is set by the need to create custom ushabti.
To use this ability, the Architect of the Crucible must ensure they have the appropriate amount of thrones in their inventory, and email [mailto:plot@profounddecisions.co.uk plot@profounddecisions.co.uk] with the CID or name and details of the character they have chosen to assist.
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed during the [[Summer]] Solstice. The Architect of the Crucible is appointed through [[Tally of the Votes]] by citizens of Urizen who control mana sites. The larger the [[Mana site|mana site]] an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]. 
Only an Urizen citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the [[Bourse]]. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
