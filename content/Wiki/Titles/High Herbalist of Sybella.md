### Overview
The [[High Herbalist of Sybella]] is an [[Imperial Title]] created by the [[Highguard]] [[Civilian Commissioner]] in [[Summer]] 380YE. It is responsible for overseeing the Sybella Cross Physician's Hall, a [[Ministry]] built at Sybela in [[Bastion]]. When it was established, the expectation was that the hall would give preferential treatment to the [[Anvil]] Hospital & Imperial School of Medicine sodality, but it remains to be seen whether successive High Herbalists adhere to this vision for the Physician's hall.
### Responsibilities
The High Herbalist is expected to supply [[Herbs|herbs]] at a preferential rate to the [[Anvil]] Hospital & Imperial School of Medicine - although of course this is merely an expectation and exerts no legal restrictions on the holder of the title who is free to do with the resources provided by the [[Ministry|ministry]] as they see fit. If the Physician's Hall were ever threatened, it would be the responsibility of the High Herbalist to deal with those threats - but also to deal with any [[Opportunity]] to expand the Hall, or work more closely with the physicks, apothecaries, and herbalists of Sybella Cross.

The Sybella Cross Physician's Hall is a [[Ministry]]. The High Herbalist can purchase quantities of herbs at a set price. The High Herbalist makes their decision how much money to spend during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed.
### The ''Kruidenkenner''
In [[Autumn]] 383YE, [[The Senate|the Senate]] chose to [[Expand the Kruidenkenner Magazjin|expand the Kruidenkenner Magazjin]] in [[Necropolis]]. As a consequence, grateful merchant-herbalists of the [[Sarcophan Delves]] have made their merchandise available to the High Herbalist at what they consider ''reasonable prices''. This additional track [[Will|will]] remain available as long as [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s good relations with the ''Kruidenkenner'' and the Delves continue.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The [[High Herbalist of Sybella]] is appointed by unanimous decision of the Highborn senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a citizen of [[Highguard]]. The High Herbalist has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Highborn [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
## Sybella Cross Physician's Hall
Built in Sybella Cross in [[Bastion]], the Physician's Hall purchases herbs from citizens and provides medicinal support to the inhabitants of Sybella Cross. As one of the richest towns in [[Bastion]], and a central hub for trade, the Hall is ideally placed to take advantage of [[Herb|herb]] [[Traders|traders]] traveling to and from [[Urizen]] and [[Therunin]], or those en route to or from the new [[Gardens of High Chalcis]] in [[Reikos]].
Much of the trade at the Physician's Hall is between private citizens, but the High Herbalist and their representatives often receive first refusal or access to special [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to acquire herbs at bargain prices.
The Hall also serves as an academy for training herbalists, physicks, and apothecaries. While it does not rival the great physicians schools of pre-[[Druj]] [[Reikos]], it has attracted students and teachers from across [[Bastion]], [[Casinea]], and [[Necropolis]] - especially in the wake of the coronation address of Imperatrix Lisabetta.
