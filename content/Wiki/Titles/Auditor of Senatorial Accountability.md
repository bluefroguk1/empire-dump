## Overview
The ''[[Auditor of Senatorial Accountability]]'' is an [[Imperial Title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Spring 377YE with responsibility to investigate the use of Imperial funds by Senators.
The Imperial Senate has responsibility for allocating and spending the treasury. They do this by appointing individual Senators to oversee projects from building a [[Shipyard]] to raising an army. They also disburse funds to Worthy causes such as the [[Anvil]] hospital or toWard the creation of valuable tools for [[The Empire]]. In all such cases, it is the responsibility of the chosen individual to ensure that the funds are used wisely and for the purpose they are intended.
The powers of the Auditor were extensively aMended by the Imperial Senate in Spring 381YE.

The Auditor has the right to make an address to the Senate once per summit. This is intended to allow them to present important information for the Senators consideration.
