## Overview
The [[Keeper of the Happiston Fields]] is a Marcher [[Imperial Title]] created by the Senate in Autumn 384YE. The position of Keeper is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities
The Keeper has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of crystal mana from the associated fields in the [[Mournwold]]. If the fields were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Keeper to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Keeper of the Happiston Fields gains custodianship of a Sinecure. They receive an income of 10 crystal mana each season.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The Keeper is elected by unanimous decision of the Marcher Senators. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by a Marcher citizen. The Guardian has Tenure, and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Marcher National Assembly, and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## Happiston Fields
Entitled in the [[Senate motion]] as the ''Prosperous Potato Fields of Happiston'' (pronounced Haze-tun), the fields are known to most simply as the Happiston Fields, located as they are near the recently refurbished settlement of Happiston in the Chalk Downs of the Mournwold. Whilst these fields are planted with a potato crop each year, it is the scarecrows scattered across them that bring the more valuable harvest. Each of these scarecrows features sturdy [[Mithril]] rods as part of their construction, and their careful placement harnesses the flow of ambient [[Magic]] to cause mana crystals to crystallise from the soil itself. These crystals - often darker and more earthy in appearance than others, though just as functional - are harvested by the folk that tend the fields almost as if they were regular crops, albeit with a degree more care.
