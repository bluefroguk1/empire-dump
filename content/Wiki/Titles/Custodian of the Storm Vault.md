This title lost its bounty of mana when the [[Druj]] destroyed the Storm Vault. 
## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Storm Vault]] was an [[Urizen]] [[Imperial Title]] created following an announcement in [[Summer]] 379YE by the [[Crystal Architect of the Spires]]. Built in Proceris in the [[Urizen]] [[Territory]] of [[Zenith]], the Custodian oversaw the Storm Vault as a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
After the [[Spring]] Equinox 380YE, a plague of crystal-eating [[Vermin|vermin]] saw [[The Senate|the Senate]] [[Commission|commission]] [[White granite|white granite]] wards to help protect the Vault, which had the unexpected outcome of adding additional production to the [[Sinecure|sinecure]].
During the 381YE [[Druj]] invasion of [[Zenith]], the Storm Vault was destroyed by orc invaders. While its position high in the mountains allowed it to avoid the devastating flood, it was quickly overrun and ruined by the orcs.
## Responsibilities
The Custodian had no particular responsibilities; they simply received a bounty of crystal mana from the Storm Vault in [[Zenith]]. 
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The [[Custodian of the Storm Vault|Custodian of the Storm vault]] received an income of 10 crystal mana each season.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Custodian of the Storm Vault]] was selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] senators. 
The title could be held by any [[Urizen]] citizen. The Custodian had [[Tenure|tenure]], and served until they die or step down. They could be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the [[Urizen]] [[National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
After the flood
Currently the Storm Vault is ruined, and so the holder of this title has no powers and receives no production from the [[Sinecure|sinecure]]. If the Storm Vault were rebuilt, (assuming the [[Druj]] are driven out of [[Zenith]]), the current holder would resume their post if they have not stepped down or died in the interim.
## The Storm Vault
Echostorm [[Spire|spire]] is named after two adjacent peaks. "Storm" is a real curiosity within [[Zenith]] - a region normally famed for its clear skies for stargazing - in that it is regularly shrouded by cloud, rain and high winds. Quite why this might be is a matter of some debate, but current theories tend towards a magical origin.
Whatever the truth of it, the Storm Vault was built to harness the magical flows. It consisted of a set of vanes looking rather like a large [[Mithril|mithril]] flower set just about the level of the cloud line (which varies a little seasonally, but is typically below the peak of the [[Spire|spire]]), the vanes were adjusted and tuned to harness the energy of the prevailing conditions - both magical and meteorological.  
Collected energy was channelled down through [[The Mountain|the mountain]] down a conduit, to the vault - which was a delicate mesh of [[Mithril|mithril]] from which crystals were grown. Whilst only a few grew to maturity each season, the nascent crystals glowed and shimmered as the storm energy was harnessed meaning that the [[Assembly|assembly]] resembled an extremely large cobweb chandelier. 
The collector needed careful adjustment by civil servants, and bad weather on the side of a mountain made this a rather unpleasant experience. The role of the custodian was to ensure that the adjustment and configuration of both the vault and the collector were carefully monitored.
After the [[Autumn]] Equinox 381YE, the [[Druj]] sacked the Storm Vault. The [[Mithril|mithril]] flower was torn apart, and the vault itself smashed open and looted.
