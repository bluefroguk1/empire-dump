This title lost its bounty of mana when the [[Druj]] [[381YE Winter Solstice winds of war#Hunting By The Rivers|destroyed]] the Storm Vault. 
## Overview
The [[Custodian of the Storm Vault]] was an [[Urizen]] [[Imperial Title]] created following an [[379YE Summer Solstice Announcements by the Crystal Architect#Construct the Storm Valt|announcement]] in Summer 379YE by the [[Crystal Architect of the Spires]]. Built in [[Zenith#Proceris|Proceris]] in the [[Urizen]] [[Territory]] of [[Zenith]], the Custodian oversaw the [[#The Storm Vault|Storm Vault]] as a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
After the Spring Equinox 380YE, a plague of crystal-eating vermin saw the Senate commission [[Construct Urizen Sinecure Outposts|white granite wards]] to help protect the Vault, which had the unexpected outcome of adding additional production to the sinecure.
During the 381YE [[381YE Summer Solstice winds of war#Valley of Darkness .28Zenith.29|Druj invasion]] of Zenith, the Storm Vault was [[381YE Winter Solstice winds of war#Hunting By The Rivers|destroyed]] by orc invaders. While its position high in the mountains allowed it to avoid the devastating flood, it was quickly overrun and ruined by the orcs.
## Responsibilities
The Custodian had no particular responsibilities; they simply received a bounty of [[Game items#Mana Crystals|crystal mana]] from the Storm Vault in [[Zenith]]. 
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The [[Custodian of the Storm Vault|Custodian of the Storm vault]] received an income of 10 crystal mana each season.
## Appointment
The [[Custodian of the Storm Vault]] was selected by unanimous decision of the [[Urizen]] [[Senator|senators]]. 
The title could be held by any Urizen citizen. The Custodian had [[Imperial title#Term of office|tenure]], and served until they die or step down. They could be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Urizen [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
After the flood
Currently the Storm Vault is ruined, and so the holder of this title has no powers and receives no production from the sinecure. If the Storm Vault were rebuilt, (assuming the Druj are driven out of Zenith), the current holder would resume their post if they have not stepped down or died in the interim.
## The Storm Vault
Echostorm spire is named after two adjacent peaks. "Storm" is a real curiosity within Zenith - a region normally famed for its clear skies for stargazing - in that it is regularly shrouded by cloud, rain and high winds. Quite why this might be is a matter of some debate, but current theories tend towards a magical origin.
Whatever the truth of it, the Storm Vault was built to harness the magical flows. It consisted of a set of vanes looking rather like a large mithril flower set just about the level of the cloud line (which varies a little seasonally, but is typically below the peak of the spire), the vanes were adjusted and tuned to harness the energy of the prevailing conditions - both magical and meteorological.  
Collected energy was channelled down through the mountain down a conduit, to the vault - which was a delicate mesh of mithril from which crystals were grown. Whilst only a few grew to maturity each season, the nascent crystals glowed and shimmered as the storm energy was harnessed meaning that the assembly resembled an extremely large cobweb chandelier. 
The collector needed careful adjustment by civil servants, and bad weather on the side of a mountain made this a rather unpleasant experience. The role of the custodian was to ensure that the adjustment and configuration of both the vault and the collector were carefully monitored.
After the Autumn Equinox 381YE, the Druj sacked the Storm Vault. The mithril flower was torn apart, and the vault itself smashed open and looted.
