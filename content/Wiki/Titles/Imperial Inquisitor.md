## Overview
This [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] was established by vote of [[The Senate|the Senate]] in [[Spring]] 378YE. The holder is responsible for coordinating and overseeing [[Inquisition|inquisition]] in [[The Empire|the Empire]] working with the Imperial Militia to ensure inquisitions occur correctly within [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Although the title holder has no power to limit or direct the use of [[Inquisition]] by [[The Synod|the Synod]] they do have the power to carry out an [[Inquisition|inquisition]] in their own name.
## Responsibilities
The [[Imperial Inquisitor]] is responsible for overseeing and co-ordinating the use of [[Inquisition]] in service of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. They are expected to work with both the Imperial militia and the [[Imperial Synod]] to ensure inquisitions are performed correctly. Following the creation of the virtue inquisitors, they are also part of the ''Inquisitorial court'', which was set up to oversee inquisitions and ensure their accountability and transparency.
## Powers
### [[Inquisitor]]
The [[Imperial Inquisitor]] is an [[Imperial Title]] in the [[Synod]]. Once per summit, they may call an [[Inquisition]] without the need for a vote in the Synod. This is in addition to any existing judgements they have raised normally. This use of the power may be escalated to a [[Condemnation]] just like any other Inquisition.
To use this power, the [[Imperial Inquisitor]] must still place a [[Judgement|judgement]] before the Synod, but it is considered to pass automatically at the point it is presented.
## [[Appointment]]
The [[Imperial Inquisitor]] is appointed by [[Judgement]] of the [[Assembly]] of the Nine, during the [[Summer]] Solstice. 
Any Imperial citizen can serve as [[Imperial Inquisitor]]. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
