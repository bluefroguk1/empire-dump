## Overview
This [[Imperial Title]] was established by vote of the Senate in Spring 378YE. The holder is responsible for coordinating and overseeing [[Inquisition]] in [[The Empire]] working with the Imperial Militia to ensure inquisitions occur correctly within the Empire. Although the title holder has no power to limit or direct the use of Inquisition by the Synod they do have the power to carry out an inquisition in their own name.
## Responsibilities
The [[Imperial Inquisitor]] is responsible for overseeing and co-ordinating the use of Inquisition in service of the Empire. They are expected to work with both the Imperial militia and the [[Imperial Synod]] to ensure inquisitions are performed correctly. Following the creation of the Virtue Inquisitors, they are also part of the ''Inquisitorial court'', which was set up to oversee inquisitions and ensure their accountability and transparency.
## Powers
### Inquisitor
The Imperial Inquisitor is an Imperial Title in the Synod. Once per summit, they may call an Inquisition without the need for a vote in the Synod. This is in addition to any existing Judgements they have raised normally. This use of the power may be escalated to a Condemnation just like any other Inquisition.
To use this power, the Imperial Inquisitor must still place a [[Judgement]] before the Synod, but it is considered to pass automatically at the point it is presented.
## [[Appointment]]
The Imperial Inquisitor is appointed by Judgement of the [[Assembly]] of the Nine, during the Summer Solstice. 
Any Imperial citizen can serve as Imperial Inquisitor. They can be revoked by the [[General]] Assembly and by the Assembly of the Nine.
