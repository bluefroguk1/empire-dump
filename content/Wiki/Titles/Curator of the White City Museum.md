## Overview
This title was [[Construct museum|established]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] during the Summer Solstice 378YE. The White City Museum was completed shortly before the Spring Equinox 379YE.
## Responsibilities
The [[Curator of the White City Museum]] is responsible for maintaining the museum itself, and for acquiring new exhibits. Indeed, the intention was that the Curator acquire antiquities from across the Empire, establishing the White City Museum as a site of Imperial, rather than only Highborn, [[Pride]].
In addition, if anything were to threaten the good operation of the museum, it would be the responsibility of the Curator to address those problems.
## Powers

## Appointment
[[Curator of the White City Museum]] is a national position appointed by the Synod. It is elected by [[Judgement]] of the Highguard [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|Assembly]].
The title can be held by a Highguard citizen. The Curator has [[Tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the Highguard National Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## White City Museum
The museum was established following the destruction of the [[Reikos#Tabernacle|Tabernacle]] Museum of Antiquities by the[[ Druj]], and many of the original parts of the collection were items recovered from the ruins by heroic Imperial action.
