The [[Embassy]] in Cargo means that the Ambassador enjoys the benefits of mercantile support from traders keen to curry their favour. As a [[Ministry]], this allows them to purchase quantities of special [[Materials]] at a set price. The Ambassador spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.
Following the imposition of [[Sanctions]] on trade with slaving nations in Winter 382YE the [[Cost]] to benefit from the ministry increased by roughly a fifth.
## [[Appointment]]
