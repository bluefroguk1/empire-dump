## Virtue's Respite
The tomb of [[Empress Giselle]] stands in the city of [[Temeschwar]].
For decades after her death, Empress Giselle was interred in her [[Family|family]] estates in [[Sarvos]]. Following the [[Grendel]] assault and the sacking of the city, which included an attempt to steal her body, her sarcophagus was moved to a safer location. After much debate [[The Senate|the Senate]] chose to re inter Giselle in Temeschwar. A new tomb was constructed for her, under the supervision of Gant Archama (the [[Senator]] for Temeschwar).
Constructed in the city itself, near one of the two river gates, it takes the form of an open-air amphitheatre, decorated with the motif of the unbroken chain of [[Loyalty]]. At the entrance to the seats a statue of the [[Senator]]'s father, Demitri Archama (who looks so like Gant that several wits have pointed out it could just as easily be a statue of the younger Archama as the elder). He is shown seated, swathed in fur with a stern visage.
The sarcophagus itself rests on a plinth before the raised stage, and the theatrical back drop consists of four large [[White granite|white granite]] panels carved with scenes depicting the recent joint ventures of the League. They show the raising of [[Caricomare]]; the liberation of [[Holberg]]; and the rebuilding of [[Sarvos]] after the [[Grendel]] attack. The final panel depicting the escorting of the body of Giselle from [[Highguard]] to Temeschwar by a company of soldiers bearing the tattered gonfalon of the Brotherhood of Torn Banners, with the Brotherhood's Colonel Iacob Genoshu clearly identifiable as the figure leading the procession. 
Already there has been some wry commentary of the tomb - dubbed "Virtue's Respite" by Gant Archama - that it appears to be less a memorial to the dead [[Throne]], and more a testament to the recent successes of the League and the Brotherhood of Torn Banners in particular.
