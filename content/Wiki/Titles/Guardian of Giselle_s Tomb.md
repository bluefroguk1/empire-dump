## Overview
The Guardian of Giselle's Tomb is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] [[Construct shrine for Britta's body|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Autumn 380YE. Work on the tomb was completed shortly before the Spring Equinox 381YE. The position of guardian is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of [[Liao]], and additional votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. 
## Responsibilities
The Guardian oversees the shrine in [[Temeschwar]] that houses the sarcophagus of  [[Empress Giselle]]. If the tomb were to be threatened, it would be the responsibility of the Guardian to face those threats; likewise should any [[Opportunity]] related to the shrine arise the Guardian would decide how to respond.
## Powers
### Bounty of Liao
The sinecure provides five measures of [[Liao]] to the Guardian each season, to be used as they see fit.
### Voice in the Synod
The Guardian receives ten votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. They may use these votes in any appropriate assembly, following the [[Sinecure#Synod Votes|normal rules for votes provided by a Sinecure]].
## Appointment
The Guardian is a [[The League|League]] national title [[Appointment|appointed]] by [[Judgement]] of the League [[Assembly#The National Assemblies|national assembly]].
The Guardian has [[Tenure]] and serves until they die or step down. They can be revoked by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], the League National Assembly, and the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## Virtue's Respite
The tomb of Empress Giselle stands in the city of [[Temeschwar]].
For decades after her death, [[Empress Giselle]] was interred in her family estates in [[Sarvos]]. Following the [[Grendel]] assault and the [[The sack of Sarvos|sacking]] of the city, which included an attempt to steal her body, her sarcophagus was moved to a safer location. After [[The other empress|much debate]] the Senate chose to re inter Giselle in Temeschwar. A new [[Construct tomb for Empress Giselle|tomb]] was constructed for her, under the supervision of Gant Archama (the [[Senator]] for Temeschwar).
Constructed in the city itself, near one of the two river gates, it takes the form of an open-air amphitheatre, decorated with the motif of the unbroken chain of [[Loyalty]]. At the entrance to the seats a statue of the [[Senator]]'s father, Demitri Archama (who looks so like Gant that several wits have pointed out it could just as easily be a statue of the younger Archama as the elder). He is shown seated, swathed in fur with a stern visage.
The sarcophagus itself rests on a plinth before the raised stage, and the theatrical back drop consists of four large white granite panels carved with scenes depicting the recent joint ventures of the League. They show the raising of [[Caricomare]]; the liberation of [[Holberg]]; and the rebuilding of Sarvos after the Grendel attack. The final panel depicting the escorting of the body of Giselle from Highguard to Temeschwar by a company of soldiers bearing the tattered gonfalon of the Brotherhood of Torn Banners, with the Brotherhood's Colonel Iacob Genoshu clearly identifiable as the figure leading the procession. 
Already there has been some wry commentary of the tomb - dubbed "Virtue's Respite" by Gant Archama - that it appears to be less a memorial to the dead [[The Throne|Throne]], and more a testament to the recent successes of the League and the Brotherhood of Torn Banners in particular.
