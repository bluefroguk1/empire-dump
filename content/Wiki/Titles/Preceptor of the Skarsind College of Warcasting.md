## Skarsind College of Warcasting
Built on the northern slopes of Estermark, the College is often plunged into shadow even during the day. A dour, blocky building surrounded by a wooden palisade houses the staff and students dedicated to training [[Orc]] [[Magical skills#Magician|magicians]] in the battlefield arts of the [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#Warcasters|warcaster]]. 
The college stands in a well defended area, with access to a spring of natural, fresh water, it could easily hold off a small group of attackers for some time. Below the building - and forming part of the cellars of the college itself - is an old mine long since played out at the bottom of which lies a significant mana site that provides crystal mana for use by the orcs studying at the college.
