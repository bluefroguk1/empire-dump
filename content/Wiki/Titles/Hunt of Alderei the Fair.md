## Overview
The [[Hunt of Alderei the Fair]] is located at the foot of the Opascari mountains in the Varushkan Territory of [[Volodmartz]]. Custodianship of the Hunt grants an [[Imperial Title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[Weirwood]]
## The Resource
The hunt is a great weirwood [[Forest]] that was also the site of one of the most vicious battles against the forces of [[Alderei the Fair]], the tyrant-boyar of pre-Imperial [[Varushka]]. At the foot of the Opascari mountains, this vital strategic asset was nEarly burnt to the ground in the wake of the Imperial victory, and said to be haunted to this day. The site is believed to take its name from the treasure seekers who combed the surrounding woods looking for traces of Alderei the Fair in the decades after his defeat.
As an Imperial, rather than national, resource the Hunt is a sore spot for some Varushkans. As with the [[Granites of Veltsgorsk]], there is strong local opinion that the Hunt should be a national seat. After all say the citizens of Volodmartz, it is the Varushkans who endure the darkness beneath the trees so that they may claim the riches of their haunted land. Why is it then that the [[White granite]] and weirwood bounty of Varushka are in the hands of foreigners?
And the Hunt is bounteous indeed. One of the richest resources of Volodmartz, the great weirwood forest was the site of one of the most vicious battles during the [[War]] with Alderei the Fair. The forest was once even richer - yet in the last days [[Of The War]] this vital strategic asset was nearly burnt to the ground. Only quick action by Imperial forces prevented the fire consuming all the trees, and to this day on certain nights of the new moon the living trees are sometimes engulfed in a shimmering copper effulgence that seems to have no natural origin. 
There is some controversy over the name of the this great weirwood forest.  Some say it is named for the three nights of pursuit, when Imperial forces chased the retreating forces of Alderei south-west toward Alderei's Run.  Others that is is named for the treasure seekers who combed the surrounding woods looking for traces of Alderei the Fair (more cynical souls say they are looking for traces of his abandoned supply train, and the riches it held) in the decades after his defeat.  Darkest of all is the belief that Alderei used to hunt Varushkans through the Great forest, for his sport or as part of some dark rites used by the [[Volodny]].
Whilst the eerie Weirwood trees lend a haunted, supernatural air to the Forest, they do not deter Visitors. Many are lured by tales of the lost treasures of the baggage train. Others come following rumours that the body of Alderei himself lies somewhere in the deep woods. The workers are often forced to shoo these "hunters" on their way so they can get their work done. And, from time to time, a hunter disappears forever or is found broken and torn in a ditch - this is Varushka, after all.
Prior to the start of 385YE, the Hunt of Alderei the Fair produced only 26 wains of Weirwood each season. With the completion of the Iron Roads in Volodmartz, however, improved access meant they were capable of producing 28 wains each season.
## The Bourse Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of Weirwood which is theirs to do with as they will. If the Hunt of Alderei the Fair were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[Opportunity]] were to arise related to the Hunt of Alderei the Fair, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Hunt of Alderei the Fair comes with a seat on the Imperial Bourse. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an Imperial title that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of weirwood
The Seat has control of a source of weirwood and receives Bourse certificates to represent that control. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 28 Imperial wains of weirwood every season.
### [[Appointment]]
As with all weirwood Bourse seats, the holder of the title is deterMined during the Winter Solstice. As an Imperial seat, any Imperial citizen may participate in the auction and hold the title.
Custodianship of the Hunt of Alderei the Fair is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
