__NOTOC__
## Overview
The [[Legate of the Imperial Auxiliaries]] is an [[Imperial Title]] Commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Summer 384YE. The position of Legate of the Imperial Auxiliaries is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of valuable herbs.
## Responsibilities
The Legate of the Imperial Auxiliaries is expected to support the Imperial Auxiliaries in aiding the [[Field Marshal]] with the task of communicating during major [[Conjunctions]] through the [[Sentinel Gate]]. If [[The Garden]] of the Imperial Auxiliaries were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Legate to deal with those threats.  Likewise, if any Opportunity relating to the Garden presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of it.
## Powers
### Bounty of Herbs
The Legate of the Imperial Auxiliaries receives an income of 6 drams of true vervain, 4 drams each of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]] and [[Imperial Roseweald]], and 2 drams each of [[Bladeroot]] and [[Marrowort]] each season from the Garden of the Imperial Auxiliaries.
## [[Appointment]]
The Legate of the Imperial Auxiliaries is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. It is selected by majority decision of Generals of the [[Imperial Military Council]].
The title can be held by any Imperial citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], and by the Assembly of the Nine.
## Garden of the Imperial Auxiliaries
The Garden of the Imperial Auxiliaries is in Coursmouth, on the outskirts of the [[Necropolis]], a ring of ten [[Weirwood]] framed greenhouses. Each greenhouse has a depiction of an individual from a different nation on a battle. A set of Herb beds lie within this ring, dotted with benches for reflection, the produce of which is delivered to the Legate in [[Anvil]]. A large obelisk dominates the centre of the garden where the names and deeds of fallen members of the Imperial Auxiliaries are recorded. The base of this obelisk is set on each side with an eye containing the rune of [[Ophis]], above which sits a crown, the symbol of the Auxiliaries.
