## Overview
Each of the seven Cardinals of Virtue appoints a single [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]]. The gatekeepers have no formal [[Assembly]] - but there is often an unofficial council of gatekeepers where they meet to discuss matters of faith and decide on the allocation of the Empire's bounty of [[Liao#True Liao|True Liao]].
## Responsibilities
The [[Gatekeeper of Ambition]], along with the other six gatekeepers, are responsible for determining who receives the precious, and limited supply of true liao. They are expected to choose someone of obvious virtue to receive each dose. Normally, a dose of true liao is used to experience a past life vision, but there are several other uses to which it can be put. Regardless of the wishes of the gatekeepers, the law is crystal clear. The gift of true liao is a reward from the Synod for virtuous behaviour, and the recipient is free to put it to any legal use they wish.
In practice, each [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]] tends to take their own approach to the title. Some act as an unofficial proxy to the [[Cardinal|cardinal]] who appointed them, working in their interests to support the faith. But sometimes they take the opposite approach. When a virtue assembly is split politically or over doctrine, the [[Cardinal|cardinal]] may agree to appoint someone with opposing views as [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeper]]. Some restrict their role to seeking out suitable candidates for true liao - but during the time of [[Emperor Ahraz]] for example, the gatekeepers operated as an unofficial body overseeing [[Inquisition]] and [[Condemnation]], organizing other priests to root out perceived corruption in the Senate and Military Council.
## Powers
### Keepers of True Liao
The gatekeepers are responsible for determining how [[Liao#True Liao|true liao]] will be distributed. The legal requirement for a decision is for a majority of the gatekeepers (four) to inform the civil service of the single decision on who will receive each of the available doses of true liao. By custom, the gatekeepers often seek a unanimous decision but this is not required -  the names of four gatekeepers appended to a written document detailing who will receive each dose is sufficient. Once the decision is made, it cannot be changed; a ruling instituted during the reign of [[Empress Brannan]] following several high-profile murders.
By longstanding tradition, the gatekeepers meet as a group to discuss candidates, but there is no formal meeting organised by the Civil Service. Though they are rare, there have been periods of Imperial history when the gatekeepers have been unable to agree a single candidate.  
Usually, the gatekeepers will meet informally to agree their choices, acting as a defacto body similar to the Senate or the Conclave. This reflects the intent of the laws passed at the time and scholars have noted the similarity with a greater majority in the Synod. But no council has ever been formally established by [[Senate motion]], and attempts to pass Senate motions that share a power between other title holders, outside of one of the five great houses of the Empire, have always been ruled unconstitutional. Many modern constitutional scholars question whether the titles would pass [[Scrutiny]] today. The complex constitutional challenges posed by the existence of the gatekeepers has thwarted all attempts to put the allocation of liao on a more secure legal basis.
## Appointment
The [[Gatekeeper of Ambition]] is [[Cardinal#Appoint the Gatekeeper|appointed]] by the [[Cardinal of Ambition]]. The Gatekeeper must be a member of the Ambition Assembly. Unlike many titles, if a new [[Cardinal|cardinal]] is appointed they may immediately reappoint the appropriate gatekeeper.
The Gatekeeper serves until they die, step down, or a new Cardinal is elected and chooses a new appointee. It is important to note that once appointed the Cardinal cannot choose to simply remove their appointed gatekeeper from office. Only a successful re-election or revocation allows a Cardinal to appoint a new Gatekeeper.
The [[Gatekeeper of Ambition]] can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Ambition Assembly]].
