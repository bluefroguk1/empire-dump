## Overview
Constructed [[Create title Custodian of Ivarsgard Docks|by order]] of the [[Imperial Senate]], work on an extension to the docks of [[Karsk#Ivarsgard|Ivarsgard]] was completed shortly before the Winter Solstice 382YE. The [[Opportunity]] arose as part of a deal with Bedelaar Huisbaas van Eck, and the construction itself was undertaken by the Sarcophan merchants eager to gain access to the [[Northern trade network]]. The docks themselves stand on [[The Semmerlak]], and greet Sarcophan traders from the east.
## Responsibilities
The [[Custodian of Ivarsgard Docks]] is expected to smooth over any difficulties with regard to trade between Sarcophan merchants and Imperial citizens. They also have a wider responsibility to look to the prosperity of the docks of Ivarsgard, and by extension the vale as a whole. If the Sarcophan mooring was ever directly threatened, the custodian would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity]] related to the docks. The continued operation of the mooring, and thus the ministry, requires that relations between the Empire and Sarcophan remain cordial - the custodian thus has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

### Ministry
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Custodian allows the holder to purchase quantities of valuable [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]] at a set price. The Custodian spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed. 
The cost to purchase cerulean mazzarine was increased following the [[Underwater sunshine#Dho.27uala.27s Tithe - Ports|rise of the sovereign]] [[Dho'uala]] which saw shipping on the Semmerlak significantly impacted.
### Ketsov Mir Mozga
The [[Karsk#Ketsov Mir Mozga|Ketsov Mir Mozga]] is a vale in the woods of eastern [[Karsk#Lestasny|Lestasny]] established by the [[Burgher of Ketsov#The Ketsov Family|Ketsov family]] of [[Ossium]]. They are keen to make friends among their neighbours, and send reasonable amounts of [[Dragonbone]] and other forest materials to Ivarsgard, to be exported, sold, or kept by the Custodian as they see fit. This creates a second purchase track, allowing for the purchase of forest materials.
## Appointment
This title is appointed appointed the Spring Equinox. The Custodian of the Ivarsgard Docks is awarded to whichever Varushkan candidate receives the most support from Varushkan owners of [[Mine|mines]] and [[Forest|forests]]. Votes are recorded in private in conjunction with the civil servants who support the Bourse.
Custodianship of Ivarsgard Docks is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## The Sarcophan Mooring
Bedelaar Huisbaas van Eck was keen to gain access to the Northern Trade Network, and proposed a permanent mooring set aside for the use of Sarcophan trading vessels prepared to make the perilous trip across the Semmerlak to Ivarsgard. Establishing the mooring required the Sarcophan to deepen the draft of the waters along the shore of Ivarsgard, and saw them extend several of the quays there. They also established a weirwood warehouse, and a small enclave surrounding it - a handful of buildings for use by Sarcophan merchants and traders.
Following a request from the Varushkan people dealing with the van Eck representatives, the Custodian of the Docks has the ability to purchase large amounts of [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]] from the Sarcophan Delves.
