## Overview
Constructed by order of the [[Imperial Senate]], work on an extension to the docks of Ivarsgard was completed shortly before the [[Winter]] Solstice 382YE. The [[Opportunity]] arose as part of a deal with Bedelaar Huisbaas van Eck, and the construction itself was undertaken by the Sarcophan merchants eager to gain access to the [[Northern trade network]]. The docks themselves stand on [[The Semmerlak]], and greet Sarcophan [[Traders|traders]] from the east.
## Responsibilities
The [[Custodian of Ivarsgard Docks]] is expected to smooth over any difficulties with regard to trade between Sarcophan merchants and Imperial citizens. They also have a wider responsibility to look to the [[Prosperity|prosperity]] of the docks of Ivarsgard, and by extension the vale as a whole. If the Sarcophan mooring was ever directly threatened, the custodian would be responsible for dealing with those threats - but also for making decisions about any [[Opportunity]] related to the docks. The continued operation of the mooring, and thus the [[Ministry|ministry]], requires that relations between [[The Empire|the Empire]] and Sarcophan remain cordial - the custodian thus has a vested interest in ensuring friendship between the two nations continues.

### [[Ministry]]
As a [[Ministry]], the title of Custodian allows the holder to purchase quantities of valuable [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]] at a set price. The Custodian spends their money and makes their choices during [[Downtime|downtime]] from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the [[Downtime|downtime]] is processed. 
The [[Cost|cost]] to purchase cerulean mazzarine was increased following the rise of [[The Sovereign|the sovereign]] Dho'uala which saw shipping on [[The Semmerlak|the Semmerlak]] significantly impacted.
### Ketsov Mir Mozga
The Ketsov Mir Mozga is a vale in the woods of eastern Lestasny established by the Ketsov [[Family|family]] of [[Ossium]]. They are keen to make friends among their neighbours, and send reasonable amounts of Dragonbone and other [[Forest|forest]] [[Materials|materials]] to Ivarsgard, to be exported, sold, or kept by the Custodian as they see fit. This creates a second purchase track, allowing for the purchase of [[Forest|forest]] [[Materials|materials]].
## [[Appointment]]
This title is appointed appointed the [[Spring]] Equinox. The Custodian of the Ivarsgard Docks is awarded to whichever Varushkan candidate receives the most support from Varushkan owners of mines and forests. Votes are recorded in private in conjunction with the civil servants who support [[The Bourse|the Bourse]].
Custodianship of Ivarsgard Docks is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies or steps down. An [[Imperial Bourse]] seat cannot be revoked by the [[Imperial Synod]].
## The Sarcophan Mooring
Bedelaar Huisbaas van Eck was keen to gain access to the [[Northern trade network|Northern Trade Network]], and proposed a permanent mooring set aside for the use of Sarcophan trading vessels prepared to make the perilous trip across [[The Semmerlak|the Semmerlak]] to Ivarsgard. Establishing the mooring required the Sarcophan to deepen the draft of the waters along the shore of Ivarsgard, and saw them extend several of the quays there. They also established a [[Weirwood|weirwood]] warehouse, and a small enclave surrounding it - a handful of buildings for use by Sarcophan merchants and [[Traders|traders]].
Following a request from the Varushkan people dealing with the van Eck representatives, the Custodian of the Docks has the ability to purchase large amounts of cerulean mazzarine from the [[Sarcophan Delves]].
