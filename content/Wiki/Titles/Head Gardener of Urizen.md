This title became obsolete when The Gardens of [[Pallas]] were burned by the [[Druj]] shortly before the Spring Equinox 382YE.
## Overview
The [[Head Gardener of Urizen]] was an [[Imperial Title]] Commissioned in Autumn 380YE by the then [[Civilian Commissioner]] of [[Urizen]], Juliana of Phoenix Reach. The position of Head Gardener was a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of valuable herbs. It was aMended in Autumn 381YE by the [[Imperial Senate]], adding additional responsibilities and changing it from a tenured position to an annual [[Appointment]].
## Responsibilities
In addition to receiving a bounty of herbs from [[The Garden]] of Pallas, the Head Gardener of Urizen was custodian and record keeper for the [[Prosperity]] fund of Urizen. They were expected to use the fund to secure the greatest Prosperity for the nation. They were also responsible for the safekeeping of the Garden of Pallas - if the garden were to be threatened in any way, it was their responsibility to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any [[Opportunity]] relating to the gardens presented itself, they would have make any decisions needed to take advantage of it.
## Powers
With the destruction of the Gardens of Pallas, the Head Gardener has no legal powers.
## Appointment
The Head Gardener of Urizen was appointed during the Winter Solstice, by a [[Judgement]] of Appointment in the Urizen National [[Assembly]]. 
The title could only be held by a Urizen citizen. They can be revoked by the [[General]] assembly, the Urizen National Assembly, and the Assembly of the Nine.
## The Gardens of Pallas
In the absence of other guidance, the Civil Service built the Gardens of Pallas in central Iteri, along the banks of the river Couros in [[Zenith]]. The gardens were carefUlly laid out in such a way that the various beds form the Rune of Wealth when viewed from above.  Likewise, the ushabti that tended the [[Herb]] beds have the rune inlaid onto their faceplates and chests. These ushabti were specially adapted to the task of looking after the gardens - each had a useful gardening tool in pace of one of its "hands", and cunningly made wicker baskets for collecting herbs mounted on their backs.
The Gardens were looted and then burned by the Druj as part of their conquest of Zenith in Winter 381YE.
