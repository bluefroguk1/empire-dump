They were expected to use the fund to secure the greatest [[Prosperity]] for the nation. They were also responsible for the safekeeping of the Garden of Pallas - if the garden were to be threatened in any way, it was their responsibility to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any [[Opportunity]] relating to the gardens presented itself, they would have make any decisions needed to take advantage of it.
## Powers
With the destruction of the Gardens of Pallas, the Head Gardener has no legal powers.

The title could only be held by a Urizen citizen. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General Assembly|General assembly]], the Urizen National Assembly, and the [[Assembly#Assembly of the Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
## The Gardens of Pallas
In the absence of other guidance, the Civil Service built the Gardens of Pallas in central [[Zenith#Iteri|Iteri]], along the banks of the river Couros in [[Zenith]]. The gardens were carefully laid out in such a way that the various beds form the [[Runes|Rune]] of [[Pallas#Wealth|Wealth]] when viewed from above.  Likewise, the [[Urizen economic interests|ushabti]] that tended the herb beds have the rune inlaid onto their faceplates and chests. These ushabti were specially adapted to the task of looking after the gardens - each had a useful gardening tool in pace of one of its "hands", and cunningly made wicker baskets for collecting herbs mounted on their backs.
The Gardens were looted and then burned by the Druj as part of their [[382YE Spring Equinox winds of war#Cascade .28Zenith.29|conquest of Zenith]] in Winter 381YE.
