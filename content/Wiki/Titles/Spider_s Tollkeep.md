## Overview
The ''Spider's Tollkeep'' is an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] associated with [[The Spider|the Spider]]'s Dream that links [[Madruga]] and [[Sarvos]]. The position of tollkeeper is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income drawn from the tolls paid by merchants crossing the bridge across the furious river Vassa.
During the reign [[Emperor Walter]] the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] lapsed as the bridge was allowed to fall into an increasing state of disrepair. Eventually, the [[Cost|cost]] of maintaining the sinecure in the absence of regular tolls resulted in [[The Senate|the Senate]] voting to stop supporting the title. While it still existed in theory - and still had responsibility for ensuring the Spider's Dream was kept in good repair - in practice it ceased to be relevant.
Following the repairs overseen by Avisena i Ezmara i [[Guerra]], the sinecure is once again available and was appointed for the first time in five years at the [[Autumn]] Equinox 377YE. Historically, the need for six senators from two nations to be in unanimous agreement has made this sinecure particularly difficult to assign ... The peculiar method of determining the title's holder stems from the fact that it is connected with a bridge. While it is often considered to be 'in' [[Madruga]], the bridge spans a river and so is legally in ''both'' Madruga and [[Sarvos]]. Needless to say, this sinecure is among one of the most often contested Imperial titles, as consensus between senators from two nations has regularly proved ... difficult ... to achieve.
In [[Spring]] 380YE, [[Grendel]] orcs attached to the forces involved in [[The sack of Sarvos]] made an attempt to take advantage of unusually high flooding in the river as part of an attempt to destroy the bridge entirely, cutting the [[Freeborn]] territories off from the rest of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. They were stopped by the brave action of Imperial [[Heroes|heroes]], and the bridge preserved - and along with it the ability for armies to pass from the south-western Empire into Sarvos and [[Tassato]], and vice versa.
Following the Spring Equinox 385YE, the [[Jotun]] sent raiders to attack the bridge. Despite the best efforts of the defenders, it was seriously damaged to the point where it can no longer be safely used. With no merchants using it, there is nobody to pay tolls and thus no money coming to the Spider's Tollkeep - not until the bridge is repaired at least. 
Repairing the Bridge
The damage to the Spider's Dream is quite significant. Until it is repaired, the Spider's Tollkeep receives no money from merchants passing between [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] and [[The League|the League]]. More importantly, the damage presents significant difficulties to campaign armies trying to move between Madruga and either [[Tassato]] or Sarvos (or vice versa). Any army that does so must immediately stop in the other [[Territory|territory]], even if they still have movement remaining. Repairing the Spider's Tollkeep is not as straightforward as restoring the Sapphire Stair; the [[Senate]] [[Will|will]] need an [[Appraisal|appraisal]] to determine how best to replicate the genius of the suspension bridge's original [[Architect|architect]] without damaging its integrity.
## Responsibilities
The title holder is expected to ensure that the Spider's Dream remains open and in a state of good repair. The actual job of operating the tollbridge falls to civil servants and locally recruited agents.
## Powers
### Merchants' Crossing
The Spider's Tollkeep gains custodianship of a Sinecure. Unfortunately, thanks to the [[Jotun]] attack, that sinecure is not currently providing any money and [[Will|will]] not do so again until the bridge is repaired. Each season the Tollkeep used to  receive an income of 2 thrones drawn from the tolls paid by merchants crossing the bridge; now they get nothing.
==[[Appointment]]== 
The Spider's Tollkeep is unusual in that it is appointed by unanimous decision of the senators of [[The Brass Coast]] and [[The League]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title may be appointed by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead. 
The title can be held by either a Freeborn citizen or a citizen of the [[League]].The Spider's Tollkeep has [[Tenure]], and serves until they die or step down.
In accordance with its peculiar method of [[Appointment|appointment]], the Spider's Tollkeep can be revoked by the [[General]] [[Assembly]], the Freeborn [[National Assembly]], the League National [[Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly of the Nine]].
