__NOTOC__
## Overview
stub
The [[Master of Defence of the Scholars of the Sword Academy]] is an [[Imperial Title]] awarded to a citizen of [[The League]]. The Scholars of the Sword Academy was commissioned by Achille di [[Sarvos]] of [[The League|the League]] as [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] during the [[Autumn]] Equinox 384YE, with work being completed shortly before the [[Winter]] Solstice 384YE. Almost as soon as it opened, the School courted controversy thanks to the decision to include a number of [[Urizen]] sword scholars on the staff. During the [[Spring]] Equinox 385YE, that controversy was addressed in a [[Mandate]] upheld by the [[League]] National [[Assembly]], that led to [[Holberg]]'s [[Bravos|bravos]] being encouraged to study the works of [[Emperor Frederick]] and engage in spirited debate with the sword scholars. It also saw a number of educators from across [[The Empire|the Empire]] employed to teach swordplay and their own particular philosophies. As of [[Summer]] 385YE, the place is bustling, with students from all walks of life across [[Holberg]] (and in some cases beyond) keen to attend. The full impact of a school dedicated to turning out adept swordmasters with a taste for philosophy and liberty has yet to be felt, however.
While the title is officially "[[Master of Defence of the Scholars of the Sword Academy]]", many citizens of Holberg shorten it to Master of Defence.
## Responsibilities
The Master of Defence of the Scholars of the Sword Academy has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a seasonal income from [[The Academy|the academy]]. If the Scholars of the Sword Academy were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Master to deal with those threats.  Likewise, if any [[Opportunity]] relating to [[The Academy|the Academy]] presented itself, they would make any decisions needed to take advantage of it.
