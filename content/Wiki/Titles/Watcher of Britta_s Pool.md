## Overview
The Watcher of Britta's Pool was an [[Imperial Title]] created by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 379YE. The position of Watcher is a [[Sinecure]], requiring minimal responsibility but aWarded a regular income of [[Liao]] and votes in the [[Imperial Synod]] to reflect the many pilgrims making the Visit to the pool.
Following the death of [[Empress Britta]] in 376YE, heroic efforts recovered her body and many of her effects from the [[Thule]] barbarians. The body was interred in the swamps of [[Kallavesa]] while her personal accouterments were placed in a shrine of [[White granite]] in [[Necropolis]]. In Autumn 379YE, a delegation of Highborn and Winterfolk visited the shrine and removed the personal effects of the Young Empress and reunite them with her body in the swamps. The Pool was created to support the many pilgrims from [[Wintermark]] and beyond to allow them to visit Britta's resting place in safety.
