To the tune of 'Men of Harlech' as performed [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjvKZHJeayg&feature=youtube_gdata_player here]


Men of Fenrose stop your dreaming
Can't you see their spear points gleaming
See their warrior pennants streaming
To this battlefield

Men of Fenrose stand ye steady
It can never be said that ye
For the battle were not ready
Marchers never yield

From the hills rebounding
Hear our warcry sounding
Summon all at Mournwold's call
The mighty force surrounding
Men of Fenrose on to glory
This will ever be your story
Keep these burning words before ye
Marchers will not yield
