Fourth in "The  Saga"


The Ritual on the 
''By Nicassia of Phoenix Reach and Eudaemon of Halcyon Spire''

It began on a starry night, 
Talk of the madness of the ,
We were told our time had come,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Citizens were gathered, plans were laid that night,
Shone light on our work so all would know,
With the Twins’ assent, we’d end the foul torment,
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home. 

The Ritualists took up the task,  
Talk of the madness of the ,
To mark out the vital sign,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Gather up the mana: lay it out with chord,
Bring all you can bring to make it so,
Now by Virtue’s light, we must get it right,
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.

The Sentinels took up the task,
Talk of the madness of the ,
To consider every foe,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Highguard played the madmen at our captains’ word,
The Cultist’s dance performed just so,
Sword and rod and shield were bound to make them yield,
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.

The Urizen went out the gate,
Talk of the madness of the ,
Now to use what they had learned,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Madmen rushed the circle as we laid it down,
As inside, so without, we fought the foe,
For our blood they cried, even as they died.
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.

With our Archmage at the fore,
Talk of the madness of the ,
And the General close at hand,
Bring to bear Poise and Arete both:
Egregore stepped forward to the circle’s heart, 
As Eudaemon pulled the magic’s flow, 
Nicassia repelled them, Vulpes struck them down, 
To make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.

Now don’t rest your mind too soon,
Talk of the madness of the ,
Though a great wound has been healed,
Bring to bear Poise and Arete both:
Peace is settling gently, minds are whole again, 
But this is not over we all know,
We have work to do and we must stay true,
To make Spiral a place we’ll once again call home.
