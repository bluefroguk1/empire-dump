## Description
The covenstone known as The Flickering Flame draws upon the Realm of Night to empower a coven with additional capacity for performing rituals, drawing upon the bonds created between members of the coven. 

These are often crafted to resemble a flaming torch that can be held aloft during ceremonies, some are actually lit during a ritual. Others contain a lightstone to give the effect of light coming from within, ebbing and flowing, revealing and disappearing. Each of the [[runes]] associated with Night are equally likely to be incorporated into such an item.



## Rules

* Effect: Once per day the coven may perform a Night ritual that does not count towards their daily limit of rituals performed.
* Materials: Crafting the Flickering Flame requires five ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], five measures of [[Materials#Iridescent_Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], three ingots of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and six measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.

Nothing is ever as it seems with the rituals of Night, flights of passion wax and wane as secrets transform into mysteries.
