## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 .

The ritual also requires the participation of up to three additional characters, who must be present throughout, and must be both aware and willing. 



### Effects
When the ritual is complete, each of up to three participants sacrifices one global hit for the duration of the [[enchantment]]. These hits cannot be recovered by any means until the next sunrise, even if the ''Sum of the Parts'' enchantment ends prematurely.

A single target gains three additional ranks of [[Combat skills#Endurance|Endurance]]. Participants in this ritual cannot also be the target of this ritual, although contributors can be either participants or targets.

The participants contributing endurance experience the [[roleplaying effects|roleplaying effect]] of lethargy and tiredness. By contrast, the target of the ritual experiences the roleplaying effect of being infused with great waves of energy and vitality that fill them with confidence in their abilities, especially their ability to lead others. 



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 10 and will require an additional three participants to sacrifice a global hit. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description
This ritual builds on Autumn concepts that an individual can exert greater power if they are part of a group. It draws vitality from the participants and transfers it to the target, creating a champion whose strength is drawn from their supporters. Interestingly, the lethargy that overcomes those contributing their health and vitality to the target can be overcome by the vital nature of those with [[briar]] lineage, making them excellent contributors to this ritual.

The ritual was proposed by the famously bellicose [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Varushka magical traditions#Cabalists|cabalist]], Juha, known as ''The Cave Spider'' due to his decision to live alone in underground caverns rather than among his fellow magicians. Some say he wanted it because he was simply too lazy to attend battles in person and preferred to send an empowered apprentice in his stead. A more charitable interpretation might point to the well known tale of the Cave Spider's early life. Born with strong Ushka blood and with a physique more suited to study than battle, his mother dead in childbirth and his father a distant and unhappy [[Varushka military concerns|Schlacta]] known for his strength and power - perhaps it is no surprise that Juha expressed an interest in the enhancement of vitality such as this ritual provides. 

This was the first ritual contributed to [[Formulaic_ritual#Imperial_Lore_and_the_Ritual_List|Imperial Lore]] by [[Dean of the Lyceum]] Simargl of the Circle of Zulgan-Tash, called ''the Empty One''. It became common knowledge following a [[Conclave session#Declaration of Acceptance|decision]] of the [[Imperial Conclave]] and added to Imperial lore by a [[Add "Sum of the Parts" to Imperial Lore|motion of the senate]] in Summer 377YE.

## Common Elements
As with many rituals that involve transference of power or enhancement of strength, a goblet of wine, loaf of bread or other consumable passed from hand to hand between the participants contributing their health and the recipient are very appropriate. As a ritual developed by Varushkan magicians, promises of fealty are also appropriate, as is the giving of gifts between the participants; a [[Navarr]] magician might instead draw some blood from each of those contributing health and use it to paint the target or mix it with something that is the consumed.

The runes [[Lann]], [[Rhyv]] and [[Verys]] are all appropriate - although the rune [[Queros]] would also be appropriate to targets who have a hierarchical relationship to one another. The character [[The Captain]] or [[The Bishop]] might be appropriate for dramaturgy, as may evocations of creatures such as wolves who stand as symbols of the strength of a group.
