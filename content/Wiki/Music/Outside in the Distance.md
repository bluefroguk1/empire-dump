Original Song: Searchlights by The Levellers - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C-n6T4gZGc
New lyrics by Richard East.
Verse 1
I see a [[Forest|forest]] where there was a home before
The flowers in [[The Garden|the garden]] have crept in through [[The Door|the door]]
Oh aye, the beauty that I could bring to you
But [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] I hear something coming through
Oh I said, [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] there is something coming through.
Verse 2
Here, beyond the weir, the water's turning black
Broceliande stands spear in hand just to turn it back
Oh how we keep your petty kingdoms well imbued
But [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] I hear something coming through
Oh I said, [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] there is something coming through.
Chorus
And [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] where your wardens won't go
A child is standing vigil for a home he'll never know
The bushes start a-rustling, so he paints his face with woe
And whispers "This is the last of my show..."
Verse 3
A [[Crossroads|crossroads]] is no [[Crossroads|crossroads]] when there's but one route to take
Your fantasy of peace [[Will|will]] cease a pace beyond your [[Gate|gate]]
I think these things as I walk down this tree-lined avenue
And outside in the distance I hear something coming through
Oh I said, outside in the distance there is something coming through.
Chorus
