New lyrics by Richard East.
Verse 1
I see a forest where there was a home before
The flowers in the garden have crept in through the door
Oh aye, the beauty that I could bring to you
But [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] I hear something coming through
Oh I said, [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] there is something coming through.
Verse 2
Here, beyond the weir, the water's turning black
Broceliande stands spear in hand just to turn it back
Oh how we keep your petty kingdoms well imbued
But [[Outside in the Distance|outside in the distance]] I hear something coming through
Oh I said, outside in the distance there is something coming through.
Chorus
And outside in the distance where your wardens won't go
A child is standing vigil for a home he'll never know
The bushes start a-rustling, so he paints his face with woe
And whispers "This is the last of my show..."
Verse 3
A crossroads is no crossroads when there's but one route to take
Your fantasy of peace will cease a pace beyond your gate
I think these things as I walk down this tree-lined avenue
And outside in the distance I hear something coming through
Oh I said, outside in the distance there is something coming through.
Chorus
