To the tune of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW3MCrLGG0E Malo Ja]. Lyrics by Jude.
Helper files:
Full harmony: [[File:Songs to keep the dark away - full.mp3]]
Part by part lines. Please note that these were recorded at different times so they are in different keys. The Sop and Bass are in the key the [[Music|music]] is written in, the other two are in a more comfortable key to sing in.
Tune: [[File:Malo-sop.mp3]]
Alto: [[File:Malo-alto-words.mp3]]
Tenor: [[File:Malo-tenor-words.mp3]] (This has been tweaked for a woman to sing, some of the notes are up the octave, esp the oompahs).
Bass: [[File:Malo-bass.mp3]]
Hey!
Let the winds rage and roar
Wolves may howl at the door
Here inside the fire burns bright
Stay with me tonight
Hey!
Oom pa oom pa oom pa oom pa oom pa oom pa paaaa!
No need to fear the storm
Love will keep us warm
Snows may melt, rivers rise 
lightning split the stormy skies 
Here inside etc 
Raise your glass, toast with me 
Singing loud and joyously 
Here inside etc.
All the night sing and play
Tunes to keep the dark away
Here inside etc. 
Leave the fire, come with me
Love me sweet and tenderly 
Here inside etc.
