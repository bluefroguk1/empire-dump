A great song to sing about the March from Dawn - also highly suitable when you want to have a stab at any Marcher that develops airs of being better than the rest of us!
Sheet [[Music|music]] available [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/Rebel%20March.pdf here]
The first half of each verse is the same every time - so a great one for everyone to join in with, there!
Original song 'Thaney' by Karine Polwart. Words by Jude.
Rise up now and break your shackles
Join us as we march along
Sister side by side with brother
Till we march ten thousand strong
I shall have no lord and master
Sitting in his halls of stone
Sow no corn and reap no harvest
But for land that's ours alone
Rise up now and break your shackles
Join us as we march along
Sister side by side with brother
Till we march ten thousand strong
I shall wear no leash and collar
I shall be no rich man's hound
Let the scraps from off his table
Lie uneaten on the ground
Rise up now and break your shackles
Join us as we march along
Sister side by side with brother
Till we march ten thousand strong
Never more we'll bow and curtsy 
Never more we'll bend the knee 
Ours will be a bond of equals
Forged in trust and loyalty
Rise up now and break your shackles
Join us as we march along
Sister side by side with brother
Till we march ten thousand strong
You who serve a cruel master
You who long to be set free
Take the yoke from off your shoulders
Rise up now and follow me
Rise up now and break your shackles
Join us as we march along
Sister side by side with brother
Till we march ten thousand strong
Raise your head and raise the banner
Fall in now behind the drum
Foes shall quail and tyrants tremble
As they hear the Marchers come
