-------------------
An gcuirfea fios orm  [Dm G Dm]
Am mbeadh aithne gat orm [Dm G Dm]
Mâ€™uisci, croi gach crann [F G Dm]
An gcuirfea fios orm [G Dm]
I can see your hearts... [G Dm]
Sorrow breaks a braver man apart... [F G]
I send sorrow to the Vallarn enemy...  [Dm G]
For it is no use to me... [Dm G]
Keep your sorrow from the way... [F Dm]
We will return... [G]
When the dance... [Dm]
When the journey is ended... [G Dm]
Chuiris cros I lar an bhothair dom [Dm G Dm]
Lamh na gcarad in am a ghatair dom [Dm G Dm]
Feach doimhin isteach id shuile gorm [F G Dm] 
Navarr Navarr [C G Dm]
Translation:
Would you search me out
Would you recognize me
My waters, the heart of every tree
Would you look for me
I can see your hearts... 
Sorrow breaks a braver man apart... 
I send sorrow to the Vallarn enemy... 
For it is no use to me... 
Keep your sorrow from the way... 
We will return... 
When the dance... 
When the journey is ended...
You placed a sign on the road to guide me
A hand of friendship in a time of need
I look deep into your blue eyes
Navarr Navarr
