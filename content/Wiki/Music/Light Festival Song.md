Words by Claire Sheridan, tune by Claire Sheridan and Aneurin Redman-White.  [https://soundcloud.com/herecosyouare-1/light-festival-song] recording
Some rediscovered lyrics arranged by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach and Eudaemon of Halcyon [[Spire]] for the Light Festival YE379
Fear not the darkness,
We will bring light,
Push back the shadows,
See them flee before us.
Bright lamps and candle-flame,
We will bring light,
Our own stars to guide us,
Lighting all before us.
Lightstones of The Mountains, 
We will bring light,
There need be no darkness,
Light [[The Way]] before us.
Guardians of [[The Empire]],
We will bring light,
Push back our enemies,
See them flee before us.
Fear not the darkness,
We will bring light,
Push back the shadows,
See them flee before us.
