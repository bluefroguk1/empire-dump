In the halls of old Terunael
Under floors of sundered stone
Crawl the roots of our ancient foe
Conquered all, that dark [[Vallorn]].
In the streets once loud with voices
Now the quiet of sylvan deeps
Not a song but the buzz of insects
Conquered all, that cruel [[Vallorn]].
Along the walls long left unguarded
The winding vines and briars grow
The once great gates now hanging broken
Conquered all, that wild [[Vallorn]].
Atop the [[Spires|spires]] of gleaming silver
Once seat of powers beyond our ken
Nothing left but rot and [[Ruin|ruin]]
Conquered all, that rank [[Vallorn]].
Those ancient tomes of boundless knowledge
Lost to all forever more
Now but dust, long left to moulder
Conquered all, that foul [[Vallorn]].
In the hearths once bright and blazing
There the beasts have made their beds
Even here the dark encroaches
Conquered all, that vile Vallorn.
But when we dance the dance together
All things can and [[Will|will]] be done
We'll reclaim those age old wonders
Conquering all that fell Vallorn.
