This is a love song by Henry Lawes (1595 â€“ 1662), imploring the lover to stay. It is best [[Sung]] accompanied if possible.
A pdf of the tune, bass line and words can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/2/23/Sweet_Stay_Awhile.pdf here]. 
[[Sweet, Stay Awhile]]; why do you rise?
The light you see comes from your eyes;
The day breaks not; it is my heart;
To think that I from you must part!
Oh stay, or else my joys must die
And perish in their infancy!
Oh let me die on this fair breast,
Far sweeter than [[The Phoenix]] nest;
Love, raise desire with thy sweet charms
Within the centre of her arms
And let those blissful kisses cherish
My youthful joys which else would perish!
