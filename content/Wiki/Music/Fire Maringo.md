Tune

Lift him up and carry him along,
''Fire Marengo, fire away,''
Send him down where he belongs,
''Fire Marengo, fire away.''
Stow him down in the hold below,
One more turn and then we'll go
Ease him down and let him lay,
One more turn and then we're away
When I gets back to the old Brass Coast
I'll pass a line to the one I missed most
I'll haul her high, I'll haul her low,
I'll bust her blocks and make her go
Isn't she a pretty little craft,
Hot shot to the fore and rounded in the aft
Screw the cotton, screw it down
Let's get the hell from Sirroc town
Lift him up and carry him along,
Send him down where he belongs.
