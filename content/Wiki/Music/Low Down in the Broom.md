Suggested filk, replace "the broom" with "the reeds".
1. It was last Monday morning, the day appointed was
For me to go down to the broom to meet my own true love 
So bright and pleasant was the day he bore my company 
And it's [[Low Down in the Broom|low down in the broom]], waiting in the broom for me
2. I looked over my left shoulder to see what I could see
And there I spied my own true love come running down to me 
His heart so brisk and bonny to bear my company
And it's [[Low Down in the Broom|low down in the broom]], waiting in the broom for me
3. I took hold of his hand and gaily sang my heart
And now that we're together I know we never shall part
Oh no, my love no never, such a thing could never be
And it's [[Low Down in the Broom|low down in the broom]], waiting in the broom for me
