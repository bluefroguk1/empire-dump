This is a traditional Marcher song about standing stones. Some scholars believe it takes as its inspiration the Silent Giant, a standing stone near the village of Hay in [[Mitwold]].
Words by Jude and Daisy. Recording of this song is [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/[[Music]]/daisy/dolmen.mp3 here].
Sheet music is available [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/Silent%20Giants.pdf here]
The [[Silent Giants]]
They stand so proud, they stand so still
Those silent figures on the hill
Shale and granite, chalk and lime
Bent double by the weight of time
There beneath the empty sky
They see the people passing by
Wind and sunshine, hail and snow
They wait as seasons come and go
In their shadow, by their feet
Children play and true loves meet
Sons and daughters, friends and foes
Watched by eyes that never close
Between them grass and flowers grow
For what they they wait no one can know
[[Dawn]] and twilight, night and day
They wait the turning years away
Some say upon Midsummer's night
They walk when moon and stars are bright
Come the dawn no trace you'll find
But the [[Footprints]] left behind
The time will come they'll wake again
To Walk once more on hill and fen
Till then they stand so proud and still
Those silent giants on the hill
