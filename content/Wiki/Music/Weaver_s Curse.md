Chorus:
Warp and wind, shift and spin
Weaving thread thick and thin
Red as blood and black as sin
Working at the loom
Saw you ride in [[Dawn|dawn]]'s first light
Shining in your armour bright
How I loved my new made knight
Working at the loom
Chorus:
Warp and wind, shift and spin
Weaving thread thick and thin
Red as blood and black as sin
Working at the loom
Proud to weave the banners you bore
Though my hands were red and sore
Never loved so much before
Working at the loom
Chorus:
Warp and wind, shift and spin
Weaving thread thick and thin
Red as blood and black as sin
Working at the loom
For a maid my love you spurned
When at last the truth I learned
How my heart with vengeance burned
Working at the loom
Chorus:
Warp and wind, shift and spin
Weaving thread thick and thin
Red as blood and black as sin
Working at the loom
Weave a [[Curse|curse]] in silken thread
May this cloth be soaked in red
May your foeman strike you dead
Working at the loom
Chorus:
Warp and wind, shift and spin
Weaving thread thick and thin
Red as blood and black as sin
Working at the loom
Love her well who loves you first
Love for better or for worse
Else you court a weaver's [[Curse|curse]]
Working at the loom
Chorus:
Warp and wind, shift and spin
Weaving thread thick and thin
Red as blood and black as sin
Working at the loom
