Words by Jericho-Jayne Cobb to a traditional tune  [https://soundcloud.com/herecosyouare-1/to-march-with-navarro Recording] 
First sung by Jericho of the Suns of Couros in 379YE
[[To March with Navarr]]
''By General Jericho of the Valiant Pegasus''
I am a soldier of Highguard
In Bastion I was born
And many is the happy hour I’ve spent
On the banks of the river Couros.
But to the war I must endure,
As others of my nation,
To Reikos fight I'd march away,
To save this Highborn nation.
Chorus- 
[[To March with Navarr|To march with Navarr]]
March with Navarr
To save this Highborn nation
[[To March with Navarr|To march with Navarr]]
March with Navarr
To save the  Highborn nation
The night before we went away
I spent it with my darling
From lowest sun in the afternoon
To the break of day next morning.
And when that we were going to.part,
We lay in each other's arms,
And you may be sure, and very sure,
That we lay discontented.
Chorus....
The very first night we marched away,
I dreamt about my darling,
I dreamt I held her in my arms
And well she pleased my fancy.
And when I woke out of my dream,
And found my bed was empty,
You may be sure and very sure
That I lay discontented.
Chorus....
When we arrived to fight the war
We all were lean and healthy
We planted banners in the soil,
And set our shields and spears
For to the war we would endure,
As others of our nations,
To Reiko’s fight we'd marched away
To free the Highborn nation.
Chorus.
