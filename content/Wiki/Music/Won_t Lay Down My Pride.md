Won't Lay Down My Pride
''By Nicassia of Phoenix Reach''
A [[Sentinel]] went out the gate,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
To battle [[Thule]] Tribes was her fate,
I won't lay down my Pride.
They met them on a windswept field,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
They fought to make our enemies yield,
I won't lay down my Pride.
Their victory won, they turned for home,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
But they would not be left alone,
I won't lay down my Pride.
They met another band of Thule,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
Another Warband, just as cruel,
I won't lay down my Pride.
The bulk of them had gained the gate,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
They must escape 'fore it's too late,
I won't lay down my Pride.
She moved to the back, to steady the line,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
The Orcs struck through the armiesâ€™ spine:
I won't lay down my Pride.
The captives then were marched away,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
And reached the camp by the break of day,
I won't lay down my Pride.
The orcs they kept them all awake,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
Sure that they would make them break,
I won't lay down my Pride.
Said they, "O soldier of [[Urizen]] high,"
Pride, soldier, Pride,
"Kneel to us or else you will die,"
I won't lay down my Pride.
They said, "Look at you, dressed up to [[Fight]]," 
Pride, soldier, Pride,
"A soft thing like you won't last the night,"
I won't lay down my Pride.
But there she stayed and there she stood,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
Said, "All your taunts will do you no good,"
I won't lay down my Pride.
For three long days they went unfed,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
They were beaten and they bled,
I won't lay down my Pride.
And some they cried and some they died,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
And some they joined the other side,
I won't lay down my Pride.
And so the offer came again,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
"Serve now, or not see [[Dawn]] again,"
I won't lay down my Pride.
So she breathed, and with a mighty roar,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
She fought as she'd never fought before,
I won't lay down my Pride.
Tooth and nail, knee and claw,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
She broke her captor's leering jaw,
I won't lay down my Pride.
And one last thing before she died,
Pride, soldier, Pride,
She lifted up her voice and cried,
"I won't lay down my Pride."
"It's enough for me, enough for me,"
Pride, soldier, Pride,
"To be proud and die virtuously,
I won't lay down my Pride."
