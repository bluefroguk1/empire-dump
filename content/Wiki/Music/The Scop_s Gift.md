Words and [[Music|music]] by Jude
A year since the [[Thane]] last strode to battle
Since last his axe and armour rattled
When he slaughtered the settlers and stole their cattle
That [[Night|night]] they drank in the Thane's mead hall
While the shadows stretched outside the wall
And the land turned white from the swift snowfall 
 A black-cloaked [[Scop]] at [[The Door|the door]] came knocking
From out of the dark where the ghosts were walking
He muted their mirth and silenced their talking 
Then spoke the Thane in his cloak of sable 
'What gift do you bring me, to eat at my table?
To feast by my fire and to sleep in the stable?'
'Here is the gift that I trade for your favour-
A pouch of salt I bring you to savour
That your bread rises well and your meat has flavour'
The thane bade him sit by the blazing fire
And eat and drink all he could desire
And the Scop sang soft and he strummed his lyre
The Thane drank deep till the [[Dawn|dawn]] was breaking
His swordsmen snored as the crows were waking
But he drank with a thirst that there was no slaking
Then up rose the Scop from the hearthstone, crying:
'There on the field you left me lying
Down in the dirt with the dead and dying 
'Hear now the song I come to play you
A [[Curse|curse]] of salt I bring to slay you 
For you killed my kin and I [[Will|will]] repay you
'Salt for a thirst that's never slowing
Salt for the earth that [[Will|will]] brook no growing
Till the [[Winter|winter]] wind over your bones is blowing'
A year [[Gone|gone]] past since the great Thane's falling
And his hall's a [[Ruin|ruin]] where the rats come crawling
Lost to the snow, and the grey gulls' calling
