Lyrics by Amelia Crowley, [[Music]] Jude Reid
The fUll notation for the song is below, and the same version in a different layout is available [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/f/fc/Tanner%27s_Hill.pdf here]. 
On a winter's evening when all were cold and still
There came a goodman walking up the road to Tanner's Hill
On a winter's evening without no wind nor rain
A man went up to Tanner's hill, a bard came down again
Once go for [[Wisdom]]
Twice go for fame
But them as go to Tanner's Hill, they'll not come down the same
Mild and misty springtime when all were fine and fair
A bard climbed up to Tanner's Hill to get a breath of air
Mild and misty springtime with Birdsong on the brain
A bard climbed up to Tanner's Hill - a knight went home again
When the ravens circle
When the sky's aflame
Them as go to Tanner's Hill, they'll not come down the same
Bright midsummer morning with the sun up in the sky
A knight went up to Tanner's Hill, his fortunes for to try
Bright midsummer morning with the blossom on the lane
A knight went up to Tanner's Hill and mad came down again
Some say it's the old ones
Some say it's the fey
But them as go to Tanner's Hill, they'll not come down the same
At the end of Autumn as the leaves lay dead and still
There came a madman walking up the road to Tanner's Hill
At the end of Autumn when the year were on the wane
A madman climbed to Tanner's Hill and ne'er came down again
Don't walk the road, love
Don't try the lane
Don't go up to Tanner's Hill, you'll not come down the same
