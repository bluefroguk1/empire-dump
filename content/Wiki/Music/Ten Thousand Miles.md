-------------------
Fare you well my own true love
And farewell for a while.
I’m going away, but I’ll be back
If I go [[Ten Thousand Miles|ten thousand miles]].
[[Ten Thousand Miles|Ten thousand miles]], my own true love,
[[Ten Thousand Miles|Ten thousand miles]] or more,
And the rocks may melt and the seas may burn,
If I no more return.
Oh don’t you see that lonesome dove,
Sitting on yon ivy tree,
She’s weeping for her own true love
Just as I shall weep for mine.
Oh come back my own true love
And stay a while with me
For if I had a friend all on this earth,
You’ve been a friend to me.
And fare you well my own true love
And farewell for a while.
I’m going away, but I’ll be back
If I go ten thousand miles.
