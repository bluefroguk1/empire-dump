This has been adapted by Rosie Goldsmith from [[The Phoenix]] by Julia Ecklar, as [[Sung]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGi2Nt-GTF4&list=PLBlfFnbQDh2ofVU5vlYpM_YxdDX8un6nJ here].
A pdf of the tune and lyrics can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/c/c5/The_Novarian_Phoenix.pdf here]. 
Knight of [[Dawn]] in Richilde’s reign, she was born
Proved true and brave, with a charge so fierce, they won at [[Semmerholm]]
And with all the battles over, the darkness at an end
Novaria stood tall in victory and the Sun Queen called her ‘friend’
With my banners riding so high, my knights all armed in steel
And from my [[Pride]] and [[Courage]] comes the power that I wield
Once around the labyrinth, I died beneath my tree
Now my scions rise on phoenix wings, for all of Dawn to see
To guard in Applefell she built her fortress there
But the soul that never ventures far, in peace begins to wear
No one listened to the Weavers, they’d forgotten how to strive
So when flames took hold of the old heart, left them open to the sky.
With my banners riding so high, my knights all armed in steel
And from my Pride and Courage comes the power that I wield
Once around the labyrinth, I died beneath my tree
Now my scions rise on phoenix wings, for all of Dawn to see
My [[War]] cry rends the morning skies, I am here
No longer sheltered and kept close, now I stride out without fear
My fruit I cast so widely ‘neath, [[The Empire]]’s blazing sky
I led [[The Way]], and I lead the way, to the future and for Pride
With my banners riding so high, my knights all armed in steel
And from my Pride and Courage comes the power that I wield
Once around the labyrinth, I died beneath my tree
Now my scions rise on phoenix wings, for all of Dawn to see
