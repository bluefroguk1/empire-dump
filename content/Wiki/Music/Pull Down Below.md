Sally lives on an old plantation
Resp:  [[Pull Down Below]]!
She’s the prettiest in the nation
Resp:  Pull down below! 
Chorus
Oh Marcher Laddie
Pull down below
Marcher Laddie, Bonnie Laddie
Pull down below
For seven years he courted Sally
Resp:  Pull down below!
And all he did was dilly-dally
Resp:  Pull down below!  (Chorus)
He bought no gowns, he bought no laces
Resp:  Pull Down Below!
Didn’t take her out to fancy places
Resp:  Pull Down Below!   (Chorus)
Sally Brown she loved him dEarly
Resp:  Pull Down Below!
He had her heart so very nearly
Resp:  Pull down below!  (Chorus)
Sally Brown he wouldn’t marry
Resp:  Pull down below!
And she no longer cares to tarry
Resp:  Pull down below! (Chorus)
This laddie now he took a notion
Resp:  Pull down below!
To sail away across the ocean
Resp:  Pull down below!  (Chorus x2)
