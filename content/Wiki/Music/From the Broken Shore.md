[[From the Broken Shore]] we emerge, we emerge
To any who would pirate we're a scourge, we're a scourge
And any who would sail, bow your head, bow your head
Unless, of course, you want to end up dead, end up dead
The [[Grendel]], the [[Grendel]], we come from Broken Shore
The [[Grendel]], the [[Grendel]], we come to bring our [[Law]]
The [[Grendel]], the Grendel, upon our ships' high towers
The Grendel, the Grendel, CATAZAR BAY IS OURS!
[[From the Broken Shore]] we sail out, we sail out
And any foreign raider we [[Will|will]] rout, we [[Will|will]] rout
Through any storm or tempest we [[Will|will]] sail, we [[Will|will]] sail
'Cause the Grendel cannot ever flag or fail, flag or fail
The Grendel, the Grendel...
[[From the Broken Shore]] we appear, we appear
With all our mighty ships we're bringing fear, bringing fear
Because trade or [[Combat|combat]], sailing is our life, is our life
We'll offer you our silver or a knife, or a knife
