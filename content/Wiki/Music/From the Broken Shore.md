[[From the Broken Shore]] we emerge, we emerge
To any who would pirate we're a scourge, we're a scourge
And any who would sail, bow your head, bow your head
Unless, of course, you want to end up dead, end up dead
The Grendel, the Grendel, we come from Broken Shore
The Grendel, the Grendel, we come to bring our Law
The Grendel, the Grendel, upon our ships' high towers
The Grendel, the Grendel, CATAZAR BAY IS OURS!
[[From the Broken Shore]] we sail out, we sail out
And any foreign raider we will rout, we will rout
Through any storm or tempest we will sail, we will sail
'Cause the Grendel cannot ever flag or fail, flag or fail
The Grendel, the Grendel...
[[From the Broken Shore]] we appear, we appear
With all our mighty ships we're bringing fear, bringing fear
Because trade or combat, sailing is our life, is our life
We'll offer you our silver or a knife, or a knife
