Words and tune by Claire Sheridan
A song by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach after the death of Decius Cascade.
Now inside the [[Spire]],
There sits an empty chair,
For Courageous Captain Decius
No longer sits there. 
Decius was brave and bold,
He wore the [[General]]’s sash,
Though it was voted off him,
For his actions were too rash.
He fought our foes with life and limb,
He gathered many friends,
We took great [[Pride]] in Decius,
Until he met his end.
His [[Loyalty]] sustained us,
His face in battle grim,
He took such grievous injuries,
Our [[Chirurgeon|chirurgeon]]’s sustained him!
Bandaged Captain Decius,
Always quick to smile,
He counselled with humility,
He went the extra mile.
Now inside the [[Spire]],
There sits an empty chair,
For Courageous Captain Decius,
No longer sits there.
