Trad. Sir Eglamore, performed by Kate Rusby [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HHLj8rKrZ8 here].
OOC lyrics by Jude Reid
This song is a clear adaptation of the traditional Dawnish song [[Sir Isobel]], which itself has been [[Sung]] about many different knights over the years.
[[Sir Colwyn]] he was a valiant knight
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
He took up his sword and he went to [[Fight]]
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
As he sTrode through hill and dale
All armoured in his cote of mail
''Fa la latten da latten da latten da lanky down dilly''
There came an [[Eternal]] fUll of guile
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
His words were lies and his tongue dripped bile
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
Its gaze swept coldly o'er the room
And spoke on Colwyn's House its doom
''Fa la latten da latten da latten da lanky down dilly''
Then up spoke Colwyn, brave and true 
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
'My kin, this fate I'll keep from you,'
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
'I'll bear it bravely in your stead 
Let this fell [[Curse]] fall on my head!'
''Fa la latten da latten da latten da lanky down dilly''
So on his head the curse was laid
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
Sir Colwyn he was not dismayed 
''Fa la lanky down dilly''
His silks rotted to rags of brown
Though still he strive to win renown
''Fa la latten da latten da latten da lanky down dilly''
A filthy beggar knight was he
Fa la etc
A dreadful curse of poverty
Fa la etc
But he fought on both strong and proud
His back unbent, his head unbowed 
Fa la etc
In battle he commanded well
Fa la etc
No single Dawnish soldier fell
Fa la etc
But through his curse he lived alone
Condemned to dwell in pain alone
Fa la etc
A year passed ere his curse was done
Fa la etc
His pains were Healed, his quests were won
Fa la etc
So through [[The Empire]] spread his fame
That all shall know our hero's name
Fa la etc
