New lyrics by Jamie Wakefield
[[Chords]]: Verse – Am G Dm G Dm Am; Chorus/Coda – Am C G
Verse 1
My dreams. Awake. A call
A cry breaks over the wall 
On the west wall
We’ll be free
On the west wall
You and me.
Verse 2
Once more, the spawn hath come
Our hearts won’t be undone
On the west wall
We’re fighting free
On the west wall
[[Heroes]] we.
Chorus
One beat
One heart 
One time
One call
''(repeat)''
With your sword
In your hand
You’ll rise
or you’ll fall
One beat
One heart 
One time
One Call
Verse 3
And though, our foe draws near
We’ll show these beasts no fear
On the west wall
We’re fighting free
On the west wall
[[Heroes]] we.
Chorus
Reprise verse
'Cause on the west wall
We are free
On the west wall
You and me.

Verse 4
And if my sword should fall
Then who’ll be next [[On the Wall|on the wall]].
'Cause on the west wall
We are free
On the west wall
You and me.
Chorus

One heart

One heart
