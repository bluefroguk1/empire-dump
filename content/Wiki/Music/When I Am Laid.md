This has been adapted from Purcell's '[[When I Am Laid]]' from Dido and Aeneas. 
A recording of the original can be found [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=H3wAarmPYKU#t=47s here] (0:47 onwards). 
A score can be found at [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/8/87/When_I_Am_Laid_In_Earth_-_pdf.pdf here]. It is intended to be accompanied by recorders but feel free to adapt this for any instrumental combination you have to hand. 
[[When I Am Laid|When I am laid]] in earth, 
May my passing create
No trouble in thy breast;
Remember me, remember my fate.
