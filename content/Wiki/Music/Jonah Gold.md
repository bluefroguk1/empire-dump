Stories of [[Jonah Gold]] are told throughout [[The Marches|the Marches]], and in parts of [[Hahnmark]], [[Tassato]], and [[Kahraman]]. The most popular tale dates from the time of the Cousins' [[War]], and is referenced in a well-known song that is particularly popular in the [[Mournwold]] - there is evidence that Jonah was born and grew up in the Ore Hills long before the Mourn was fully conquered by the Marchers. 
Jonah was said to be a miner who quarried out metal of such quality that his weapons turned the tide of [[War|war]] for his household. His jealous friend betrayed him to the enemy, and for a heavy purse of coin staged a mining accident that trapped him behind a rockfall where he presumably perished. Superstitious miners say that to see [[Jonah Gold]] presages disaster - whether his appearance causes catastrophe or simply warns against it varies from legend to legend. 
His name has also been given to a variety of apple commonly grown in the [[Mournwold]]. Heavy, green and sweet, with a sharp bite, the "[[Jonah Gold]]" variety is used extensively in cooking sweet pies and apple sauce, and traditionally is buried with miners from the Mourn, particularly those who quarry [[Green iron|green iron]].

Take your pick, push your cart
Make your way to the [[Mournwold]]'s heart
Fire the rock, watch it break
All its fortune is yours to take
Pick and pan, sweat and toil
Carving wealth out of Mournworld's soil
As you work, miners bold
Beware of [[Jonah Gold]]
Times of [[War|war]], long ago
Cousins fought then as mortal foes
Jonah Gold, Marcher brave
Mined the iron for his Household's blades
Found a seam, green iron ore
Held an edge like no blade before
As you work, miners bold
Beware of Jonah Gold
Jonah Gold, took the field
Armed his household with sword and shield 
Won the [[Day|day]], claimed the land
Gainst his weapons no foe could stand
Turned the [[War|war]] for his kin
With his steel they were sure to win
As you work, miners bold
Beware of Jonah Gold
Jonah Gold, none his peer
Sent his weapons both far and near
Jealous eyes saw his skill
Envied him as weak souls [[Will|will]]
Rosie Smith, once his friend
Swore that Jonah's life she'd end
As you work, miners bold
Beware of Jonah Gold
One cold day, down the pit
Shovels carried and lanterns lit
Jonah followed a call for aid
Learned too late that he was betrayed
Heard the blast's fearful sound
Rockfall trapped him beneath the ground
As you work, miners bold
Beware of Jonah Gold.
Rosie Smith, name be cursed
Killed her friend for a traitor's purse
Spent her life, stiff with fright
Saw his face in her dreams each [[Night|night]]
Lost her [[Will|will]], lost her wits
Never ventured back in the pit
As you work, miners bold
Beware of Jonah Gold
Jonah Gold wanders still
Haunts the [[Mine|mine]] beneath [[Mournwold]]'s hill
In the mines, dark and deep
Rotting husk that can never sleep
Face like coal, eyes that burn
Waits for the traitor to return
As you work, miners bold
Beware of Jonah Gold
Some say he comes to warn
Jonah means no true miner harm
See him there, turn and run
Death [[Will|will]] strike ere the shift is done
Mournwold's mines claim their due
Marcher blood keeps the iron true
As you work, miners bold
Beware of Jonah Gold
