Clannad do a rather pretty version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j9HkMBde1o&feature=kp
Simple chords.  Guitarists: If you want to avoid the bar chord, capo 2 and play Dm Am.
-------------------
[Em] [[By Chance It Was|By chance it was]] I met my love 
It did me much surprise 
Down by a shady myrtle grove 
Just as the sun did [Bm]rise. 
[Em]The birds they sang right gloriously 
And pleasant was the air 
And there was non save she and i 
Among the flowers fair. 
In dewy grass and green we walked 
She timid was and coy 
How can'st thou choose but pity me 
My pretty pearl, my joy 
How comes it that thou stroll this way? 
Sweet maiden tell me true 
Before bright phoebus' glittering ray 
Has supped the morning dew? 
I go to tend the flocks I love 
The ewes and tender lambs 
That pasture by the myrtle grove 
That gambol by their dams 
There I enjoy a pure content 
At dawning of the day 
Then, hand in hand, we lovers went 
To see the flock at play. 
And as we wended down the road 
I said to her, "sweet maid, 
Three years I in my place abode 
And three more must be stayed 
The three that I am bound so fast 
O fairest wait for me 
And when the weary years are past 
Then wedded we will be." 
"three years are long, three times too long 
Too lengthy the delay" 
And then I answered in my song 
"hope wastes them quick away 
Where love is fervent, fain and fast 
And knoweth not decay 
There nimbly fleet the seasons past 
Accounted as one day."
