[[Falcon Wings]]
''Written by the Volchitrava [[Stzena]]''
''Commissioned by Thanmir Hrafnar''
This song was commissioned in Winter 379 by the retiring senator for Skarsind, Thanmir Hrafnar, following their successful campaign to have the territory given up by the Wintermark nation, so that the Imperial Orcs might have a homeland.
The song combines a traditional melody from Skarsind with the rhythmic chanting found in Imperial Orc [[Music|music]]. The lyrics celebrate the outstanding Loyalty shown by both the people of Wintermark and the Imperial Orcs, whilst not demeaning the sacrifices made by both as the Orcs earned their new homeland.
[[Music]]: Arranged by Katy Cooper and Daisy Abbott from the traditional Swedish song, "Var det du eller var set jag"
Lyrics: Rhi Swann Price

Long way home, it's a long way home
Far from the land we have known
Long way home, it's a long way home
The birds of Skarsind have flown
The skeins of our Nation, the strongest foundation
For shouldering the burden that Loyalty brings
The skeins of our Nation, the strongest foundation
Sing now and raise the people upon [[Falcon Wings|falcon wings]]
Long way home, it's a long way home
Far from the land we have known
Long way home, it's a long way home
The birds of Skarsind have flown
These scars that we gather, they carve a new chapter
Ten nations in the Empire united as one
These scars that we gather, they carve a new chapter
'Til sleep in Kallavesa when our work is done
