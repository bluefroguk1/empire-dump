Tune trad. Scottish Athole Gathering. Lyrics by Daisy Abbott, Jude Reid, and Kath Wheeler.
IC written by Jennet of Mourn.
Chorus:
Who [[Will|will]] go with [[Gallant Archer|gallant Archer]]?
Who [[Will|will]] go with Sweet Will's men?
He's the flower of the Bregas
And the darling of the fen
See the white rose in his bonnet
See his [[Banner|banner]] proudly sway
His good sword he now has drawn it
And has flung the sheath away
Fighting in the woods of Chalcis
Orcs and monsters all were killed
Highborn, [[Freeborn]] all to safety
Marchers last to leave the field
A sudden rush from Orcish forces
Loud and clear retreat did sound
As the portal closed behind us
Three bold men lay on the ground
Chorus
Up then spoke Courageous Archer
"Marchers we have all to do
Jack can open up the portal
But we must bravely step back through
If they live we'll bring them back
And celebrate our [[Loyalty]]
And if they're dead we'll bring them home
To lay beneath an apple tree."
Chorus
Every faithful Marcher followed
Strong as steady as the tide
Returned into the field of battle
Stoutly marching side by side
Ever watchful, ever onward
Generals, Captains, brave Yeomen,
Scoured the dark and faced the danger
To bring the Cullachs home again!
Chorus
Of the three that [[Day|day]] were rescued
Two were wounded mighty sore
And one did give his life for Empire
Birchland did rise up no more
So Marchers always stand together
To make a loss of one from three
Join me now in praise and song
For William Archer's bravery!
Chorus
