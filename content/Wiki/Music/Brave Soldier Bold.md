Based on Over the Misty Mountains Cold, as featured in the Hobbit films.
Words by Brian Tollady.
Listen to Brian's rendition [https://youtu.be/C0YrpzFYMMo here]
1st Legion fights on northern mountain cold,
In [[Forest|forest]] deep, marsh or the fold,
Been Wintersun, since time begun,
We march to [[War|war]], brave soldiers bold,
Orcs stand clad in ancient plate and mail,
Foes look on, faces pale,
Those foes we dread, soon slain and dead,
We have but one life, we shall not fail,
We do not [[Fight|fight]] for lord or king,
Or payment made by gold or ring,
When legions speak, [[War|war]] we seek,
As loyal soldiers, we proudly sing,
We would die on northern mountain cold,
In [[Forest|forest]] deep, marsh or the fold,
For Empire’s might, the orcs [[Will|will]] [[Fight|fight]],
And march to war, brave soldiers bold,
Our [[Shamans|shamans]] weave mighty [[Magic|magic]] spells,
Speak to our fallen where darkness dwells,
Across the deep, nay rest nor sleep,
No pain, no sorrow, nay more farewells,
1st legion fight on northern mountain cold,
In forest deep, marsh and the fold,
Been Wintersun, since time begun,
We march to war, brave soldiers bold,
But when I die on northern mountain cold,
In forest deep, marsh or the fold,
I'll pass away, my voice shall stay,
I forged my legend, brave solider bold,
''Optional extra verse''
So we’ll march over the northern mountains cold,
Through forests deep and across the fold,
We’ll drink long and take up song,
And march to war, brave soldiers bold.
