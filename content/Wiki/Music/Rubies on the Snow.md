To the tune of Hana Ava Baba Not. Lyrics JR/[[Music|music]] trad.
RECORDING of this song : [[Media:rubies-on-the-snow.mp3]]
This is thought to be a very old song, which has resurfaced recently. Some bards of Varushka and Navarr have said it appeared in their dreams, but nobody can recall when or where they learnt it...
Thick fell the snows on Navarr
Far we had come, following the battle drum
And their blood fell like [[Rubies on the Snow|rubies on the snow]]
Swift were the blades of the Vard
Hard iron wrought; and like heroes bold we fought 
And the blood fell like [[Rubies on the Snow|rubies on the snow]]
Chorus:
''Snow falls thick in the hollow
''Covering the earth, and war's bloody stain
''Schlachta came here to conquer
''Now here we ever must remain''
Our foes heard an Ushkan Mage call
All was not lost if they'd pay his bloody cost
Where the blood fell like [[Rubies on the Snow|rubies on the snow]].
Deals struck in darkness and cold
Gold he was paid, darkest promises were made
And our blood fell like rubies on the snow
Chorus
Though we fought hard and fought long
Strong was the spell and our foes they used it well
And our blood fell like rubies in the snow
Their victory did not last
Fast they were slain, only to rise up again
Where our blood fell like rubies on the snow
Chorus
Bury my bones where I fell
Tell to my vale all the sorrows of my tale
How our blood fell like rubies on the snow
There lies a heart hard as a stone
Bone guards it still in the Mourning Hollow's chill
Where the blood fell like rubies on the snow
