This can be [[Sung|sung]] before long journeys and at funerals; it is most associated with the practice of sending [[Merrow]] [[Children|children]] to [[Urizen]].
[[The sun shall not rise]] [[Without You|without you]]
Dark are the skies [[Without You|without you]]
I shall have no sleep
All [[Night|night]] my vigil keep
The tide shall not turn without you
No fire shall burn without youÂ 
I'll wait by the shore
Until you come once more
Here I must stay without you
Another [[Day|day]] without you
Silent and alone
While you are [[Gone|gone]]
