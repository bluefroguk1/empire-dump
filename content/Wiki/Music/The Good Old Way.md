May none of us from thee depart
But may our actions always say
We're marching on [[The Good Old Way|the good old Way]]
Chorus x 2
For I have a sweet hope of [[Glory|glory]] in my soul
For I have a sweet hope of [[Glory|glory]] in my soul
For I know I have and I feel I have a sweet hope of [[Glory|glory]] in my soul
Our conflicts here though great they be
Shall not prevent our victory
If we but strive and watch and pray
Like soldiers on [[The Good Old Way|the good old Way]]
Chorus x 2
