Original Song by Jamie Wakefield  (https://soundcloud.com/jamie-wakefield/down-in-the-rugged-glen) 
Chorus – D G D Cadd9 D x2; Verses -  C D Csus2 D x2
Chorus ''(Slow)''
[[Down in the Rugged Glen|Down in the rugged glen]],
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Verse 1
Until the time,
When ways we have [[Trod|trod]] converge into one,
Full of grace,
And gathering where we dance in the sun.
Chorus
[[Down in the Rugged Glen|Down in the rugged glen]],
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Chorus ''(Double time)''
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Verse 1
Until the time,
When ways we have [[Trod|trod]] converge into one,
Full of grace,
And gathering where we dance in the sun.
Chorus
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Verse 2
And when the [[Day|day]] turns dark,
The fires [[Will|will]] burn and brighten the [[Night|night]].
Take my hand,
And dance with me 'til the [[Dawn|dawn]]'s first light.
Chorus
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Coda
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then...
''(Slow)'' …Across the water.
