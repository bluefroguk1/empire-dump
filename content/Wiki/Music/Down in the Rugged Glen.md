Original Song by Jamie Wakefield  (https://soundcloud.com/jamie-wakefield/down-in-the-rugged-glen) 
Chorus – D G D Cadd9 D x2; Verses -  C D Csus2 D x2
Chorus ''(Slow)''
[[Down in the Rugged Glen]],
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Verse 1
Until the time,
When ways we have [[Trod]] converge into one,
FUll of grace,
And gathering where we dance in the sun.
Chorus
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Chorus ''(Double time)''
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Verse 1
Until the time,
When ways we have trod converge into one,
Full of grace,
And gathering where we dance in the sun.
Chorus
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Verse 2
And when the day turns dark,
The fires will burn and brighten the night.
Take my hand,
And dance with me 'til the [[Dawn]]'s first light.
Chorus
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then,
Across the water.
Coda
Down in the rugged glen,
From olden days that are for-gotten
Over the hills and then...
''(Slow)'' …Across the water.
