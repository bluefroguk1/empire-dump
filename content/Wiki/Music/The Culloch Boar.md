Tune by Kathryn Wheeler, lyrics by Kathryn Wheeler and Jude Reid
Sheet [[Music|music]] is available [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/[[The Culloch Boar|The_Culloch_Boar]].pdf here]
High upon the Culloch fell
In [[Forest|forest]] thick and black as hell
Dwells a boar with eyes aglow
To its lair none dares to go
One cold [[Winter|winter]], hard the ground
The boar it comes a-snuffling round
Takes a taste for human meat
Finds the blood and marrow sweet
CHORUS
''Brothers, sisters, beaters all''
''Take up arms and heed the call''
''Evermore my kin shall be''
''Those who hunt the boar with me''
Every [[Night|night]] it kills again
Hungry for the blood of men
Till the keeper tells the town
One of you must hunt it down
Every heart is filled with fear
There's no yeoman dares go near
Till a [[Beater|beater]], bold and brave
Vows he'll go, the town to save
CHORUS
He takes his bow, he takes his spear
He kisses wife and [[Children|children]] dear
He goes his speed and skill to try
To slay the boar or else to die
Now the beaters, keen of eye
Track it to the mountains high
And from inside a night-black cave
Piggy eyes glow bright with rage
CHORUS
Every spear in bright array
Is turned to hold the beast at bay
But with one charge a man lies dead
Its [[Tusks|tusks]] and muzzle drip with red
Our beater lad, with all his might
Steps up now to join the [[Fight|fight]]
Thrusts and parries with his spear
Holds at bay both beast and fear
CHORUS
Now he thrusts the spear again
Hears it roar and shriek in pain
But the boar with bloody glee
Rips his thigh from hip to knee
Now it stares with hungry eyes
Eager to devour its prize
Our beater gathers all his skill
For one last chance the beast to kill
CHORUS
And as it turns to run him down
He plants his spearshaft in the ground
Lowers the point, its charge to meet
And skewers the brute dead at his feet
They carry home the beast they killed
And long the feast, each belly filled
And ne'er was tasted pork so sweet
As that which fed on Marcher meat
CHORUS
 ''(to the tune of the second half of the verse - slowly)''
Granted is the hunting right
To those who slew the boar this night
Culloch's horns shall ever sound
Here upon their hunting ground. 
CHORUS
