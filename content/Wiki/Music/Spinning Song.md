Original song by Jude. 
A pdf of the tune and lyrics can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/9/9b/[[Spinning_Song]].pdf here]. 
Embroider him a favour for to wear around his arm
And tie it in a true love’s knot to keep him safe from harm
Stitch it in the softest silks in colours bright and gay
To bear the memory of your love while he is far away,
Weave yourself a woolen cloth with weave both fine and neat
And wash it by the light of [[Dawn]] in scented water sweet
Make of it a good night-gown and dye it deepest blue
To Warm you in your bed at night when he is far from you
Weave yourself the finest silk for to make into a dress
And stitch it in the colour and the shape that suits you best
Sew in silken roses all around the neck and hem
To wear to bid him welcome when he comes back home again
Weave for him a linen sheet and make it long and wide
Enough to drape across a bed or to clothe a virgin bride
Lay it down upon the earth and wrap it well around
Then tie it in a true love’s knot and lay it in the ground.
