Stand with me, [[Wardens of Varushka]] (x2)
In the winter's snow and hail 
Proud defenders of the Vale

'Cross the empire far and wide
Brothers, sisters side by side

Fight with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2) 
Onward to the war we go 
We will stand against the foe 
Wardens of Varushka 
Join with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2) 
Wolves are howling in the night 
Take up arms and join the fight
