Stand with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2)
In the winter's snow and hail 
Proud defenders of the Vale 
Wardens of Varushka 
Come with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2) 
'Cross [[The Empire]] far and wide
Brothers, sisters side by side 
Wardens of Varushka 
[[Fight]] with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2) 
Onward to the [[War]] we go 
We will stand against the foe 
Wardens of Varushka 
Join with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2) 
Wolves are howling in the night 
Take up arms and join the fight 
Wardens of Varushka

Sing with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2)
Drumbeat strong and voices loud
Heads held high and never bowed
Wardens of Varushka
Drink with me, Wardens of Varushka (x2)
Fire to keep the dark at bay
Mead to drink til break of day
Wardens of Varushka
