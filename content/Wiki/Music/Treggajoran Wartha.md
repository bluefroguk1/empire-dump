Down in the town of [[Treggajoran Wartha]]
Cumes on Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan
Johnny Bucca lived Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan
Lived with his lovely daughter
Two merry geeks came asking to court her
Cumes on Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan
Two merry geeks Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan

Wined her and dined her on ale and porter
Cumes on Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan
Wined her and dined Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan
Her on ale and porter
Jenny took turns walking out along the water
Cumes on Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan

Buy a bigger ring each one he thought he ought to

Gathering up the rings Jenny gave no quarter

Down in the town of Treggajoran Wartha
Cumes on Jenny Jo Jenny Jinny Jan
