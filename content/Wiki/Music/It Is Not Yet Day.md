[[Chords]]: Verse & Chorus - D5 Am G; Bridge - Dm F, Dm F G.
Verse 1
I came by a house last [[Night|night]]
told the woman I am staying
said to her:"The moon is bright,
and my fiddles tuned for playing"
Chorus
Tell me that the night is long
Tell me that the moon is glowing
Fill my glass I'll sing a song
And [[Will|will]] start the [[Music|music]] flowing
Verse 2
Never mind the rising light
There's no sign of [[Day|day]] or dawning
In my heart it's still the night
And we'll stay here till the morning
Chorus
Verse 3
It's not day nor yet awhile
I can see the starlight shining
In my heart it's still the night
And we'll stay here till the morning
Bridge
Fill the glasses one more time
And never heed the empty bottle
Turn the water into wine
And turn the party up full throttle
Verse 4
Don't go out into the cold
Where the wind and rain are blowing
For the fire is flaming gold
And in here the [[Music|music]]'s flowing
Chorus
Verse 5
Tell me that the night is long
Tell me that the moon is gleaming
Fill my glass, I’ll sing a song 
And we'll keep the [[Music|music]] [[Streaming|streaming]] [Hold G]
Until all the songs are [[Sung|sung]]
Chorus
Coda
Tell me that the night is long
Tell me that the moon is glowing
Fill my glass I'll sing a song
And we'll start the [[Music|music]]...
Start the [[Music|music]]...
Start the music flowing!
