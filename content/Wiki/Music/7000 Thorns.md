-------------------
[[7000 Thorns]]
By Idwyn Splitroot
Drum beat “Kill the [[Jotun]]”
[[Liathaven]] (repeated throughout)
Call of Winter [[Winter magic]], The Dead will rise
Slaughtering the Jotun, a voiceless demise
We will [[Fight]] (No mercy)
Through the night (No mercy)
We will fight (No mercy)
Through the night
7000 Thorns of the [[Navarr]]
Rip through the night
Leave no scars
Leave your blood or leave no mark
We are the reason
You fear the dark
Liathaven x2 (and throughout)
Poorly guarded Steading
The trap was laid
Slaughtering the Joutn
Be afraid
