[[7000 Thorns]]
By Idwyn Splitroot
Drum beat “Kill the [[Jotun]]”
[[Liathaven]] (repeated throughout)
Call of [[Winter magic|Winter Magic]], The Dead [[Will|will]] rise
Slaughtering the [[Jotun]], a voiceless demise
We [[Will|will]] [[Fight|fight]] (No mercy)
Through the [[Night|night]] (No mercy)
We will [[Fight|fight]] (No mercy)
Through the night
[[7000 Thorns]] of the [[Navarr]]
Rip through the night
Leave no scars
Leave your blood or leave no mark
We are the reason
You fear the dark
[[Liathaven]] x2 (and throughout)
Poorly guarded [[Steading|steading]]
The trap was laid
Slaughtering the Joutn
Be afraid
