Original song " Byla Cesta" trad. Moravian. Words by Daisy.
RECORDING of this song : Media:hearth-and-home.mp3
Springtime blossom scents the air with flowers
Summer sunlight brings long evening hours
Chorus:
O [[Varushka]]! O Varushka, never more I'll roam
In Varushka, in Varushka lies my [[Hearth and Home]]
Autumn Forests ring with axe and song
Winter's beauty only for the strong
Chorus
In the night time, parting lovers weaving
Only braids and never tears when leaving
Chorus
Weeks go by, another year is turning
Turning homeWard where my heart is yearning
Chorus
