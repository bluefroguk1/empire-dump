Original song " Byla Cesta" trad. Moravian. Words by Daisy.
RECORDING of this song : [[Media:hearth-and-home.mp3]]
Springtime blossom scents the air with flowers
Summer sunlight brings long evening hours
Chorus:
O Varushka! O Varushka, never more I'll roam
In Varushka, in Varushka lies my [[Hearth and Home|hearth and home]]
Autumn forests ring with axe and song
Winter's beauty only for the strong
Chorus
In the night time, parting lovers weaving
Only [[Varushka Culture and Customs#Parting|braids]] and never tears when leaving
Chorus
Weeks go by, another year is turning
Turning homeward where my heart is yearning
Chorus
