Original song " Byla Cesta" trad. Moravian. Words by Daisy.
RECORDING of this song : Media:hearth-and-home.mp3
Springtime blossom scents the air with flowers
[[Summer]] sunlight brings long evening hours
Chorus:
O [[Varushka]]! O [[Varushka]], never more I'll roam
In [[Varushka]], in [[Varushka]] lies my [[Hearth and Home|hearth and home]]
[[Autumn]] forests ring with axe and song
[[Winter]]'s beauty only for the strong
Chorus
In the [[Night|night]] time, parting lovers weaving
Only braids and never tears when leaving
Chorus
Weeks go by, another year is turning
Turning homeward where my heart is yearning
Chorus
