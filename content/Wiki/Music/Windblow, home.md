Song by Gerwyn Walters  (link to come) 
Chorus
Wind blow hot. Wind blow cold.
From Te-run-ael, come warriors bold, 
To set their feet, on brambled path.
Bloody feet! The Vallorn's Wrath.
Verse 1
Come Navarr young. Come Navarr old.
Show the courage, that you hold.
Barb-ed spear, and bow run free,
And walk the path that, will set us free
Chorus
'
Verse 2
Come Nav-ar-ri. Bare your pride,
Along the Trod both, long and wide.
Bare you brands, to the green,
So our oaths there, can be seen.
Chorus
Verse 3
Come Way-far-ers, bare you load,
Onward, always, down the road.
Greet your friends,  along the way.
Bring your oath-sworn, to the fray.
Chorus
Verse 4
Come now branded, hark to me.
Guide our path through, the cursed trees.
Bring us home, where our ancient rest.
Put our loyalty, to the test.
Chorus
Verse 4
Come now blood-ed, hooded vate.
Ward your sisters. Ward your mate.
Take your place, with-in the dance.
Let the blood flow, on the manse.
Chorus
Verse 5
Come now Thorns, with blades a-drawn.
Stand you ready. Stand you tall.
With sharp eyes you, shield the stride.
Sharpen daggers, on Vallorn hide.
Chorus
Verse 6
Come Navarri. Come the Nine.
Where we walk, we walk in time.
Our empire will, never fall.
We swear this oath, to fight for all.
Coda
Wind blow hot. Wind blow cold.
To Te-run-ael, come warriors bold.
Where we walk, and where we bleed,
We will full-fil,  Navarr's creed
Wind blow hot. Wind blow cold.
To Te-run-ael, Come warriors bold,
On bloody feet, both young and old.
Human triumph, are foretold.
