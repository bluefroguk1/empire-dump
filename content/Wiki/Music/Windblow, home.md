Song by Gerwyn Walters  (link to come) 
Chorus
Wind blow hot. Wind blow cold.
From Te-run-ael, come Warriors bold, 
To set their feet, on brambled path.
Bloody feet! [[The Vallorn]]'s Wrath.
Verse 1
Come [[Navarr]] young. Come Navarr old.
Show the [[Courage]], that you hold.
Barb-ed spear, and bow run free,
And walk the path that, will set us free
Chorus
'
Verse 2
Come Nav-ar-ri. Bare your [[Pride]],
Along the [[Trod]] both, long and wide.
Bare you brands, to the green,
So our oaths there, can be seen.
Chorus
Verse 3
Come Way-far-ers, bare you load,
Onward, always, down the road.
Greet your friends,  along [[The Way]].
Bring your oath-sworn, to the fray.
Chorus
Verse 4
Come now branded, hark to me.
Guide our path through, the Cursed trees.
Bring us home, where our ancient rest.
Put our [[Loyalty]], to the test.
Chorus
Verse 4
Come now blood-ed, hooded vate.
Ward your sisters. Ward your mate.
Take your place, with-in the dance.
Let the blood flow, on the manse.
Chorus
Verse 5
Come now Thorns, with blades a-drawn.
Stand you ready. Stand you tall.
With sharp eyes you, shield the stride.
Sharpen daggers, on [[Vallorn]] hide.
Chorus
Verse 6
Come Navarri. Come the Nine.
Where we walk, we walk in time.
Our empire will, never fall.
We swear this oath, to [[Fight]] for all.
Coda
Wind blow hot. Wind blow cold.
To Te-run-ael, come warriors bold.
Where we walk, and where we bleed,
We will fUll-fil,  Navarr's creed
Wind blow hot. Wind blow cold.
To Te-run-ael, Come warriors bold,
On bloody feet, both young and old.
Human triumph, are foretold.
