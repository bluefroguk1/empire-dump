[[Marching to Victory]]
by the Gremani [[Family]]
Chorus:
Come join with me in song, to [[War]] we march along
Fighting for fame and treasure, leaving our life of leisure
The buckler and [[The Blade]], the weapons of our trade
War is the greatest pleasure
Marching to Victory!
Thieves may rob you of your treasures golden
Fame's a coin that never can be stolen
Chorus:
Place your lover's ring upon your finger
And look back when at the gate you linger
Chorus:
Those at home will Keep the Fires [[Keep the Fires Burning]]
All to welcome us on our returning
Chorus:
If you find me with the dead and dying
Kiss my lips and leave me where I'm lying
Chorus:
Even death can't rob us of our [[Glory]]
Our deeds will live on in song and story
Chorus:
Dressed for war, Don Cesare's a charmer
All the bravos love a man in armour
Chorus:
