[[Marching to Victory]]
by the Gremani [[Family]]
Chorus:
Come join with me in song, to [[War|war]] we march along
Fighting for fame and treasure, leaving our life of leisure
The buckler and [[The Blade|the blade]], the weapons of our trade
[[War]] is the greatest pleasure
[[Marching to Victory]]!
Thieves may rob you of your treasures golden
Fame's a coin that never can be stolen
Chorus:
Place your lover's ring upon your finger
And look back when at the [[Gate|gate]] you linger
Chorus:
Those at home [[Will|will]] [[Keep the Fires Burning|keep the fires burning]]
All to welcome us on our returning
Chorus:
If you find me with the dead and dying
Kiss my lips and leave me where I'm lying
Chorus:
Even death can't rob us of our [[Glory|glory]]
Our deeds [[Will|will]] live on in song and story
Chorus:
Dressed for war, Don Cesare's a charmer
All the [[Bravos|bravos]] love a man in armour
Chorus:
