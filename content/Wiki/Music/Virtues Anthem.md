RECORDING of this song: Media:virtues-anthem.mp3
O come o come ye seven virtues bright
And lead this soul from darkness into light
Let [[Courage]] be my armour and my shield
With virtue as my guide I shall not yield
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
O let my spirit hear [[Ambition]]'s call
To strive and rise and never fear to fall
Let flames of holy fervour fill my soul
I shall not cease until I reach my goal
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
I pray that every day my [[Wisdom]] grow
That I in turn may teach on what I know
To know the tRuths of all the world I yearn-
Till my last breath I shall not cease to learn
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
Oh holy virtue grant that I be proud 
To own my sins and speak my virtues loud
No falsehoods vile, false modesty or shame
Shall tarnish the bright [[Glory]] of my name
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
All ills I will ensure for duty's sake
A valiant heart may cease but never break
To kinsman, to lover, and to friend
My [[Loyalty]] shall be without an end 
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
With [[Vigilance]] I strive that I perceive
Those liars who dissemble and deceive
May sinners fear my name across the land
May traitors perish weeping at my hand
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
When hard I work with hand and heart and mind
[[Prosperity]] shall follow close behind
I shall make use of every throne I earn
That other men shall Prosperous be in turn
''O come o come ye seven virtues bright''
''And lead this soul from darkness into light''
