Lyrics by Amelia Crowley, [[Music]] by Jude Reid.
A pdf of the lyrics and tune can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/7/78/The_Moon%27s_Only_Daughter.pdf here]. 
William of [[Astolat]] walking by night
Was struck by a beacon of pEarl grey light
Fashioned of starfire, lovely and chill
The moon's only daughter came over the hill
She walked like a mist-wraith with never a sound
As she drifted and dreamed high above the dark ground
And William knew coming to with a start
That the moon's only daughter had stolen his heart
He trembled and shook till he hardly could stand
Then he stumbled before her with hat in his hand
But before he could utter what plainly he showed
The moon's only daughter passed on down the road
He followed down hillsides, he followed on plain
He followed through Forests and fields thick with grain
He followed her over the silvery moor
Till he saw her go in at her mother's white door
He waited without, for her dared not go in
Dared not touch [[The Door]], for he feared 'twas a sin
That to touch the moon's whiteness would damn him for sure
So he stood there, in silence, a step from the door
William of Astolat walks by the hill
And as he goes dreaming true lovers fall still
For [[Dawn]] found him walking, all dew-drenched and dazed
And his heart will keep aching for all of his days.
