Words and tune by Claire Sheridan. [https://soundcloud.com/herecosyouare-1/18-rings tune]
Comical song, in the style of popular tavern songs, by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach.
[[18 Rings|18 rings]], [[18 Rings|18 rings]],
All I've got of all I had 
Is [[18 Rings|18 rings]].
Oh when I ran a [[Business|business]],
I ate and drank full well,
But that was all in [[Mournwold]]
Now there’s nothing left to sell.
(Chorus)
I used to harvest [[Weirwood]],
And hoped to gain much wealth,
But that got sacked by [[Jotun]]
Which was not good for my health.
(Chorus)
Oh then I had a navy,
I’d trade goods by the score,
But they were sacked by [[Grendel]]
So I don’t trade anymore.
(Chorus)
I used to harvest mana
Which sparkled in the [[Night|night]],
But nothing could restore them
Once they’d perished in a blight.
(Chorus)
Oh once I ran a unit,
They brought my much to trade,
But then they went to [[Skarsind]]-
''(Here raise a toast to the fallen)''
(Chorus)
Oh once I had a [[Sinecure|sinecure]]
And promised not to shirk
But now the Civil Service say
They’ve lost my paperwork
(Chorus)
I tried my hand at preaching,
And dabbled with [[Liao|liao]],
But both were taken by [[Thule]] thugs -
They’re no use to me now.
(Chorus)
High upon a mountain
I grew [[Herbs|herbs]] by the ton,
But the snow that came in [[Winter|winter]]
Went and shrivelled every one.
(Chorus)
So underground I headed
To [[Mine|mine]] for metals rare,
Since bandits hit my caravan
I’ve nothing left to spare.
(Chorus and so on)
''Infinitely open to reinterpretation and updating with current [[Events|events]].''
