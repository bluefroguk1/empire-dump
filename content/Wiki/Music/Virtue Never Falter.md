Lyrics by Andre Tcherepnine. The tune is Riu Riu Chiu [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzGQU5VMPdI youtube version]
Here is a guide for the tune, but please do listen to the recording as well. 
The triangles denote places where the tune groups three quavers (and gives it the bounce that you hear on the recording). The crotchets with x heads are three clapped beats.

    Chorus:
    See the Way before you
    Your path never alter
    Be you ever loyal
    [[Virtue Never Falter|Virtue never falter]] (repeat last 2 lines)
    In the Revelation was the Way discovered
    By the Scions' work was the Labyrinth uncovered
    From the Distant Shores came the proof of our birthright
    Signs of Seven Virtues seen as clear as daylight
    Chorus
    On the Winds of Virtue was this finding carried
    Brought to all the people of the Nations varied
    When the Empress rose so did the Way of Virtue
    Founded was the Synod ever faithful and true
    Chorus
    Heed the Pride of ages your soul will be commended
    Vigilance and Courage will keep you well defended
    Prosperous and Wise is the way that's never fallow
    Loyal and Ambitious the soul that's ever hallowed
    Chorus
