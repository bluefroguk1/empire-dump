    Chorus:
    See [[The Way|the Way]] before you
    Your path never alter
    Be you ever loyal
    [[Virtue Never Falter|Virtue never falter]] (repeat last 2 lines)
    In the Revelation was [[The Way|the Way]] discovered
    By the Scions' work was the Labyrinth uncovered
    From the Distant Shores came the proof of our birthright
    Signs of Seven Virtues seen as clear as daylight
    Chorus
    On the Winds of Virtue was this finding carried
    Brought to all the people of [[The Nations|the Nations]] varied
    When [[The Empress|the Empress]] rose so did the Way of Virtue
    Founded was [[The Synod|the Synod]] ever faithful and true
    Chorus
    Heed the [[Pride]] of ages your soul [[Will|will]] be commended
    [[Vigilance]] and [[Courage]] [[Will|will]] keep you well defended
    Prosperous and Wise is the way that's never fallow
    Loyal and Ambitious the soul that's ever hallowed
    Chorus
