Original tune Akk Fader. Very quiet recording of original [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUlBT_VWSeI&list=PL9STuhamGVYyzHKJQcl16ka8GlF8glg77&index=1 here].
I arm myself with sword and shield
To take the battlefield
And daily armed with faith I go
To face a subtler foe
An empire pure and wholeÂ 
Must ever be our goal
''O let me ever vigilant stand''
''Defending faith and land''
False doctrines and deceitful words
Across the lands are heard
And all our sacrifice has bought
In the end shall be for nought,
If malcontents and fools
And raised on high to rule
''O let me ever vigilant stand''
''Defending faith and land.''
These words shall ever be our charge
Upon our souls writ large
The Empire is our destiny
Its guards and lords are we
For should we ever fail
The darkness shall prevail
''O let me ever vigilant stand''
''Defending faith and land''
