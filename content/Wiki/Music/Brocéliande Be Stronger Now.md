Verse 1  ''- Am D Am, Am D F, Am D Am x2''
Broceliande, be stronger now
The Winds of Change have come for thee
To wander hence but still return
From't' darkest watches e'er I see
Chorus ''(continues through verses) – Am''
The walkers came from the darkest watches. The walkers came from the darkest watches.
Verse 1 ''(repeated) - Am D Am, Am D F, Am D Am x2''
Broceliande, be stronger now
The Winds of Change have come for thee
To wander hence but still return
From't' darkest watches e'er I see
Verse 2  ''- Am G Am, Am G F, Am G Am x2''
Broceliande, be stronger now
Although the wilds has come for thee
I will return to wander hence
With tears of salt to fill the sea.
Bridge  ''- F, Dm C''
I see
I see
Chorus ''(continues through verse) - Am''
The walkers came from the darkest watches. The walkers came from the darkest watches. 
The walkers came from the darkest watches. The walkers came from the darkest watches.
Verse 3 ''-  Am D Am x2, Am G Am x2''
Through weary days that turn to night
Broceliande, I'll wait for thee
Though I may be asleep in dust
My spirit dances endlessly
Bridge  ''- F, Dm C''
My spirit
My spirit
Chorus ''– Am F x2, Am''
The walkers came from the darkest watches. The walkers came from the darkest watches.
The walkers came from the darkest watches. The walkers came from the darkest watches. 
The walkers came from the darkest watches. The walkers came from the darkest watches.
