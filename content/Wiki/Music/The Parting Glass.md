Of all the money e'er I had,
I spent it [[In good company]].
And all the harm e'er I've done,
Alas! it was to none but me.
And all I've done for want of wit
To mem'ry now I can't recall
So fill to me [[The Parting Glass]]
Good night and joy be with you all.
''Chorus: (Some Versions Omit)''
So fill to me the parting glass
And drink a Health whate'er befalls
Then gently rise and softly call
"Good night and joy be to you all"
Oh, all the comrades e'er I had,
They're sorry for my going away,
And all the sweethearts e'er I had,
They'd wish me one more day to stay,
But since it falls unto my lot,
That I should rise and you should not,
I gently rise and softly call,
Good night and joy be with you all.
If I had money enough to spend,
And leisure time to sit awhile,
There is a fair maid in this town,
That sorely has my heart beguiled.
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips,
I own she has my heart in thrall,
Then fill to me the parting glass,
Good night and joy be with you all.
