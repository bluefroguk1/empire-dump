Original [[Music]] & Lyrics by Anna Clifford Tait and Stephanie Heath
RECORDING of this song : [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/[[Music|music]]/steph/HurryHunter.mp3 Hurry Hunter]
Hunter steps through shadows swiftly
Creeping, creeping carefully
Following the signs that lead him
Signs of promise, signs of life
''Chorus:''
''[[Hurry, Hunter|Hurry, hunter]], darkness chases''
''Don't let nightfall catch you out''
''Once the sun sets, your role changes''
''Blood on snow, you are the prey''
Up ahead a movement flashes
Hunter freezes, senses strain
There she is - the bow swings ready,
Arrow nocks to bring her down.
''Chorus''
Still the moment, silence rings out
Arrow looses, flying fast
At the last, the gentle doe hears
Shivers, bucks and off she goes.
''Chorus''
Hunter runs, a trail of crimson
Stains the snow, the shot was true
But the doe is fleeting, fleeing
Chase is on to win the prize.
''Chorus''
Blood on snow the trail grows thicker
Weaker, slower, still she runs
Hunter thinks of crying [[Children|children]]
Follows on as darkness falls.
''Chorus''
Silver body lies before him
Crumpled on the [[Forest|forest]] floor
Hunter sees, then come the growlings
Children they are crying still.
