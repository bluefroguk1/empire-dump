There are various versions of this song that are suitable for several nations if tweaked to fit that nation's style.
---------
[[Marches]]/[[Dawn]]/[[League]]/[[Highguard]] version (does not have to be in a Scottish dialect!)
[http://www.amazon.co.uk/3-Ravens/dp/B004AUSK62/ listen/buy Malinky's version here]
Three ravens sat upon a tree
''Hey doun hey derrie [[Day|day]]''
Three ravens sat upon a tree
''Hey doun''
Three ravens sat upon a tree
And they were black as black could be
''And sing la do an la do a day''
The middle ane said tae his mate
"Oh where shall we our dinner get?"
"Well, it's doun intae yon grass green field
There lies a knight that's newly killed"
And his [[Horse|horse]] is standing at his side
And thinks he might get up and ride
And his hounds are lying at his feet
And they lick his wounds sae sore and deep
There came a lady full of woe
As big wi' child as she could go
And she's stretched hersel' doon at his side
And for the love of him she's died
[[Wintermark]]/[[Navarr]]/[[Varushka]] version
