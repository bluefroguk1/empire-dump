Words and tune by Claire Sheridan.
Written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach in Proud memory of Lucia Cascade. 
Part I
Light up the Spires,
Light up the night,
Come see the starsâ€™
Silver light;
Reach out your fingers,
Reach out your voice,
Mages of [[Music]],
Rejoice. 
Part II
Cascade of stars
Silver-blue glow:
Strike, strum, call, chant
Let it flow.
Part III
Light up the Spires,
Light up the night,
Come see the starlight;
Reach out your fingers,
Reach out your voice,
Mages of music rejoice.
