[[The sun shall not rise]] [[Without You|without you]]
Dark are the skies [[Without You|without you]]
I shall have no sleep
All night my vigil keep
The tide shall not turn [[Without You|without you]]
No fire shall burn without you
I'll wait by the shore
Until you come once more
Here I must stay without you
Another day without you
Silent and alone
While you are [[Gone|gone]]
