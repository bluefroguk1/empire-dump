[[The sun shall not rise]] [[Without You]]
Dark are the skies without you
I shall have no sleep
All night my vigil keep
The tide shall not turn without you
No fire shall burn without you
I'll wait by the shore
Until you come once more
Here I must stay without you
Another day Without You
Silent and alone
While you are gone
