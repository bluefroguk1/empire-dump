* [https://soundcloud.com/christopher-clarke-580791164/south-catazar-[[Barbarian|barbarian]]-[[Music|music]]-for-[[Grendel|grendel]] [[South Catazar]] on SoundCloud], [[Sung|sung]] by Chris Clarke, with Mark Kuggeleijn, Ed, and Lilly,
In [[South Catazar]] I was born, 
Heave away, haul away!
In [[South Catazar]], on the 'shore
We're bound for [[South Catazar]]!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing
We're bound for [[South Catazar]]!
As I walked out one morning fair
Heave away, haul away!
'Twas there I met miss Bowdikkeh
We're bound for South Catazar!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing
We're bound for South Catazar!
I shook her up, I shook her down
Heave away, haul away!
I shook her 'round and 'round the town
We're bound for South Catazar!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing
We're bound for South Catazar!
I run her all [[Night|night]] and I run her all [[Day|day]]
Heave away, haul away!
And I run until we sailed away
We're bound for South Catazar!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing
We're bound for South Catazar!
There's just one thing that grieves my mind
Heave away, haul away!
It's leaving Taraneh behind
We're bound for South Catazar!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing
We're bound for South Catazar!
And as we wallop 'round the 'shore
Heave away, haul away!
You all [[Will|will]] wish you'd never been born
We're bound for South Catazar!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing
We're bound for South Catazar!
The broken shore's my native land
Heave away, haul away!
Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand
We're bound for South Catazar!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing
We're bound for South Catazar!
I wish I was on the broken strand
Heave away, haul away
With a bottle of whiskey in my hand
We're bound for South Catazar!
Haul away you rolling kings,
Heave away, haul away!
Haul away, now hear me sing,
We're bound for South Catazar!
