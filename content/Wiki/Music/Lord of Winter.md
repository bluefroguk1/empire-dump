Ice on the bitter earth
Black frost in the meadow
Dark trees in their [[Winter|winter]] death
Amid sharp, piercing snow
I don't know what he wants
I can't see what he's asking
But I am forever bound
To the song that he brings
Chorus: I [[Will|will]] sing for the winter's dream
I [[Will|will]] sing for the [[Night|night]]
I [[Will|will]] sing for the [[Summer|summer]] [[Gone|gone]]
I [[Will|will]] sing for the light
I look in his ancient eyes
And I see my desires
There, 'neath my shadowed heart
Grows a dark, stirring fire
Clutched in his frozen arms
With his song in my head
A blanket of sparkling snow
Dwells my everlasting bed
Chorus
The [[Music|music]] of boundless ice
Which has called since my birth
I have given my only love
To the dark, frozen earth
