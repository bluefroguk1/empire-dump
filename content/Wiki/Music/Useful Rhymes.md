These rhymes are spoken all over the Empire and often nations have their own versions. Children sometimes use these chants in games or when picking (like Eeenie Meenie Minie Mo).
### Virtue Rhymes
Ambition, Prosperity, Loyalty, Pride - Empire strong and the foeman outside
Courage and Wisdom, and Vigilance true - Empire's future depends upon you
Pride - play each game as it ought to be played
Prosperity - share the good things you have made
Wisdom - know when you don't know and should ask
Courage to act and not flinch from the task
Loyalty during both good times and bad
Ambition to make this the best life you've had
Vigilance always, and seeing things true
Empire's future depends upon you.
Pride - know the great stuff your nation has done.
Prosperity - help everybody have fun
Wisdom - your words should be clever, but brief
Courage - strong heart kicks an orc inna teef.
Loyalty - keep to your family strong
Ambition - keep going, you'll never go wrong.
Vigilance - keep your friends faithful and true.
Empire's future depends upon you.
### Nation Rhymes
Here is Varuskha, who keep to the light,
Here's the Navarri - they're good in fight
Here's Urizen who are magic and clever
Here's Wintermark who are Loyal forever.
Here are the Marches who toil in the sun.
Here is the League who can get the job done.
Here are the Freeborn who come from Brass Coast
Here are the Orcs who will eat you on toast,
Here are the Highborn who keep to the faith,
Here are the Dawnish who who test you to death!
### Physick Rhymes
Blue Mazzarine to save a limb
Grey Bladeroot stems a weakness dim
Red Roseweald poison's power breaks
True Vervain body's healing wakes
Though Marrowort takes soldiers' pain
At battle's end they'll fall again
