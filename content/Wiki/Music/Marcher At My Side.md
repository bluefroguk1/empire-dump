An often sung variant of the tune is slightly different - sheet music available [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/A%20Marcher%20At%20My%20Side.pdf here]
1. Well once I was a Farmer 
Out in the sun and rain 
I sowed the fields in springtime 
And reaped the autumn grain 
But I've put down my ploughing, 
Took my billhook in my hand 
And joined that gallant army 
That's the [[Pride]] of [[Bregasland]] 
Chorus: 
You can talk about your [[Highguard]] 
And your Freeborn Privateers 
Your [[Wintermark]] militia 
And your Dawnish Volunteers 
Or any other army, 
The glorious Empire wide 
For I'd sooner be a Strong Reed, 
With a [[Marcher At My Side]]. 
2.Well I was a musician 
Across the land I'd play 
From the taverns down in Wayford 
To the golden fields of Hay 
But now I am a drummer 
And I've laid my harp aside 
And now I march to battle 
Proudly at the [[Bounders]]' side 
Chorus 
(ending with "For I'd sooner be a 
Bounder, with a Marcher at my side") 
3.Well I was once a Friar 
A pilgrim on [[The Way]] 
My nights were spent in prayer 
And I tended herbs by day 
But I've left the [[Monastery]] 
And I'm armed with mace and shield 
And now I preach to Tom Drake's army 
On [[The Battlefield]] 
Chorus 
(ending with "For I'd sooner be in 
Tom Drake's, with a Marcher at my side") 
4.Once I was a trapper 
CUlling [[Vermin]] on the [[Farm]] 
But I yearn to use my bow [[Skills]] 
To do a greater harm 
So now I've left the copses 
Where the fox and deer abide 
To go to cull the enemy, 
The Beaters at my side 
Chorus 
(ending with "For I'd sooner be a 
Beater, with a Marcher at my side") 
5.I bargain with Eternals, 
I circle and recite 
To bring the crops to fruitfulness 
[[Heal]] blemish and the blight 
And now, intoning in the fray 
Unarmed, no plate, no chain 
This [[Upwold]] Keeper strives to keep 
His fellow Bounders sane 
Chorus 
(ending with "For I'd sooner be a 
Bounder, with a Marcher at my side") 
6.The sickle that scythed through the grain 
Now reaps a grimmer yield 
And the billhook that repaired the hedge 
Lays waste upon the field 
The [[Strong Reeds]] stand unbowed, unbent 
Against the coming storm 
And now we thresh right through them 
Like a flail through the corn 
Chorus 
(ending with "For I'd sooner be a 
Strong Reed, with a Marcher At My Side") 
7.Where the land once echoed 
With hammer striking steel 
The rhythm of the lathe and loom, 
The weapon-maker's zeal 
The gathering troops now gird their loins 
With the fruits of sweat and blood: 
The [[Gambeson]], the mail shirt, 
The hauberk and the hood 
Chorus 
(ending with "For I'd sooner be a 
Marcher, with my fellows at my side")
