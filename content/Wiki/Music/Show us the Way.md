Lyrics by Tiana i Zaydan i Riqueza 
Beneath the Asavean Sun, I call out to the free
The heroes of the Empire, will you send your aid to me
We will rise up, like the orcs of old and overthrow our masters
But soon we saw our uprising would lead us to disaster
Beneath the Asavean sun, don’t look away, don’t look away
Heroes of the Empire Come, will you [[Show us the Way|show us the Way]]?
Beneath the Asavean sun, some came to join our cause
The heroes of the Empire came, they landed on our shores
The sailors came to lift us free, but the soldiers came to chain us
They came back with our slave-masters to beat us and restrain us
Beneath the Asavean sun, don’t look away, don’t look away
Heroes of the Empire Come, will you [[Show us the Way|show us the Way]]?
Beneath the Asavean sun, our slavery remains
The heroes of the Empire, they returned me to my chains
I cry out, who will help us, to old Marracoss we flee
So, heroes of the Empire, will you come and fight for me?
Beneath the Asavean sun, don’t look away, don’t look away
Heroes of the Empire Come, will you [[Show us the Way|show us the Way]]?
