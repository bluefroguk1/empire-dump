--------------------------
Children playing in the snow 
Further out than they should go,
Saw a stranger walking near –
Never stopped to think or fear.
CHORUS
Hair like snow, eyes that gleam,
Things aren’t always what they seem.
Teeth too long, hands too thin –
Always look [[Beneath the Skin|beneath the skin]]!
Greetings children, the woman said,
It’s so cold, I’m chilled near dead,
Where’s your camp and family, too?
Won’t you take me home with you?
CHORUS
Long white hair and eyes like ice,
She spoke so fair she seemed so nice;
Foolish children did not ask,
Why she set them such a task.
CHORUS
They did not wait to find a guard,
They led her straight to their own yard.
They did not think to ask their kin,
They brought her home and let her in.
CHORUS
And when she was well hid inside,
Then she cast off her human hide.
Her fangs grew long, her claws sprang free –
A hungry fierce snow beast was she!
CHORUS
And all that night through every tent
She stalked and slaughtered as she went.
When the sun raised up his head,
Half of all that tribe lay dead.
CHORUS
For pretty words and pretty whiles
And pretty looks and pretty smiles –
Those folks where slain and scattered all,
Because they let their caution fall.
Hair like snow, eyes that gleam,
Things aren’t always what they seem.
Teeth too long, hands too thin –
Always look [[Beneath the Skin|beneath the skin]]!
Always look [[Beneath the Skin|beneath the skin]]!
