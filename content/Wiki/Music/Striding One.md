Original Song: Wolfen One by Alexander James Adams, heir to Heather Alexander (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=houzbrRvfhU)
New lyrics by Alexander Bolingbroke
[[Striding One|Striding one]], You are my midday moon and I your midnight sun
[[Striding]] one, Our journey's at an end but life has just begun
When first we met, I thought that what I felt could not be true
But through the sharing of our hearts there now is one where there was two
Left to right, the meeting of the darkened [[Day|day]] and dawning [[Night|night]]
Drum to tune, the joining of the shining sun and silver moon
I knew the risk I took when down beside you I had laid
And lo, the breath of two new lives was well [[Worth|worth]] the price I paid
[[Striding One|Striding one]], come dance with me and gaze back at which we have done
[[Striding]] one, we've sown the threads by which the future shall be spun
Striding one, you are my midday moon and I, your midnight sun
Striding one...
