A song written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach after the first skirmish to the [[Black Plateau]], [[Spiral]], in YE377.
Through the [[Gate|gate]] and here we go,
Up, up to the [[Black Plateau]],
With [[Courage|courage]] and [[Pride|pride]] to face the foe,
High up on the Black Plateau.
There is a place in [[Urizen]] fair,
Up, up to the Black Plateau,
Where whispering voices fill the air,
Those who tread should tread with care,
Don’t trust what you hear on the air,
High up on the Black Plateau.
Gathered people, wild and cruel,
Up, up on the Black Plateau,
They’ll laugh in your face as they run you through,
High up on the Black Plateau.
There is a place in [[Urizen]] bold,
Up, up on the Black Plateau,
Where wild men worship something old,
The sight of it [[Will|will]] leave you cold,
They’ll take your blood to feed its soul,
High up on the Black Plateau.
Blades of [[Venom|venom]], blades of glass,
Up, up to the Black Plateau,
[[Will]] stop you if you try to pass,
High up on the Black Plateau.
There is a place in Urizen high, 
Up, up to the Black Plateau,
Where they’ve got blades to warp your mind, 
An anger unknown to our kind,
Don’t lash out or get left behind,
High up on the Black Plateau. 
Through the gate and here we go,
Up, up to the Black Plateau,
With [[Courage|courage]] and [[Pride|pride]] to face the foe,
High up on the Black Plateau.
