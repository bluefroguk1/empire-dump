--------------------------
From my father’s hold with iron cold
I swore I’d not return
‘Til I’d felt the breath and seen the death
Of [[The Beast of Volgadurn|the beast of Volgadurn]]
Though furs I lacked, its spoor I tracked
Through snowfields cold and stern
To the child it took by the blood-stained brook
Oh, [[The Beast of Volgadurn|the beast of Volgadurn]]
‘Twas the high-woods trail that I tried to scale
Where first it sought to turn
In my pursuit I stopped to shoot
At the beast of Volgadurn
The arrow flew, the shot was true
Hot blood fell like to burn
It whined and fled, and crimson bled
Straight back to Volgadurn
To my father’s hold with iron cold
I rushed with grave concern
I found him dead from my arrow-head
The Beast of Volgadurn
When [[Winter]]’s chills come scour these hills
My blood begins to churn
For my fur is won, my father’s son
Is the Beast of Volgadurn…
