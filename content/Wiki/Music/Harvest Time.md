[[Harvest Time]]
The corn stands tall and ready
We'll reap the grain and sow again
The seeds of what will be
You marched with Britta's army
To [[Fight]] for [[Loyalty]]
And while you're away, it's here I'll stay
Till you come back to me
Darkness falls
And all the land lies dreaming
The stars are bright and shine tonight
They burn as bright as day
They'll guide you on till morning
Until the east is gray
And across the land the dolmens stand
Like milestones on your way
Seasons turn
And autumn's changed to winter 
And in the sky the ravens fly 
Above the frozen fen
We'll stand up on the hillside
And light the wicker men
And like beacons bright they'll burn tonight
To guide you home again
