Here is Caroline Herring's version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCu4Jd-5ZXQ
Hush a bye don't you cry
Hush a bye my pretty baby
When you wake you shall have
All the pretty little ponies
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys
Hush a bye my pretty baby
When you wake you shall have
All the pretty little ponies
