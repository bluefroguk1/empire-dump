Third in "The [[Black Plateau]] Saga"
[[Treasures of Zenith]]
''By Nicassia of Phoenix Reach and Eudaemon of Halcyon [[Spire]]''
By the gates of [[Urizen]]
A tea house stands,
Two [[Naga]] stand ready,
With helping hands.
In the cool, dark tents,
Of [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]]’s Repose,
They’ll soothe your aching mind, 
They’ll soothe your aching bones.
The Solace of our nation,
Their main concern,
Into the [[Realm]] of [[Night]],
Their vision burns.
In their cool, sharp minds,
The pieces slot in place;
They keep our secrets well,
They keep our secrets safe.
They and I and [[Coven|coven]] bold,
The Plateau saw,
They and I and coven bold,
Sought out more.
In the cool, high [[Spires|spires]],
We showed and made our plans,
We knew where we would [[Fight|fight]],
We knew where we would stand.
An [[Arbiter]] then came to call
In dead of night,
He brought with him the message,
The time is right.
In a warm, sick sweat, 
Two [[Naga]] sleeping lie;
It should have been their night,
It should have been their time.
So I’ll sing of our [[Ritual|ritual]]
For all should know,
Of the great deeds done,
On the [[Black Plateau]].
In the heart of the tale,
There always should remain,
Those who know it best,
Elyssian, Elyssiathain.
