Original Song by Jamie Wakefield  (https://soundcloud.com/jamie-wakefield/[[Thorn|thorn]]-battle-cadence) 
[[Chords]]: Am Em G Am
Call
As [[Thorn]]. As [[Thorn]]. Navarri [[Fight|fight]] as [[Thorn]].
Response 1 ''(repeated after each line)''
As [[Thorn]]. As Thorn. Navarri [[Fight|fight]] as Thorn.
[[Calls]]
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri [[Fight|fight]] as Thorn.
In the [[Day|day]] or in the [[Night|night]] we take our victory.
In the dark or in the light we're running through the trees.
Sure and swift, our arrows fly.
Upon our spears, all [[Will|will]] die.
Know no mercy, heed no plea.
You cannot betray your enemy.
The blood [[Will|will]] flow!
Response 2 ''(repeated after each line)''
The blood [[Will|will]] flow!
[[Calls]]
The blood [[Will|will]] flow!
From the wounds of our foes!
From the wounds of our foes!
Their guts we'll spill!
With every kill!
KILL! KILL! KILL!
KILL! KILL! KILL!
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri [[Fight|fight]] as Thorn.
Response 1 ''(repeated after each line)''
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri [[Fight|fight]] as Thorn.
Calls
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.
Know no mercy, heed no plea.
You cannot betray your enemy.
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.
As Thorn. As Thorn. Navarri fight as Thorn.
