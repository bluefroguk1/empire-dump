Words and melody by Claire Sheridan. A recording of the song can be found [https://soundcloud.com/herecosyouare-1/zenos-rest here].
Composed by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach following [[Events]] in Autumn 381YE.
There is a place where hope will never die,
The Onyx Path for us is open wide,
Whatever we embrace,
However dark our fate,
At Zeno’s Rest all stand and stand with [[Pride]].
Through the mud and through the mist the [[Heroes]] came,
Knowing they might never leave again,
All was dark and mire,
But in us there was fire,
To reach that place and hold it just the same.
chorus
They fought with [[Magic]] and with shield and sword,
They fought with guile those pirates from abroad.
With sharks they’ve made a pact,
Sharp-toothéd Spring attacked,
And countless they lay bleeding on the floor.
chorus
Six heroes of [[The Empire]] gave their lives,
For refugees and armies to survive, 
All bloody, broke and torn,
What’s left for those who mourn?
At Zeno’s Rest all stand and stand with Pride.
