An old Marcher song of courtship. 
[[Blow the Candles Out]]
When I was apprenticed in Stockland, I went to see my dear
The candles all were burning, the moon shone bright and clear
I knocked upon her window to ease her out of her pain
She rose up to let me in, then barred the door again
I like well your behaviour and this I often say
I cannot rest contented when I am far away
The roads they are so muddy, we cannot walk about
So roll me in your arms, Love, and [[Blow the Candles Out|blow the candles out]]
Your father and your mother in yonder room do lie
A-hugging one another, so why not you and I?
A-hugging one another, without a fear or doubt
So roll me in your arms, Love, and [[Blow the Candles Out|blow the candles out]]	
I pray thee speak more softly of what we have to do
Lest that our noise of talking should make our pleasure rue
The streets they are so nigh, Love, the people walk about
They may peep in and spy, Love, so blow the candles out
And if we prove successful Love, please name it after me
Treat it neat and kiss it sweet and daft it on your knee
When my two years are over, my time it will be out
And I will pay my debt to you by blowing the candles out.
