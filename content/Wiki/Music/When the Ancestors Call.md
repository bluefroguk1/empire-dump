* Lyrics by Will Kitchen
* [https://soundcloud.com/christopher-clarke-580791164/jotun When the Ancestors Call] on SoundCloud, sung by Chris Clarke and Asha Menai Oldale
When the winter is at an end
And it's time to make war again
When the blood is upon the moon
Ancestors call and we sing this tune
Jotun, Jotun!
Marching to battle, by night or noon
Jotun, Jotun
Ancestors call and we sing this tune!
When we march into hostile land
When our foe is so near at hand
When the battle is starting soon
Ancestors call and we sing this tune
Jotun, Jotun...
When the arrows are whistling in
When blood boils beneath your skin
When their ranks are ripe to prune
Ancestors call and we sing this tune
Jotun, Jotun...
When the column's about to charge
When we set our weapons fast
When the enemy sees their doom
Ancestors call and we sing this tune
Jotun, Jotun...
When the foe is about to break
When they pale and sob and shake
When they flee before our typhoon
Ancestors call and we sing this tune
Jotun, Jotun...
When the foe attacks again
When our lives we must defend
When the heralds offer their boon
Ancestors call and we sing this tune
Jotun, Jotun...
When the battle is done at last
When the wounded are fading fast
When the bodies around are strewn
Ancestors call and we sing this tune
Jotun, Jotun...
When we come to cross the Abyss
When we've felt a steely kiss
When the howling winds do croon
Ancestors call and we sing this tune!
Jotun, Jotun!
Marching to battle, by night or noon
Jotun, Jotun
Ancestors call and we sing this tune!
