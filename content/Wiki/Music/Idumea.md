And am I born to die?
To lay this body down!
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown?
A land﻿ of deepest shade,
Unpierced by human thought
The dreary Regions of the dead,
Where all things are forgot. 
Soon as from earth I go
What will become of me?
As through the Labyrinth I'll go
And then reborn I'll be!
But through the twisting maze,
My soul will find rebirth
To seek the tRuth through night and day
Upon the turning earth!
