And am I born to die?
To lay this body down!
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown?
A land﻿ of deepest shade,
Unpierced by human thought
The dreary regions of the dead,
Where all things are forgot. 
Soon as from earth I go
What [[Will|will]] become of me?
As through the Labyrinth I'll go
And then reborn I'll be!
But through the twisting maze,
My soul [[Will|will]] find rebirth
To seek the truth through [[Night|night]] and [[Day|day]]
Upon the turning earth!
