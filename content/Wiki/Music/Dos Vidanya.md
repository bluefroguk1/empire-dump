Original [[Music]] & Lyrics by Anna Clifford Tait and Stephanie Heath
RECORDING of this song : [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/music/steph/DosVidanya.mp3 [[Dos Vidanya]]]
''Chorus:'' 
Dos vidanya, those who go before us
Dos vidanya, our blood and our heart
Pahka, we'll soon come to meet you
Just for now, good bye and good night.
No tears we weep for you, we understand
Your lives were gave up to appease our cold land
But darkness and hunger, they touch you no more
Now your names are woven into our land's lore (=law: deliberately ambiguous)
The strength that you offered, the kindess you shared
The Visions that drove you, the passions that flared
As long as these mem'ries remain like a spark
Then you remain also, to light up the dark.
''Bridge, kinda:'' 
We whisper your names to the flames
We whisper your names to the flames
We call on the memory of the bargain we made
We whisper your names to the flames
''(Then hum, or repeat bridge as necessary, while those around the fire come forWard and whisper to the fire the names of the lost)''
''(Finally repeat chorus)''
