Original [[Music]] & Lyrics by Anna Clifford Tait and Stephanie Heath
RECORDING of this song : [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/[[Music|music]]/steph/BuildTheFires.mp3 Build The Fires]
Darkness comes, the snow is falling
Check the herd, make sure they're all in
[[Build The Fires High|Build the fires high]] tonight
And may the wolves go hungry
We are the heart that burns in the cold
We are the shepherds guarding the fold
[[Build The Fires High|Build the fires high]] tonight
And may the wolves go hungry
''Chorus:''
''This is the land of our father's children''
''Dark and hungry, secrets hidden''
''Here we stand and this land we'll hold''
Gainst the fear and the cold''
We are the mothers, fathers and brothers
We are the sisters, husbands and lovers
[[Build The Fires High|Build the fires high]] tonight
And may the wolves go hungry
We are the Wardens, clearing your way
We are the ones holding darkness at bay
Build the fires high tonight
And may the wolves go hungry
''Chorus x2''
