[http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/[[Music|music]]/daisy/jack-in-the-green.mp3 Free mp3 of Daisy singing [[Jack in the Green]] with Glasgow Madrigirls.] 
Sheet [[Music|music]] can be found [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/Jack%20in%20the%20Green_noharmony.pdf here] and a harmony version [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/Jack%20in%20the%20Green.pdf here]
"This song has always been very popular with the Ramsbruck [[Family|family]] of [[Bregasland]], to whom Robert of Ramsbruck belonged before he became our ol' Jack. It was [[Sung|sung]] so often that it barely got a reaction - unless the singers venture one of the less-well-known raunchy verses, which sometimes caused a raised eyebrow, or a quiet "Now then" before Jack went back to doing whatever he was doing before."
Now [[Winter]] is over I'm happy to say 
And we're all met again on the first [[Day|day]] of May 
And we're all met again for to dance and to sing 
And to go about dancing with Jack- in - the- Green
''Jack- in - the- Green, Jack- in - the- Green'' 
''And we'll dance every Springtime with Jack- in - the- Green'' 
Now Jack- in - the- Green is a vey strange man 
Though he dies every [[Autumn]] he is born every [[Spring]] 
And each year on his birthday we dance through the streets 
And in return Jack he [[Will|will]] ripen the wheat 
With his mantle he'll cover the trees that are bare 
And our gardens he'll trim with his jacket so fair 
And the fields he [[Will|will]] sow with the hair of his head 
And the corn it will ripen til old Jack is dead 
Now the sun is half up and it tokens the hour 
When the [[Children|children]] arrive with their garlands of flowers 
So now let the music and dancing begin 
And toast the good heart of young Jack- in- the- Green
