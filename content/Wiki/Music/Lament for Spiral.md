Tune based on parts of "Dead Boy's Poem" by Nightwish. 
Words by Claire Sheridan.  [https://soundcloud.com/herecosyouare-1/lament-for-[[Spiral|spiral]] Recording] 
A song written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach at the start of the interregnum. 
[[Lament for Spiral]]
So much silence, silence and darkness,
Towering [[Spires|spires]], empty and [[Gone|gone]],
So much to live for,
So much to die for,
To take back my heart's only home.
Exiled in [[Morrow]], dream of tomorrow,
Destined to drown in your sorrow alone,
Winds blow through [[Spiral]],
Reach for her [[Wisdom]],
Fail, finding nobody.
Every tear that's silently shed,
Only strangthens our resolve,
Ankarien and sister spires,
[[Will]] again be ours to hold.
Seek out the strongholds, seek out the armies,
Scry for truth deep into the [[Night|night]],
So much to live for,
So much to die for,
But we [[Will|will]] not give up the [[Fight|fight]].
Learn all you can learn, strength lies in [[Wisdom]],
Destined to march to my heart's only home,
WInds blow through Spiral,
Reach for her [[Children|children]],
Call, we will soon return. 
Every tear that's silently shed,
Only strangthens our resolve,
Ankarien and sister spires,
Will again be ours to hold.
