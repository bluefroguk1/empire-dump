To the tune of Young Waters as [[Sung|sung]] by June Tabor. 
A [[Guide|guide]] for the tune and the lyrics can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/c/c2/[[The Ballad of Sir Alain|The_Ballad_of_Sir_Alain]].pdf here]. 
Midwinter and the snows fell hard
And the [[Winter|winter]] winds they blew
And there is marched away to [[War|war]]
A household all in blue
Some were fine and some were fair 
And some were strong  and tall
But first amongst them was Sir Alain
The finest of them all
His [[Banner|banner]] it was flown before
And his cloak it flew behind
The sword he bore in his right hand
Was swifter than the wind
The battle raged all through the [[Day|day]]
Till sinking was the sun
And word they sent to their allies there
But answer came there none
Then up spoke the valiant [[Earl|earl]]
Our allies they have flown
And whether we shall live or die
Is in our hands alone.'
'Now see this sword in my right hand'
Sir Alain said with [[Pride|pride]]
'Whether today we live or die 
It shall be at your side'
Then fierce the orcish chieftain fought
And cruel was his sword 
And brave Sir Alain took the blow
That would have slain  his lord
Then up came the rallying cry
And the battle it was won
And they have borne sir Alain home
Beneath [[The setting|the setting]] sun
'Come place my sword in my right hand
For my wounds they grieve me sore
And come the [[Dawn|dawn]] the sun shall rise
But I shall rise no more'
Then up spoke his [[Earl]] Bohemond
And an angry man was he
'They have slain the finest knight 
In all my company.'
Oh many did  weep in [[Dawn]] that [[Night|night]]
And many a heart was sore
When word was come to [[Astolat]]
'Sir Alain comes no more'
Lay him down in honour clad
And speak his name with  [[Pride|pride]] 
For brave and loyal did he live
And gloriously he died.
