To the tune of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obLayCNhbHw Gaudete] (trad), words by Cassiel of Cantiarch's Hold.
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Let our soldiers show their pride as they march to battle, 
Victors strong and standing tall, they are no man's chattel.
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Let their courage know no bounds, death claims those who falter, 
Act in full or bear the shame, whether word or slaughter.
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Lead them boldly from the fore, show your heart’s ambition, 
Willing hearts the greatest fuel, dreams will brings ignition. 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Loyalty can only show, when the lights are fading, 
When darkness comes and men despair, be the beacon guiding.
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
True wealth comes with hardest work, only strong men prosper, 
Those in need should earn thy aid, strength in turn they’ll foster. 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Ever vigilant he stands, he who guards the tower, 
Though his watch is cold alone, in his eyes the power. 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Learn the path that no man walked, knowledge ever growing, 
Share the truths that you have learned, seeds of wisdom sowing.
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand 
Cantiarch, raise your sword against your foeman 
Side by side, in Virtues name we shall stand
