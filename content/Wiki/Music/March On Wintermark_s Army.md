[[March On]] Wintermark's Army by Wulfmear Dunwold.
In the year 377 they took a trip, the men who fought the Druj 
Searching for some kind of salvation 
With head held high and dignified, the townsfolk and the passers-by 
Held them in some kind of admiration. 
[[March On|March on]], Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the Jotun and the Thule, (and the Druj!) 
[[March On|March on]], Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them 
Soldiers in the front line of the struggle for the right to fight 
Were they given these hands just to be idle ? 
While the Emperor and the Senate, in their infinite ancient wisdom 
asked the Mark to join their army.. 
March on, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the Jotun and the Thule, (and the Druj!) 
March on, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them 
And the Jotun and the Thule they all came down, to Anvil town, 
And brought with them the fury and the evil 
But three days now has since [[Gone|gone]] past and they’re all down under the grass 
And Wintermark stands above them in their victory 
March on, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the Jotun and the Thule, (and the Druj!) 
March on, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them? 
March on, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the Jotun and the Thule, (and the Druj!) 
March on, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them?
