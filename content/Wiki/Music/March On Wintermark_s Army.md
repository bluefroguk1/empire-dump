[[March On]] [[Wintermark]]'s Army by Wulfmear Dunwold.
In the year 377 they took a trip, the men who fought the [[Druj]] 
Searching for some kind of salvation 
With head held high and dignified, the townsfolk and the passers-by 
Held them in some kind of admiration. 
March on, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the [[Jotun]] and the [[Thule]], (and the Druj!) 
March on, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them 
Soldiers in the front line of the struggle for the right to [[Fight]] 
Were they given these hands just to be idle ? 
While the Emperor and the Senate, in their infinite ancient [[Wisdom]] 
asked the Mark to join their army.. 
March on, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the Jotun and the Thule, (and the Druj!) 
March on, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them 
And the Jotun and the Thule they all came down, to [[Anvil]] town, 
And brought with them the fury and the evil 
But three days now has since gone past and they’re all down under the grass 
And Wintermark stands above them in their victory 
March On, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the Jotun and the Thule, (and the Druj!) 
March On, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them? 
March On, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the Jotun and the Thule, (and the Druj!) 
March on, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them?
