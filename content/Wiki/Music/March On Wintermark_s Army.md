[[March On]] [[Wintermark]]'s Army by Wulfmear Dunwold.
In the year 377 they took a trip, the men who fought the [[Druj]] 
Searching for some kind of salvation 
With head held high and dignified, the townsfolk and the passers-by 
Held them in some kind of admiration. 
[[March On|March on]], [[Wintermark]];s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the [[Jotun]] and the [[Thule]], (and the [[Druj]]!) 
[[March On|March on]], [[Wintermark]]’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them 
Soldiers in the front line of the struggle for the right to [[Fight|fight]] 
Were they given these hands just to be idle ? 
While the Emperor and [[The Senate|the Senate]], in their infinite ancient [[Wisdom|wisdom]] 
asked the Mark to join their army..

Marching ‘gainst the [[Jotun]] and the [[Thule]], (and the [[Druj]]!) 
[[March On|March on]], [[Wintermark]]’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them 
And the [[Jotun]] and the [[Thule]] they all came down, to [[Anvil]] town, 
And brought with them the fury and the evil 
But three days now has since [[Gone|gone]] past and they’re all down under the grass 
And Wintermark stands above them in their victory 
March on, Wintermark;s great army 
Marching ‘gainst the [[Jotun]] and the [[Thule]], (and the [[Druj]]!) 
March on, Wintermark’s great army 
The lessons that you taught us, who‘ll forget them?
