March out bravely,
From the [[From the Spires Tall]],
Armour shod, sure of foot,
Warriors all,
[[The Empire]] calls us now,
Out we march to [[War]],
Poise in ev’ry movement made,
A silent roar.
Heed the [[General]]’s shout,
Move at his command,
Shield and rod, wand and staff,
Sword at hand.
Strike our foes down,
Move and hold the line,
Weapons swift, eyes aflame,
Banners high.
March then* home again,
To the Spires tall,
Armour shod, victorious,
Warriors all.
 *Can be [[Sung]] as “now” if on the return
