RECORDING of this song : Media:Varushkan-march.mp3
Melody-only version: Media:[[Marching song]].wav
Storms of winter cannot shake us
As to [[War]] we go
Thirst and hunger never break us
Onward through the snow 
Home and hearth we leave behind us
As to war we go
Those we love and [[Ties that Bind]] us
Onward through the snow
Foul Enchantments cannot charm us
As to war we go
Nor can [[Curse]] or witchcraft harm us
Onward through the snow
At our footfall all shall fear us
As to war we go
Foes will quail to venture near us
Onward through the snow
If I fall upon the [[Morrow]]
As to war we go
Raise a cup for me in sorrow
Onward through the snow
Though cruel death may yet divide us
As to War we go
Fallen [[Heroes]] march beside us
Onward through the snow
Hail to those who went before us
As to war we go
Join me now in rousing chorus!
Onward through the snow
