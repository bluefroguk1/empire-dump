RECORDING of this song : Media:varushkan-march.mp3
Melody-only version: Media:[[Marching song|Marching Song]].wav
Storms of [[Winter|winter]] cannot shake us
As to [[War|war]] we go
Thirst and hunger never break us
Onward through the snow 
Home and hearth we leave behind us
As to [[War|war]] we go
Those we love and [[Ties that Bind|ties that bind]] us
Onward through the snow
Foul enchantments cannot charm us
As to [[War|war]] we go
Nor can [[Curse|curse]] or witchcraft harm us
Onward through the snow
At our footfall all shall fear us
As to [[War|war]] we go
Foes [[Will|will]] quail to venture near us
Onward through the snow
If I fall upon the [[Morrow|morrow]]
As to [[War|war]] we go
Raise a cup for me in sorrow
Onward through the snow
Though cruel death may yet divide us
As to war we go
Fallen [[Heroes|heroes]] march beside us
Onward through the snow
Hail to those who went before us
As to war we go
Join me now in rousing chorus!
Onward through the snow
