Come, new light,
For my love,
Send my heart across the [[Cold, Crisp Air|cold, crisp air]].
Clouds must part,
Here above,
So he’ll know that I [[Will|will]] soon be there.
My father said,
We cannot wed,
Still, I long to be in your arms,
Light fills the sky,
To you I’ll fly,
Send my heart across the [[Cold, Crisp Air|cold, crisp air]].
The towers steep,
Hold [[The Key|the key]],
Send my heart across the [[Cold, Crisp Air|cold, crisp air]].
My studies long,
[[Will]] play their part,
So he’ll know that I [[Will|will]] soon be there.
Behind me a note,
On which I wrote,
How I long to be in your arms,
Light fills the sky,
To you I’ll fly,
Send my heart across the [[Cold, Crisp Air|cold, crisp air]].
A flash of light,
An answer true,
Send my heart across the [[Cold, Crisp Air|cold, crisp air]].
I turn to leave,
My life and [[Spire]],
And I know that I [[Will|will]] soon be there.
My father said,
We cannot wed,
Still, I long to be in your arms,
Light fills the sky,
To you I’ll fly,
Send my heart across the cold, crisp air.
There he stands,
Like [[Winter|winter]], cold,
He’s seen my heart across the cold, crisp air.
A sob, a roar,
The icy floor,
He screams that I am never to be there.
My father’s tears,
Fill me with fear,
How I longed to be in your arms,
My heart fills the skies,
Now I must fly,
Send my love across the cold, crisp air.
