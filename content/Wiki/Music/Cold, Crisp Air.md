Come, new light,
For my love,
Send my heart across the [[Cold, Crisp Air]].
Clouds must part,
Here above,
So he’ll know that I will soon be there.
My father said,
We cannot wed,
Still, I long to be in your arms,
Light fills the sky,
To you I’ll fly,
Send my heart across the cold, crisp air.
The towers steep,
Hold the key,
Send my heart across the cold, crisp air.
My studies long,
Will play their part,
So he’ll know that I will soon be there.
Behind me a note,
On which I wrote,
How I long to be in your arms,
Light fills the sky,
To you I’ll fly,
Send my heart across the cold, crisp air.
A flash of light,
An answer true,
Send my heart across the cold, crisp air.
I turn to leave,
My life and [[Spire]],
And I know that I will soon be there.
My father said,
We cannot wed,
Still, I long to be in your arms,
Light fills the sky,
To you I’ll fly,
Send my heart across the Cold, Crisp Air.
There he stands,
Like winter, cold,
He’s seen my heart across the cold, crisp air.
A sob, a roar,
The icy floor,
He screams that I am never to be there.
My father’s tears,
Fill me with fear,
How I longed to be in your arms,
My heart fills the skies,
Now I must fly,
Send my love across the Cold, Crisp Air.
