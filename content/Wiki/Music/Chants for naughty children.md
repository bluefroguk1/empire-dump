Hey Daddy, if I'm not allowed to sing this because it's rude then why did you start laughing as soon as the lady left the tent?
There are a few children's rhymes in [[Dawn]] and [[The Marches]] that are very rude and only [[Sung]] by very naughty children. Expect to get yourself and your parents in trouble if anyone catches you singing this!
To the tune of Freres Jacques.
### Dawnish version
Mucky Marcher, mucky Marcher
You're no good, you're no good
Failed your Test of Mettle, failed your Test of Mettle
Go eat mud, go eat mud!
### Marcher version
Dawnish dandy, Dawnish dandy
Run away, run away
We will do the Fighting, we will do the fighting, 
While you play, while you play!
### Exceptionally Naughty Chant about the Dawnish Sung Only By Extremely Bad Children
In dawn we all get up at noon
I eat my soup with a silver spoon
When I want a cup of tea
I clap my hands and it's made for me
My [[Seneschal]]'s here to wash my hair
I can't go out if he's not there
He'll change my bib when there's food in it
And he wipes my arse when I take a shit
