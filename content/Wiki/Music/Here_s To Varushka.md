To the tune of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= KbT-iA5768 Polushka Polye, lyrics by David Holley 
A wake song, can be [[Sung|sung]] straight or as a round.
Here’s to [[Varushka]], mighty bold [[Varushka]]
Iron of [[The Empire|the Empire]] from your birth
Iron of [[The Empire|the Empire]] from your birth
Here’s to Varushka, bitter cold Varushka
Give our fallen cousins to the earth
Give our fallen cousins to the earth
Here’s to Varushka, steadfast old Varushka
Virtue see your soul to swift rebirth
Virtue see your soul to swift rebirth
