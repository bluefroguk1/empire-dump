[[A Fool in a Crown]]
Written OC and recording by Reesha Dyer. Written IC by Virtue di [[Tassato]]
The actors a fine one for plying his trade,
Looks so superb on the plans that you made,
But take of his mask and you [[Will|will]] be dismayed,
He's made of a much paler shade.
Chorus:
If the actor were true if the [[Bravo|bravo]] were brave,
If up, could only be down,
If only, if only, not one were a phoney,
We'd not have [[A Fool in a Crown|a fool in a crown]].
The trader she seems like a sensible sort,
She tells me there's nothing that cannot be bought,
But when friends are there for [[The Coin|the coin]] in your stores,
What if someone offers more?
Chorus
The [[Bravo|bravo]] talks loudly, and thinks with her sword,
The tales that you hear you can't help but applaud,
If only she wasn't so easily bored,
Liability we can't afford.
Chorus
And then there's the skulker, the servant, the pest,
He thinks that he's puppeting all of the rest,
His pretence of power's a pretty poor jest,
And nobody's really impressed.
