This song is well known in [[Temeschwar]], the Varushkan city that joined [[The League]]. It’s about organised crime, which was once endemic there, and was referred to obliquely as “[[Uncle Vyig]]” (“Uncle [[Vyig]] had his hands in my pockets”, etc). The song is about how crime takes a cut of everything. It a fun song about terrible things, and is also popular as a song to sing with [[Children|children]] in [[Varushka]].
Words by Chris Edwards, tune by Daisy Abbott.

''([[Sung|sung]] fairly slow and deep before each verse)''
When [[Uncle Vyig]] comes to dinner... 
He takes a bite from every onion
Puts his spoon right in your soup
And all the poultry that he eats
Could fill a chicken coop!
When Uncle Vyig comes to dinner...
He goes through all your clothing
And borrows just one boot
He helps himself to gloves and hats
And the socks right off your foot!
When Uncle Vyig comes to dinner...
He sits right by the fire
And leaves you all to freeze
His bones are scrawny, thin and cold
But he shares with you his sneeze! (ATCHOO!)
