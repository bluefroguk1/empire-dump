Verse 1
Miaren, Miaren,
Will we meet again,
At journey's end,
Miaren?
Oh dream, oh jewel,
Of Terunael,
Do tell me when,
Miaren.
How I recall,
Your towers of yore,
That once filled the blue skies,
Now Ruined and worn.
But then, Miaren,
We'll see you again,
In new Seren,   
Miaren.
Verse 2
Oh new, Seren,
Our only haven.
From you we will,
Rebuild.
Our dream, our jewel,
Of Terunael,
Begins anew,
with you.
But oh... the road,
Calls ever to roam,
And walking the long trods,
I long for my home.
But then, Seren,
I'll see you again.
At Journey's end
Miaren
Bridge ''(Repeat a few times)''
But the road, but the road,
Calls ever to roam.
And walking the long trods,
I long for my home.
Coda
But then, Seren,
I'll see you again,
When journey's end,
Miaren.
When journey's end,
Miaren.
