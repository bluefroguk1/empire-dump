[[The Ritual On The Black Plateau|The Ritual on the Black Plateau]]
''By Nicassia of Phoenix Reach and Eudaemon of Halcyon Spire''
It began on a starry night, 
Talk of the madness of the [[Black Plateau]],
We were told our time had come,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Citizens were gathered, plans were laid that night,
Shone light on our work so all would know,
With the Twins’ assent, we’d end the foul torment,
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home. 
The Ritualists took up the task,  
Talk of the madness of the [[Black Plateau]],
To mark out the vital sign,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Gather up the mana: lay it out with chord,
Bring all you can bring to make it so,
Now by Virtue’s light, we must get it right,
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.
The Sentinels took up the task,
Talk of the madness of the Black Plateau,
To consider every foe,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Highguard played the madmen at our captains’ word,
The Cultist’s dance performed just so,
Sword and rod and shield were bound to make them yield,
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.
The Urizen went out the gate,
Talk of the madness of the Black Plateau,
Now to use what they had learned,
Bring to bear Poise and Arête both:
Madmen rushed the circle as we laid it down,
As inside, so without, we fought the foe,
For our blood they cried, even as they died.
We’d make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.
With our Archmage at the fore,
Talk of the madness of the Black Plateau,
And the General close at hand,
Bring to bear Poise and Arete both:
Egregore stepped forward to the circle’s heart, 
As Eudaemon pulled the magic’s flow, 
Nicassia repelled them, Vulpes struck them down, 
To make Spiral a place we’d once again call home.
Now don’t rest your mind too soon,
Talk of the madness of the Black Plateau,
Though a great wound has been healed,
Bring to bear Poise and Arete both:
Peace is settling gently, minds are whole again, 
But this is not over we all know,
We have work to do and we must stay true,
To make Spiral a place we’ll once again call home.
