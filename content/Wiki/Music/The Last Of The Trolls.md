A story song adapted by Wulfmear Dunwold. Original lyrics are from [https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Last_of_the_Giants The Last of the Giants] in A Storm of Swords by George RR Martin. 
Oh I am [[The Last Of The Trolls]], my people are gone from the earth,
The last of the great mountain trolls, who ruled the world at my birth.
Oh the men have stolen my Forests and glens , stolen my rivers and hills,
Built castles and towns in my valleys and peaks, and fished all the fish from my rills.
Oh I am the last of the trolls, so learn well the words of my song,
For the singing will fade, and the silence shall last, when I am finally gone
In the stone halls they burn, many great fires, in stone halls the forge their sharp spears,
Whilst I walk alone in The Mountains and mist, with no true friend but my tears.
They hunt me with dogs in the rain and the snow, they hunt me with torches by night,
For those men who are small can never stand tall, whilst trolls still walk in the light.
Oh I am the last of the trolls, so learn well the words of my song,
For the singing will fade, and the silence shall last, when I am finally gone.
Oh the [[Runes]] I have made and the [[Magic]] I dreamed, was an ancient and powerful thing.
But the world it has turned and the magic is gone, only left in the words that I sing.
Now the people of old are buried and gone, torn down by mortal fears.
And the conquerorâ€™s crown glitters so cold, borne down by frozen tears.
Oh I am the last of the trolls, so learn well the words of my song,
For the singing will fade, and the silence shall last, when I am finally gone.
When I am finally gone...
