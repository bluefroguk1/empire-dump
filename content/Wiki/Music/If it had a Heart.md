Original Song: If I had a Heart by Fever Ray (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBAzlNJonO8)
New lyrics by Gabrielle Falquero
Thought it couldn’t end and wanted more
More, then Vallorn, then Vallorn
Thought it couldn’t end and wanted more
More, then Vallorn, then Vallorn
[[If it had a Heart|If it had a heart]] it would hate you
If it had a voice to scream
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings
Aaaaaah aaaaaah
aaaaaahhh ... If it had a voice to scream
Dragging feet, a husk insane
Will it ever ever reach the floor?
More, then Vallorn, then Vallorn
Crushed and filled with all it found
underneath and inside just to come around
More, then Vallorn, then Vallorn
Aaaaaah aaaaaah
aaaaaahhh ... If it had a voice to scream
