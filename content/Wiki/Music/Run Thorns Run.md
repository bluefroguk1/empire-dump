Adapted from "Roll Boys Roll" (trad) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhvjtM17uRU)
Lyrics and Melody adapted by Joshua Binks.
Call
Sally Brown, she’s the gal for me, Thorns
Response
Run Thorns, [[Run Thorns Run]].
Calls
Sally Brown, she’s the gal for me, Thorns
Down to [[The Marches]] to see Sally Brown, Thorns
Down to The Marches to see Sally Brown, Thorns
Oh, there's forty leagues or more to go, Thorns
Oh, forty leagues or more to go, Thorns
She's lovely up above, and she's lovely down below, Thorns
She's lovely cause she loves me, that’s all I need to know, Thorns
With blade and spear to cast down the foe, Thorns
Oh, with blade and spear to cast down the foe, Thorns,
Oh, one more stride, don'tcha hear the [[Brand]] a-bawling?
Oh, one more stride, that's the end of our hawling.
Sally Brown, she’s the gal for me, Thorns
Sally Brown, she’s the gal for me, Thorns
