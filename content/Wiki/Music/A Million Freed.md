The song was provided by Tiana i Zaydan i [[Riqueza]] to Dream-Singer - a herald of [[Lashonar]], who requested four songs of the [[High Bard of the Empire]].
Lyrics by SaguaI’Ezmara, [[Music]] to the tune of A Million Dreams
I close my eyes and I can see
[[Ambition]] waiting there for me
To be shared once shown
Through the dark, through [[The Door]]
Through the locks and chains and more
To bring them home
Chorus:
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world virtue defines.
'Cause every night I lie in bed
The darkest Visions fill my head
A million slaves are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
[[A Million Freed]] is all it's gonna take
A million freed from The Chains we're gonna break
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With folk from far away
Travelling across the miles
There to laugh and dance and smile
They have found [[The Way]].
(chorus)
However big, however small
We need to defend them all
Time to set them free
[[Fight]] for what’s right, slaving is wrong
But say that you'll join in the song
For the world we see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see
Every night I lie in bed
This great ambition fills my head
A million slaves are keeping me awake
(A million freed, a million freed)
I think of what the world could be
One where everyone is free
A million freed is all it's gonna take
A million freed from the chains we're gonna break
From the chains we're gonna break.
