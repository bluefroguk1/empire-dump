The [[Grendel]] say they ride the waves,
Those waves [[Will|will]] broke upon our shields.
The [[Grendel]] say they’re born of stone,
Before our blades even stone yields.
[chorus]
[[March On|March on]] now [[Jotun]],
Now [[Jotun]] [[Fight|fight]]!
Hold firm now Jotun,
None can stand before our might!
The [[Thule]]’s slaves toil in their mines,
Yegarra to become, they pray.
Their leaders call themselves Dragons,
But there’s no beast we cannot slay.
The forests of [[Liathaven]],
Teem with [[Vallorn|vallorn]] monstrosities.
The Jotun [[Will|will]] drive them all out,
If we must fell every tree.
The winterfolk may oft' [[Fight|fight]] true,
Deep in snow on frozen plains.
But soon enough we will break through,
And strike five down for each orc slain.
The Navaari are most foul,
[[Venom]] drips from every blade.
The daggers of the human [[Druj]],
Shall break themselves on Jotun plate.
Ancestors now hear my voice,
As I fight the honoured foe.
We'll give all of them the Choice,
Join us now or be [[Laid low|laid low]].
