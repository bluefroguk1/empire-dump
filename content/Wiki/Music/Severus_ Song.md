Words and tune by Claire Sheridan. 
Manuscript by Aneurin Redman-White [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/5/51/Severus_Song.pdf PDF] here
Written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach after the death of Captain Severus of Phoenix Reach. He was the founder and leader of Severus' Severed, at the time a group of travelling Sentinels learning to fight on the slopes of Urizen. He fell fighting in the Barrens in the Winter of 378. May his passage through the Labyrinth be swift. 
Come one, come all,
Who walk in the mountains,
Come bring your weapons,
And bring your wiles, 
Come keep the boarders,
And the passes of Urizen,
The Severed are marching
Out again. 
Severus stands in his plume and armour,
New recruit has lost his bow,
He'll have to get himself another one,
From the hand of a new-slain foe.
Living's hard when you're loose on a mountain,
Sleeping's hard when you sleep on rock,
But you can drink and sing and do what you like,
As long as you're up in the morning. 
Severus leads from the front of his war band
Training Sentinels row on row,
It doesn't matter if you're new to Urizen,
As long as you're against the foe.
Fighting's hard in the snow storms and hail,
Dying's hard in the wind and rain,
But you can drink and sing and do what you like,
As long as you're up in the morning. 
Severus died on the fields of the barrens,
Leading the Reach to fill the hole,
He fought with Pride and he fought with Courage,
That's sure to speed his mortal soul. 
Living's good when you're free on a mountain,
With someone to lead you on the way,
And you can drink and sing and do what you like,
As long as you're up in the morning. 
Come one, come all,
Who walk in the mountains,
Come bring your weapons,
And bring your wiles, 
Come keep the boarders,
And the passes of Urizen,
The Severed are marching
Home again.
