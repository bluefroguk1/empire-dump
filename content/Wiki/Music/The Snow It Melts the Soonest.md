The snows they melt the soonest
When the winds begins to sing 
And the corn it ripend fastest
When the frosts are settling in
And when a woman tells me
That my face she'll soon forget
Before we part I'll wage a crown
She's fain to follow yet
The snows they melt the soonest
When the winds begin to sing
And the swallow flies without a thought
As long as it is [[Spring|spring]]
But when spring goes and [[Winter|winter]] blows
My love then you'll be fain
For all your [[Pride|pride]] to follow me
Across the raging main
The snows they melt the soonest
When the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when [[Summer|summer]] shone
In winter cannot sting
And I've seen a woman's anger melt
Between the [[Night|night]] and morn
So it's surely not a harder thing
To melt a woman's scorn
So don't you bid me farewell here
No farewell I'll receive 
For you [[Will|will]] lie with me, my lass
Then kiss and take your leave
And I'll wait here till the moorcrock [[Calls|calls]]
And the martin takes the wing
For the snow they melt the soonest
When the winds begin to sing
