Original: [[Least of my Kind]] by Three Weird Sisters, found [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgCdDkmh5bo here], adapted by by Katherine Faber.
A pdf of the words and [[Music]] can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/d/db/[[Least_of_my_Kind]].pdf here].
Covered in dirt and mud, aching and spitting blood
Cursing, you start to rise and groan.
Far off through field and fell mutters the [[Chapter]] bell:
Never a Guardian falls alone
Chorus:
Think on the battle’s [[Cost]]; this time the Lancer lost
Beaten and broken and blind.
Better beWare one more, better prepare for [[War]]:
I was the least of my kind.
Prying my arrows cold out of my fingers’ hold
Pause to take stock, reflect and rue;
Look on the damage done here by a single one
What do you think a whole Lance will do?
Chorus
Bury me where I fall, far from the Chapter’s Call;
Slain in a [[Fight]] I could not win;
Nearby, [[Unconquered]] hear, heads turn with pricking ears
Thought you, you fool, that I had no kin?
