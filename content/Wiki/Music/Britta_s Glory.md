And it’s Charge, [[Dawn]], Charge,
We’ll [[Fight|fight]] with every breath
And every step we take today is one step nearer death
But we’ll charge
Oh she marched across [[The Empire|the Empire]] and she blazed into each heart
Warrior and [[General|general]], bright as flame she stood apart
With thunder all around her and with fire upon her brow
To keep our Empire free from harm she made her solemn vow
Chorus
The [[Jotun]] threat had hit them hard, but still the west she won
Out to the East so fast she flew, she shone just like the Sun
Side by side with [[Dawn]] she stood, at bloody Summerholm
And crystal clear it was to all our Empress had come home
Chorus
Her Virtue strong and splendid, made an Empire’s life-blood beat
With fire and steel and fury, all her foes they met defeat
Until one bitter [[Winter|winter]] when at [[Skarsind]] battle found
The Young Empress had perished, lying dead on frozen ground
Chorus
Now we’re marching out from [[Anvil]] underneath a weeping sky
For [[Glory]] and for Vengeance with our banners raised up high
We’ll make them fear her memory, cast them down into the mud
For [[Throne]] and Crown and Britta, we [[Will|will]] make them [[Pay in blood|pay in blood]]!
Chorus
