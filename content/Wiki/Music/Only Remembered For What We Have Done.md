Fading away like the stars in the morning
Losing their light in the glorious sun
Thus would we pass from this earth and its toiling
[[Only Remembered For What We Have Done|Only remembered for what we have done]]
Only the truth in the fife we have spoken
Only the seed that in life we have sown
These shall pass onwards when we are forgotten
[[Only Remembered For What We Have Done|Only remembered for what we have done]]
Who'll sing the anthem and who'll tell the story
Will the line hold will it scatter and run
Shall we at last be united in glory
[[Only Remembered For What We Have Done|Only remembered for what we have done]]
