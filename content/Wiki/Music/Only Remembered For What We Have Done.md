Fading away like the stars in the morning
Losing their light in the glorious sun
Thus would we pass from this earth and its toiling
[[Only Remembered For What We Have Done]]
Only the tRuth in the fife we have spoken
Only the seed that in life we have sown
These shall pass onWards when we are forgotten
Only remembered for what we have done
Who'll sing the anthem and who'll tell the story
Will the line hold will it scatter and run
Shall we at last be united in [[Glory]]
Only remembered for what we have done
