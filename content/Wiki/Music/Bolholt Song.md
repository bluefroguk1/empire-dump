Tune by Kathryn Wheeler, lyrics by Jude Reid
Bregaslanders, [[Blood and Bone|blood and bone]]
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
Strong as iron, hard as stone
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
Hard at work by [[Day|day]] and [[Night|night]]
Never beaten in the [[Fight|fight]]
''[[Courage]], [[Pride|pride]] and [[Loyalty|loyalty]]''
''Marcher yeomen are we''
For the land we'll tireless toil
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
Golden corn and rich brown soil
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
By our oath and duty bound
Loyal as a hunting hound
''[[Courage]], [[Pride|pride]] and [[Loyalty|loyalty]]''
''Marcher yeomen are we''
Bolholt maids have beauty rare
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
In all [[The Empire|the Empire]] none so fair
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
Bolholt lads are stout and strong
Handsome as the day is long
''[[Courage]], [[Pride|pride]] and [[Loyalty|loyalty]]''
''Marcher yeomen are we''
Fearsome foes wait on the field
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
Still we'll [[Fight|fight]] and never yield
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
Raise the [[Banner|banner]] up on high
Now they'll hear the battle cry
''[[Courage]], [[Pride|pride]] and [[Loyalty|loyalty]]''
''Marcher yeomen are we''
Time to put aside your plough
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
March with me to battle now
''Bolholt! Bolholt!''
On to victory or death
Never fail while we draw breath
''[[Courage]], [[Pride|pride]] and [[Loyalty|loyalty]]''
''Marcher yeomen are we''
