Original [[Music]] & Lyrics by Anna Clifford Tait and Stephanie Heath
RECORDING of this song : [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/[[Music|music]]/steph/IfVarushkaWills.mp3 If Varushka Wills]
Come listen to my song
Join in and sing along
The fire burns, its orange light
Will keep us safe all through the night.
Tell a tale, play your part
Burns the fire, burns the heart
Play and sing, drink and dance
Now's your moment, now's your chance.
Find the path through dark and cold
Man and woman, young and old
Keep the fire, keep the spark
Keep us dancing through the dark.
Winter cares not for your name
Dark will take us all the same
Hold together, standing strong
Noise and [[Music|music]], bind our throng.
Turns the season, turns the wheel
Hunger bites, a sting like steel
Passions burn through snow and ice
Our family, our land, our life.
We are many, we are one
Come together, day is done
Gainst the darkness, gainst the night
Build our shield of blood and light
Share our warmth, take a hand
Tap your feet and join our band
Through the night the flames grow higher
To match the dancers, flying fire
What the morrow brings, who knows?
Still the river onward flows
Will we all be standing still?
[[If Varushka Wills|If Varushka wills]], we will!
