## The [[Music]] of The Brass Coast
### Style summary
Like the Freeborn themselves, their [[Music|music]] is rhythmic, vigorous and fiery. Waily reeded or brass instruments, rich vocal harmonies and the strumming of strings resound in counterpoint with the ever-present syncopation of drums, tambourines and claves. It is said a Freeborn will make an instrument out of anything - hands, cutlery, tables and crockery are all used to enthusiastically accompany performers. Their vocal tradition involves not only the singing of complex melodies and accompaniment but also encourages others to join in ululating harmonies, drones and chants. The overall impression is vibrant, noisy and enthusiastic - [[Music|music]], like everything in their lives, is to be savoured to the utmost.
Brass Coast music draws on the real world inspiration of Corsican music, Spanish Pilgrim songs, Italian lauda, and New World sea shanties. Although they are a seafaring nation, more traditional English shanties (such as Poor Tom Bowling, The Mermaid etc.) would be better suited to the musical tradition of the Marches.
### Commonly known songs
* [[Riqueza's Dream]]  Telling one version of the tale of the [[The Brass Coast history|founding of the Brass Coast]] this song is popular in taverns and Alcazars. It has sparked off several diplomatic incidents by 'accidentally' offending Highborn visitors.

### Instrumentation and tunes
High percussion e.g. tambourines, shakers, clapping, high drums; reeded woodwind (especially if a bit waily and 'snake charmer' sounding); high metallic pipes/penny whistles; jangly bouzoukis or guitars.
### Other performance traditions
* Dance/fire dance, a huge part of [[Brass Coast Magical Traditions]].
### How to adapt your repertoire
* Never perform without giving your audience a way to join in. Get them clapping or stomping, or tell them to cheer or repeat when they hear certain words. If you are ambitious teach them a simple ostinato to go under the song. It's all about the participation!
* Rhythms could be much lighter than other nations, keep them syncopated (off beat), and on tambourines, castanets, shakers, or light drums. Keep your playing light and bouncy!
* Don't be afraid to ornament when you are singing, have a listen to some waily Spanish or Arabic medieval music and copy the style into the songs you are choosing.
