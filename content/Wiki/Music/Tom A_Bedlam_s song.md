There's a recording of the song here:
https://soundcloud.com/ubermodo/tom-o-bedlam
A slightly more suitable set of lyrics are:
From the hagg and hungrie goblin
That into raggs would rend ye, 
And the spirit that stands by the naked man 
In the Book of Moones - defend ye!
That of your five sound senses
You never be forsaken,
Nor wander from your selves with Tom
Abroad to beg your bacon.
While I doe sing "any foode, any feeding,
Feedinge, drinke or clothing,"
Sweet Cit'zens all, be not afraid,
Poor Tom will injure nothing.
Of thirty bare years have I
Twice twenty been enraged,
And of forty been three times fifteen
In durance soundly caged.
On the lordly lofts of Bedlam,
With stubble soft and dainty,
Brave bracelets strong, sweet whips ding-dong,
With wholesome hunger plenty.
While I doe sing "any foode, any feeding,
Feedinge, drinke or clothing,"
Sweet Cit'zens all, be not afraid,
Poor Tom will injure nothing.
With a thought I took for Maudlin
And a cruse of cockle pottage,
With a thing thus tall, skie blesse you all,
I befell into this dotage.
I slept not since the Marching,
Till then I never waked,
Till the roguish boy of love where I lay
Me found and stript me naked.	 
While I doe sing "any foode, any feeding,
Feedinge, drinke or clothing,"
Sweet Cit'zens all, be not afraid,
Poor Tom will injure nothing.
When I short have shorne my sowre face
And swigged my horny barrel,
In an oaken inn I pound my skin
As a suit of gilt apparel.
The moon's my constant 'panion,
And the lowly owl my Morrowe,
The flaming Drake and the Nightcrow make
Me [[Music]] to my sorrow.
While I doe sing "any foode, any feeding,
Feedinge, drinke or clothing,"
Sweet Cit'zens all, be not afraid,
Poor Tom will injure nothing.
The [[Bravo]], [[Druj]] and [[Grendel]]
Are none of Tom's companions.
The punk I skorne and the cut purse sworne
And the roaring boyes bravadoe.
The meek, the white, the gentle,
Me handle touch and spare not
But those that crosse Tom Rynosseros
Do what the panther dare not.
While I doe sing "any foode, any feeding,
Feedinge, drinke or clothing,"
Sweet Cit'zens all, be not afraid,
Poor Tom will injure nothing.
With a host of furious fancies
Whereof I am commander,
With a [[Burning]] spear and a [[Horse]] of air,
To the wilderness I wander.
By a knight of ghostes and shadowes
I summon'd am to tourney
Ten leagues beyond the wild world's end.
Methinks it is no journey.
While I doe sing "any foode, any feeding,
Feedinge, drinke or clothing,"
Sweet Cit'zens all, be not afraid,
Poor Tom will injure nothing.
