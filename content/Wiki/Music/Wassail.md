1. O Mistress, at your door our Wassail begin(s), Pray open [[The Door]], and let us come in,
''Refrain:''
''With our Wassail, Wassail, Wassail, Wassail,''
''And joy come to our jolly Wassail!''
2. O Mistress, at your door we kindly salute, For it is an old custom you cannot dispute, With our Wassail, etc.
3. O Mistress and Master, sitting down by the fire, While we poor Wassail-men are travelling thro' the mire, With our Wassail, etc.
4. O Mistress and Master, sitting down at your ease, With their hands in their pockets to give what they please To our Wassail, etc.
5. Come young men and maidens, I pray you draw near; Come fill up our bowl with some cider or beer, With our Wassail, etc.
6. You see how we'll smile at our flowing Bowl — Just now it is empty, by-and-bye it'll be full, With our Wassail, etc.
7. I wish you a good Harvest and a Prosperous Year, And plenty of money and a barrel of beer, With our Wassail, etc.
8. I wish you a blessing, and a long time to live, Because you're so free and so willing to give To our Wassail, etc.
And plenty more, which can be improVised! E.g.
I hope that your apples will prosper and grow, That you may have cider and a plenty to bestow, To our Wassail, etc.
I hope that your barley may prosper and grow, That you may have beer and a plenty to bestow, To our Wassail, etc.

1.We've been a -while a wandering 
Amongst the leaves so green. 
But now we come a wassailing 
So plainly to be seen,
Chorus
''For it's [[Harvest Time]], when we travel far and near; 
We wish your crops Health and a prosperous year.''
We are not daily beggars 
That beg from door to door; 
We are your neighbors children, 
For we've been here before
Call up the SteSteward of this house
Likewise the yeomen too, 
And all the little children 
That round the table go
Bring us out a table 
And spread it with a cloth, 
Bring us out a mouldy cheese 
And some of your wheaten loaf; 
Good master and good mistress, 
While you're sitting by the fire, 
Pray think of us poor children 
That's wandered in the mire

     Now the harvest being over 
     And winter drawing in 
     Please open your door 
     And let us come in 
     With our wassail
     Wassail, wassail 
     And joy come to our jolly wassail
     Here's the master and mistress 
     Sitting down by the fire 
     While we poor wassail boys 
     Do trudge through the mire 
     With our wassail
     Wassail, wassail 
     And joy come to our jolly wassail
     Here's the master and mistress 
     Sitting down at their ease 
     Put your hands in your pockets 
     And give what you please 
     With our wassail
     Wassail, wassail 
     And joy come to our jolly wassail
     This ancient old house 
     We will kindly salute 
     It is your custom 
     You need not dispute 
     With our wassail
     Wassail, wassail 
     And joy come to our jolly wassail
     Here's the saddle and the bridle 
     They're hung upon the shelf 
     If you want any more 
     You can it sing yourself 
     With our wassail
     Wassail, wassail 
     And joy come to our jolly wassail
     Here's an health to the master 
     And a long time to live 
     Since you've been so kind 
     And so willing to give 
     With our wassail
     Wassail, wassail 
     And joy come to 
     our jolly wassail
