### [[Hungry Goat]] Song
Lyrics by Jude
Melody traditional Gaelic, as [[Sung]] by Karine PolWart here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSsmZsZhVac&feature=youtube_gdata_player
Early in the morning
And without any warning
My goat ate all the pants
That were hanging on the line
Chorus:
Goaty, goaty, hungry little goaty
Goaty, goaty, hungry all the time
Daddy went to borrow
Some pants to wear toMorrow
But the goat had eaten mummy's
And had eaten all of [[Mine]]
Chorus:
Goaty, goaty, hungry little goaty
Goaty, goaty, hungry all the time
Daddy started cursing
And the goat looked fUll to bursting 
But it went back to the washing
'cause we didn't see in time 
Chorus:
Goaty, goaty, hungry little goaty
Goaty, goaty, hungry all the time
So later in the morning
And with hardly any warning
My goat ate all the socks 
That were hanging on the line...
(repeat with other articles of clothing)
