All across [[The Marches|the Marches]], and indeed [[The Empire|the Empire]], those who have set themselves to the task of taking back the [[Mournwold]] have taken to wearing the Mourn Flag, be it on their cap, on the breast of their tunic to wherever. Some wear the blossom, and some a badge cast of tin, or of welt-silver or [[Green iron|green iron]], as their [[Prosperity|prosperity]] allows.
The Mourn Flag (or Miner's Mate) is a hardy flower that blooms year-round. It favours broken or disturbed ground, growing thick on old [[Mine|mine]] tailings, over graves, and on hillsides where there is runoff from a Green Iron vein that's broken the surface. Canny miners [[Will|will]] look for beds of the flower, and follow them up-slope up the hill, and like as not theyâ€™ll find a spot [[Worth|worth]] mining.
Some sing it to the Marcher hymn, "[http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/mournflag.mp3 [[Good Walder]]'s Progress]" ([[Music|music]] by Kathryn Wheeler), some to the old Highborn processional [[Virtues Anthem]] 
Lyrics by Dan Towse  
A recording of this song can be found [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/mournflag.mp3 here] 
The Mourn Flag blooms when 'Wolder's work is done
Where Green Iron's mined or Miner's laid to rest.
And now [[The Marches|the Marches]]' labour has begun, 
We'll [[Muster|muster]] every virtue, give our best,
Refrain:
And if by chance we fall and come to lie
Beneath the Wold, there let the Mourn Flag fly.
To free the Mourn with blood and sweat and toil
And plough the Wold thrice o'er from March to Moor
Each Soldier, Farmer, [[Alderman]], all loyal
[[Will]] give their all, though prosperous or poor.
Refrain
So pluck the Miners Mate and wear its flower 
All you who strive to break the [[Jotun]]'s Hold
Till by our works and our collective power
The [[Marches]] Bounds are Beaten round [[Mournwold]].
Refrain
