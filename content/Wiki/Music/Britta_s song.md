Bad news, bad news came to me where I sat,
Turn, turn, turn again,
The Empress' army are not coming back,
Turn, turn, to the rain and the wind.
The Empress' army were gallant and true,
Turn...
They went off to war and they would see it through,
Turn...
They had mages with mana and warriors with swords,
Turn...
Shieldsmen and pikemen would have their reward,
Turn...
To protect our Empire from the Thule out beyond,
Turn...
With axe and with arrow, with rod and with wand,
Turn...
They raised up the banner and raised up the cry,
Turn...
Out into the mountains and grey snow-hung sky,
Turn...
Their scouts they were cunning, their fighters so brave,
Turn...
In the hope that this territ'ry to finally reclaim
Turn...
But the Thule they were ruthless; they called down a storm,
Turn...
Of snow, hail and chill winds all magically-borne,
Turn...
Our Britta was sure they had not come in vain,
Turn...
Determined that Skarsind would be ours again,
Turn...
Stout resolve was gifted to all,
Turn...
So the army would fight on and not too soon fall,
Turn...
But it was not enough against such a foe,
Turn...
And out in the mountains the bitter winds moan,
The old song, the rain and the wind.
So you now, and I, friend, must make the attack,
Turn, turn, turn again,
The Empress' army are not coming back.
Turn, turn, to the rain and the wind.
