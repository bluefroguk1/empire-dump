## The [[Music]] of Highguard
### Style summary
Highguard's [[Music|music]] draws its inspiration from Western church choral [[Music|music]], plainsong and shapenote music (also known as Sacred Harp). Of these, the last probably best exemplifies the musical style - [[Highguard Music|Highguard music]] is robust and enthusiastic, and accessible to all levels of talent. They enjoy rich harmonies and proudly devotional texts, although amongst themselves a wicked sense of humour occasionally emerges in some soldiers' songs and there are also some surprisingly tender lullabies.
### Commonly known songs
* [[Virtues Anthem]] - usually led by one singer with everyone joining in the refrain
* [[Circle March]] - very easy repeating song
* [[Hymn to Vigilance]] - usually led by one singer with everyone joining in the refrain
Popular with all strata of Highguard society, these three songs are heard in chapters, the necropolis, and the fields. It is when the army marches to war with its battle choir, however, that the full majesty of [[Highguard Music|Highguard music]] is best displayed.
### A musical tradition
The Highguard Battle Choirs are a great imperial tradition - no nation marches to battle with the same holy fervour in their singing. Usually accompanied by a single drumbeat, the sound of the Highguard army in full voice is an awe-inspiring and intimidating sound. Often a small number of more confident singers lead the chant in a call-and-response pattern. At least in this context the choirsters are warriors first and musicians second - the singers need not be particularly talented, as it is holy fervour and their indomitable will that characterises the battle choir.

### Other performance traditions
### How to adapt your repertoire
* If singing in harmony, try to sing in consecutive 4ths or 5ths. This gives a fantastic 'plainchanty' sound perfect for Highguard. An example is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xti9lXz3lVI [[Circle March]] (arranged by Katy Cooper)] which starts in unison then goes into 4ths before full harmony.
* Many songs can be made to sound plainchanty by just pulling the rhythm all over the place. Have a listen to some church psalms and simply substitute your own lyrics.
