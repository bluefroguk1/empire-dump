Though it's way past [[Harvest Time|harvest time]]
Some still toil and work and wagons rattle
Corn still stands in rank and line
And defies us all
We can see it in our past
Blood will out and joy will battle
Though we work in different ways we're [[Bringing in the Sheaves|bringing in the sheaves]]
(Chorus) - [[Bringing in the Sheaves|Bringing in the sheaves]], we're bringing in the sheaves. 
Though we work in different ways we're bringing in the sheaves
Though we started from the land
Some of us do roam abroad
The hand upon the gliding plough is not for everyone
Changing seasons help us see
Those who hear a different drummer
Though not in one harmony, we're bringing in the sheaves
(Chorus)
What lay dormant in the soil
Is wakened by the kiss of summer
So the fruits of yesteryear become the years new corn
Every stem has at its core, part of those who went before
In turn they will be kept in store by bringing the sheaves
(Chorus)
In conclusion bear in mind
What example has begun
What today you do in kind has power for everyone
True strong aims will pass along
To your daughters and your sons
So may they in years to come be bringing in the sheaves
(Chorus)
