* To the tune of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIwzRkjn86w| Barrett’s Privateer's] by Stan Rogers
* Adapted by Will Kitchen
Oh, the year was three and sixty-eight, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
A letter of marque come from the salt lords,
To the scummiest vessel I ever have saw,
So damn them all!
I was told we'd sail the seas for Imperial gold!
We'd loose no bolts, shed no tears…
Now I'm a broken orc on a Broken Shore pier,
The last of Sarrett's Privateers!
Oh, Darvid Sarrett cried the town, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
For twenty brave orcs all fisherfolk who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
So damn them all...
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
It'd a list to the port and and its sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and the jags
So damn them all…
On the first of spring we put to sea, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
We were 91 days round Catazar Bay
Pumping like madmen All [[All the way]]
So damn…
On the 96th day we sailed again, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
When a bloody great Leaguer hove in sight
With our slack ballista we made to [[Fight]]
So damn...
The Leaguer lay low down with gold, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
It was broad and fat and loose in stays
But to catch it took the Antelope two whole days
So damn…
Then at length we stood two cables away, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
Our slack ballista made an awful din
But with one fat bolt they stove us in
So damn…
The Antelope shook and pitched on its side, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
Sarrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the main-trunk carried off both me legs
So damn…
So here I lay in my 23rd year, HOW I WISH I WAS IN DUBHTRAIG NOW!
It's been six years since we sailed away
And I just made Broken Shore yesterday
So damn them all!
I was told we'd sail the seas for Imperial gold!
We'd loose no bolts, shed no tears…
Now I'm a broken orc on a Broken Shore pier,
The last of Sarrett's Privateers!
