Words and [[Music]] by Jude
In The Gardens by the riverside the fragrant rose-trees grow,
Where you and I once walked, my love, so many moons ago.
You picked for me a single rose that blossomed on the bough-
But that was long ago, my love, and all is different now.
When Summer follows Spring again the roses catch the breeze
That whispers through the long green grass and rustles in the trees
We walked the gardens hand in hand, when all was new and strange,
But that was long ago, my love, and all things come to change. 
In [[Astolat]], as I hear tell, the rose-trees bloom once more,
Though we no longer wander there, as once we did before,
When we joined hands beneath the trees, and vowed to come again,
But that was long ago, my love â€“ and all was different then.
