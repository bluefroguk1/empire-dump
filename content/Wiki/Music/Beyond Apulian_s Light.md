Beyond Apulian’s Light
''Ithamar [[Legacy]]''
When I was young and scarce eighteen
They said I lacked for poise;
With book or wand was seldom seen
But wine and handsome boys.
My parents to my great dismay
Did vow to set me right;
They said I’d learn my [[Arete|arete]]
Beyond Apulian’s light.
Apprenticed to a sailing crew
And set aboard in haste,
From captain’s lips the order flew
“There is no time to waste!”
They weighed the anchor, shook out sail
And soon we were in flight
To southward on a [[Summer|summer]] gale
Beyond Apulian’s light.
Now as time fled I bolder grew
And seasoned in my work;
I ran aloft with my ship’s crew
And would no duty shirk.
When [[Grendel]] sought our ship to burn
We triumphed in the [[Fight|fight]]
I knew that honour I would earn
Beyond Apulian’s light.
We crossed the ocean unafraid
For [[Asavea]] bound
Where [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]], [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]],
And mazzarine are found.
We bargained for their treasures there
And to my bed at [[Night|night]]
I took a slave-[[Magician|magician]] fair
Beyond Apulian’s light.
Soon home to [[Spiral]] we returned
And found within the year
My parents’ lesson I’d not learned:
I bore a daughter dear.
But though I’ve travelled far since then
And memories burn bright
Her father I’ve not seen again
Beyond Apulian’s light.
