Lyrics and [[Music]] by Alison Krauss/Sting. Filk by Jude or Daisy or both.
You'll walk unscathed through smoke and fire,
No foeman's blade will cut thee down,
No cutlass pUll will mark thy face,
And you will be [[My Ain True Love]],
And you will be my ain true love
And as you walk through death's dark vale,
The dark around you can't prevail,
And those who hunt thee down will fail,
And you will be my ain true love,
And you will be my ain true love.
Asleep inside the dragon's mouth,
[[The Captain]] cries, "Here comes the rout,"
They'll seek to find me north and south,
I've gone to find my ain true love.
The field is cut and bleeds to red,
The arrows fly around my head,
Until the Grimnir counts me dead,
I've gone to find my ain true love,
I've gone to find My Ain True Love.
