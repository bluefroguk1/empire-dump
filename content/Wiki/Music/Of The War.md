A story song by Salviana of Endsmeet.
I once knew a brave man who went to [[War]],
Against the rhino and the orcs,
And with him went a thousand more,
And on that day they sang.
Of all of us who'll die today,
Who will remember us anyway,
For they'd prefer the tales of gore,
And the stranger stories [[Of The War]].
They Mustered under banners tall,
A seasoned warrior one and all,
But in them was a lad so small,
And on that day he sang.
Of all of you who'll die today,
Who will remember you anyway,
For they'd prefer the tales of gore,
And the stranger stories Of The of the war.
The enemies came as quite a force,
Their weapons drawn those screaming orcs,
And from the back they heard a voice,
As a wizened WarWarmage sang.
Of all of us who'll die today,
Who will remember us anyway,
For they'd prefer the tales of gore,
And the stranger stories of the war.
The rhino came right through the trees,
A monstrous creature for all to see,
And there soon after it came to be,
That many a warrior sank.
I sunk my spear into its head.
And I my sword right through its chest.
My axe it cut off all four legs...
And then a [[General]] sang.
Don't fret.
For all of those who've died today,
They'll be remembered don't you say,
For this has been a tale of gore,
And a stranger story Of The of the war!
