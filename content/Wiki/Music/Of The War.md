A story song by Salviana of Endsmeet.
I once knew a brave man who went to [[War|war]],
Against the rhino and the orcs,
And with him went a thousand more,
And on that [[Day|day]] they sang.
Of all of us who'll die today,
Who [[Will|will]] remember us anyway,
For they'd prefer the tales of gore,
And the stranger stories [[Of The War|of the war]].
They mustered under banners tall,
A seasoned warrior one and all,
But in them was a lad so small,
And on that day he sang.
Of all of you who'll die today,
Who [[Will|will]] remember you anyway,
For they'd prefer the tales of gore,
And the stranger stories [[Of The War|of the war]].
The enemies came as quite a force,
Their weapons drawn those screaming orcs,
And from the back they heard a voice,
As a wizened [[Warmage|warmage]] sang.
Of all of us who'll die today,
Who will remember us anyway,
For they'd prefer the tales of gore,
And the stranger stories of the [[War|war]].
The rhino came right through the trees,
A monstrous creature for all to see,
And there soon after it came to be,
That many a warrior sank.
I sunk my spear into its head.
And I my sword right through its chest.
My axe it cut off all four legs...
And then a [[General|general]] sang.
Don't fret.
For all of those who've died today,
They'll be remembered don't you say,
For this has been a tale of gore,
And a stranger story of the war!
