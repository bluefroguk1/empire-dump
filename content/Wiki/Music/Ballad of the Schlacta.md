To the tune of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-TVk-RG8cw Katusha]. Lyrics by David Holley.
Once, in [[Karsk]], I came across a meadhall
Mead, they served, just one Ring for a pint
“We’ll drink here”, oh, I called out to my cousins
“Sun’s gone down, we’ll drink right through the night”
Dawnish lads, were sat around a table
Gleaming armour, ready for a [[Fight]]
“Drinks for them”, oh, I called out to the barkeep
“Maybe they’ll drink with us through the night”
Pissed, we got, a Throne had passed our pockets
Dawnish lads, just pissed their pretty tights
“Had too much”, oh, I called out to the tavern
“Only schlacta drink right through the night”
One got up, and waved his dagger at me
“You!” he said, “I [[Challenge]] to a fight”
Thrown outside, oh, he landed in a snowdrift
With some luck, he’ll make it through the night
Mead we had, and mead we kept on drinking
‘Til outside, did glow the morning light
Drink, drink, drink, til [[Varushka]]’s day is dawning
Time to leave, we’ve made it through the night.
