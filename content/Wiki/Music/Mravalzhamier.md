Title: Mravalzhamier
---
Some of these songs might seem unattainbly difficult on a first listen because of all the crunchy harmonies. Don't panic, concentrate on the tune and don't worry about the harmony, once separated the lines aren't all that hard! They can be sung by both men and women in close or wide harmony, change the key to suit yourself.
