### Day Song
Stitching and spinning
Carding and weaving
From light of morning
On till the evening
Forge fires are [[Burning]]
Bellows are blowing
Mill-wheel is turning
Work never slowing
### Night Song
When the dark is falling
When the sun is setting low
When the evening skies are burning
Leave them all and dance with me
When the evening skies are burning
Leave them all and dance with me
Listen to me calling
Now the moonlight's on the snow
When the midnight stars are turning
Leave them all and dance with me
When the midnight stars are turning
Leave them all and dance with me
