This is an arrangement of G.F. Handel's Air from the Water [[Music]] Suite No. 1. It has been arranged for three recorders (two descants and a tenor) but can be played by any instruments in C. There is a version of the bass line in both treble and bass clef, so you only need to play one of the bottom two lines. There is also chords above the [[Music|music]], but these are less desirable and should be omitted if two or three of the parts are available. 
The pdf of this arrangement can be found [[http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/f/f3/Wedding Air.pdf here]]. 
You can listen to it on YouTube [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-rhoxQTLS4 here]].
