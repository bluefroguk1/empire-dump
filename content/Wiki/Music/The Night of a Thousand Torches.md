[[The Night of a Thousand Torches]]
Written and [https://soundcloud.com/salvatore-galletti/the-night-of-a-thousand recorded] by Chris Robins Kennish for the Compagnia di Rossi for the Autumn Equinox, 377.
When torchlight flickers on your skin
With a thousand eyes upon you
Does it tell of virtue or sin
Darling what am I to do?
The night of a thousand torches
They came for them in they’re beds
The night of a thousand torches
So cold they wished they were dead
To clear the city it is their way
Into winters depth they are cast
Any they find whose skin is stained
The time to hide is past
The night of a thousand torches
They came for us in our beds
The night of a thousand torches
So cold we wished we were dead
Proud red stag upon your skin
A sign of your disgrace
Can’t keep them out, so I let them in
Tears stream down my face
The Night of a Thousand Torches
They came for you in our bed
The Night of a Thousand Torches
So cold I wished you were dead
You’ve gone into the winter night
And I will sleep no more
I only tried to do what was right
I cast you out of my door
The night of a thousand torches
Wish they’d come for me in my bed
The Night of a Thousand Torches
So cold, I wish I were dead
