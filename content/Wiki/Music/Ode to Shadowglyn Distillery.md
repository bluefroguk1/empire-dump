Verse 1
Well, I've travelled the land,
While I held in my hand.
A dram of the finest whisky.
For I'd purchased a cask,
As my striding went past,
the Shadowglyn Distillery.
In all of the empire,
There's nothing compares,
No Astolat brandy,
Nor Freeborn liquor,
To a single malt served neat.
To this connoisseur,
The greatest of whiskies is found...
Chorus
In Shadowglyn,
All your friends will be there,
In Shadowglyn,
Drinking amber nectar.
In Shadowglyn.
When you sip it,
You'll lighten your spirit.
And sing while you're getting them in,
In Shadowglyn.
Verse 2
All my wandering days,
On the trods far away,
'twas a tipple of whisky my prize.
When I emptied my stock,
I returned, but with shock!
For the heavenly taste was denied!
For my friends were enslaved,
And many were dead.
The buildings burnt down.
The grain pulled from their beds.
But worse, the damn orcs had shat in the kegs!
No whisky at all could be found...
Chorus
Bridge
For long lonely years,
I drank deep of my tears,
And all shots were like ash in my mouth.
'till the day I did learn,
That a man they call Wern,
Was the saviour – yes the saviour – of my malt...
Verse 3
So I'm leaving today,
And I'm planning to stay,
In a hall where I'll never be barred.
Be sure, I'll defend her,
And never surrender,
My bottle, my dear uisge beatha.
For some walk the trods,
And some ward vallorn,
Some fight Drujan orcs,
And others Jotun,
But my dance led me here,
And I've got a home,
Where whisky shall always be found...
And downed!
Chorus
Coda
All your friends will be there,
In Shadowglyn,
Drinking amber nectar.
In Shadowglyn.
When you sip it,
You'll lighten your spirit.
And sing while you're getting them in,
In Shadowglyn.
