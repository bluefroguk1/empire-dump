[[Speak of Your Love|Speak of your Love]]
''By Nicassia of Phoenix Reach''
O [[Urizen]] of lofty [[Spires]]
Is not averse to passion’s fires
But if you’re always reading books
None [[Will|will]] see your meaningful looks,
O [[Urizen]] of snow-capped peaks
Where one thinks well before one speaks 
If one does not speak at all
It’s no surprise your love won’t fall.
So [[Speak of Your Love|speak of your love]],
Speak of it truly,
[[Speak of Your Love|Speak of your love]]
Before you go;
[[Speak of Your Love|Speak of your love]]
This morning, this evening,
[[Speak of Your Love|Speak of your love]]
Or they’ll never know.
O [[Wintermark]] of ice and snow,
Where brave and bold a-hunting go,
If you stay tight within your furs
You’ll be left to fret and [[Curse|curse]].
O [[Varushka]], of the wood and wild,
Huddled snug around your fires,
To keep your heart locked up so tight,
May leave you lonely in the [[Night|night]],
So speak…
O Orcish tribes, with eyes aflame,
Fighting for [[The Empire|the Empire]]’s name,
Who very frankly speak your mind – 
Be sure you treat your love in kind,
O [[Navarr]] of the [[Forest|forest]] [[Trod]],
Nimble scouts all leather-shod,
If you hide too long amid the trees
There’ll be none left for you to please.
So speak...
O [[Highguard]], of the tall, proud towers,
Who’d walk around in mail for hours,
Done up so tightly in that skin,
How do you let a lover in?
O [[Freeborn]] of the ship and sail,
Who threw aside their cousins’ veils,
Take care, don’t set your price too high
Or lovers, too, [[Will|will]] surely fly!
So speak… 
O Marchers of the bill and block,
Such energetic, ruddy stock,
But with so much upon your plate
[[Will]] you speak before it’s too late?
O [[Dawn]] of ballad and fine verse,
Perhaps to speak too much is worse,
For giving them too much to heed
You might not make it to the deed!
So speak…
O Leaguers, with your smashing tights
And cities more alive at night,
To spend your evenings counting coins
[[Will]] do no service to your loins!
O people, please, hear my  request,
Though much of this is done in jest,
If you’d not be alone this night
Communicate to set it right.
So speak…
