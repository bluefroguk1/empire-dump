Someone's Standing at the edge, as the chapter Gathers round
all: Who is this man Guarding us on Sacred ground
Quietly he provides And protects  Without a sound
all: And to his Purpose our oaths are Honour bound
With stealth And strength He guards unnoticed On the edge
Providing for And keeping safe Our kith and kin
No fanfare, No noise, Does he make
Someone's Standing at the edge, as the chapter Gathers round
all: Who is this man Guarding us on Sacred ground
Quietly he provides And protects  Without a sound
all: The Drowned Man Guardian of our land
Outside Looking in, And inside Looking out
No one knows The subtle things He does
Yet through his work We're all safe And secure
Someone's Standing at the edge, As the chapter Gathers round
all: Who is this man Guarding us on Sacred ground
Quietly he provides And protects Without a sound
all: And to his Purpose our oaths are Honour bound
Freely given Freely received He created the Drowned man's creed
And now in turn  We honour our Drowned Man
Who guards So well the silence of our tide
Somewhere Right now a Drowned man's Standing near
Whether here At home or Some far off Land
He keeps safe All we hold dear
Yes, somewhere Right now,  a Drowned Man's Standing near
Someone's Standing at the edge, As the chapter Gathers round
all: Who is this man Guarding us on Sacred ground
Quietly he provides And protects Without a sound
The Drowned Man Guardian of our Sacred space
all: The Drowned Man Guardian of our land
all: The Drowned Man Paragon of our creed
