His banner's not [[Mine]], not mine, not mine
His banner's not mine, bonny though the colours be
I saw him in the market square
In the sunlight standing there
A bonny boy with flaxen hair 
And oh his smile is dear to me
Next day I buckled on my shield
And lifted up my sword to wield 
Who should I see there on the field
But the lad that was so dear to me...
His banner's not mine, not Mine, not Mine
His banner's not Mine, bonny though the colours be
My love he is a Marcher born
And to a Dawnish [[Earl]] I'm sworn
And oh, in two my heart is torn
But still his banner's dear to me
Come [[Dawn]] the army will depart
And many months we'll be apart
I'll hold forever in my heart
His banner that's so dear to me
His banner's not mine, not mine, not mine
His banner's not mine, bonny though the colours be
He's off defending distant shores
And I must [[Fight]] another [[War]]
Perhaps I never shall see more
His banner that's so dear to me,
But maybe there will come a time
When our two nations stand combined
He'll raise his banner next to mine
The banner that's so dear to me
His banner's not mine, not mine, not mine
His banner's not mine, bonny though the colours be
