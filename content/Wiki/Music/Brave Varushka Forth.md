A cry that echoes in the valleys
Heed the call from beyond the sea
Though the baying wolves are gath'ring
Now must start the first journey
Chorus: Strangest lands await us
Brave Brave Varushka Forth
Set your course before the winter
Keep a watch upon the North
Sons and daughters of The Mountains
Chase the dream, abate your fear
Brave the shadows, [[Fight]] the darkness
Those you leave will shed no tear
Travel fast, the Wardens guarding
Step not first among the trees
Bring us back your tales of gladness
Songs of life to stir the bees
Sons and daughters of the mountains
Forge your name upon the field
Though some may fall beneath the shadow
With Shattered sword and splintered shield
Those you leave will call you homeward
Those you leave will Sing your names
We will keep the hearth fire [[Burning]]
Bravest [[Heroes]], seek your fame.
