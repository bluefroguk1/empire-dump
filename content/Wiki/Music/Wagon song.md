''Drink up your tankards and drain your flagon''
''Morning has come and it's time to pack the wagon''
Heading south, for satins soft and flowing
Silks of gold, all blazing like the sun
Buy and sell, and ever onWard going
Turning west when all our trade is done
''Drink up your tankards and drain your flagon''
''Morning has come and it's time to pack the wagon''
To the West, the river and the city
Following the bright sun as it sets
Singers sweet and dancers oh so pretty -
Leave with smiles and never with regrets 
''Drink up your tankards and drain your flagon''
''Morning has come and it's time to pack the wagon''
Now the north, The Mountains rise to meet me
Ambergris and hardwoods in great store
Cider spiced to satisfy completely
Then we'll turn back to the road once more.
''Drink up your tankards and drain your flagon''
''Morning has come and it's time to pack the wagon''
Turning east, the bay is there before me
In the distance I can see the sea
On the road, a new adventure story
Nothing but a traveller's life for me
''Drink up your tankards and drain your flagon''
''Morning has come and it's time to pack the wagon''
