Remember those who have come before you
And be inSpired by their deads
Praise them with song and story
And of their warnings you must take heed
Skjaldir! Hold our line together
Raoljost! Smash our enemy apart
Ulvenwar drive our foe before us
Ulfur! Drive the dagger in their hearts
Endure all of your trials like Skaldi
By frost and foe he was never bowed
In spite of storms that may howl before you
keep standing firm as you sing this aloud
Skjaldir!...
Observe the foe as you search for [[Weakness]]
Lie in wait like the the patient wolves
Inspired by Ulfur the greatest hunter
Go for the heart and make them fall
Skjaldir!...
As you watch all the ghodi Healing
Just remember who taught the craft
Raoljost wisest amongst us
And his knowledge will ever last
Skjaldir!....
Above all be as strong as Ulven
Clad in fur she could fell them all
Bring the axe down upon the foeman
Listen close now the ancestors call
Skjadir!...
