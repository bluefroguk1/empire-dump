----------
For many nights I tossed and turned
And paced the chilly floor
No satisfaction could I find
I vowed I'd toss no more
I sought to fill my empty void
With a man from every nation
For better ways to spend my days
Than endless ma...
...thematics
My eye fell on a Dawnish knight
Who looked so big and strong
He sang me songs of courtly love
At my window all night long
He took me in The Gardens fair
He rode me to the hunt
But his sword, alas, was much to small
To fill my empty...
...scabbard
To the [[Wintermark]] I went
To find a man so Warm
He gave me furs and skins to feel
And stroked me till the [[Dawn]]
Sagas he did tell to me, oh, how the [[Glory]] lingers
But his tongue was frozen hard
Too cold for...
...telling riddles
The marcher folk, so it's been spoke
Are strong in leg and back
I found a lovely Farmer's boy
With ripe plums in his sack
His mighty hoe, it swung so low
Milk white was his complexion
The problem, see, was just that he
Could not get an...
...arrangement
A Brass Coast bed, so it's been said
Is fUll of fire and passion
So a freeborn man became my plan
To get my sausage ration
I searched the nation up and down
To the city of Siroc
But every single man I found
Had such a tiny...
...purse
I went one day across the bay
To find a merchant wealthy
I tracked one down in [[Holberg]] town
Whose purse was full and Healthy
In wine and song we dallied long
In games of chance and luck
But when I said "it's time for bed"
He was too drunk to...
...get his boots off
I found a lusty woodcutter
In the cold Varushkan snow
He kissed me in The Mountains high
And also down below
In his strong arms I plied my charms
While hail and sleet fell thick
But no [[Magic]] spell that I could tell
Could raise his flaccid...
...banner
I found among the [[Navarr]] Tribes,
A man with [[Painted]] skin
So proud and bold, his hair like gold
I thought my luck was in
All night and day we naked lay
With not a stitch between us
But I found out you'd need a scout
To find his tiny...
...tent
I had a date with a wizard great
In a lonely mountain tower
I had great hopes that neath his robes
Was a wand of fearsome power
But his mighty staff just made me laugh
Because for all the lore he knew,
There's no book in his library
To teach him how to...
...entertain
When no one could fulfil my needs
In any Empire nation
I even went to see the orcs
Such was my desperation
They thought me mad, but sent my way
A warrior of high ranking
His weapon was too big to fit
So I was back to...
...embroidery
With a heart like stone I wandered home
And found my Chaptermaster
I told him how my PilgriPilgrimage 
Had ended in disaster
His eyes grew bright - we cuddled tight
Until our strength was flagging
No more I'll roam, for here at home
I get a decent...
...education.
