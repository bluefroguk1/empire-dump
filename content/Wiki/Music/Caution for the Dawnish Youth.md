Verse 1
How can you pretend to know of violence,
Sitting, reading fairy tales of [[War]]?
Tell me what's the worst that you can fear! A papercut?
My Dawnish friend, our wounds are deeper still.
Chorus
Ai! Ai-ee-eh! Ai-ee-eh!
Ai! Ai-ee-eh! Ai-ee-eh!
Verse 2
The borders of [[The Empire]] are too fragile,
To let an enemy get half-a-chance.
Kill them where you can,
Use everything you have to hand.
Noble grace will send you to your grave.
Chorus
Verse 3 with bridge.
The [[Striding]] walks the [[Trod]] to save our homeland.
The [[Steading]] guards the wood 'till they return.
You would blindly wander in alone?
You cannot see.
You cannot hear.
There in the deep...
[[The Vallorn]] lie....
They never sleep...
They're waiting...
Chorus
Verse 4
On the road, the paths we tread are endless.
The weariness will wear you to the bone.
The enemy will wait for you to stumble.
With [[Vigilance]], your only coat of steel.
Chorus
