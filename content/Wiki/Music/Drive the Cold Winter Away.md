---
These extremely Marcher verses are taken from a much longer traditional English song " A Pleasant Countrey New Ditty: Merrily Shewing How to [[Drive the Cold Winter Away]]", from the Roxburghe Ballads,  a collection of 17th century songs. The full version is available [http://www.lukehistory.com/ballads/drvcold.html here]  Kathryn has added in a simple chorus, as Marchers do love a good singalong!
A recording of this song can be found [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/DriveTheColdWinter.mp3 here] and sheet [[Music|music]] is available [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/DriveTheColdWinter.pdf here]
This time of the year is spent in good cheer,
And neighbours together do meet 
To sit by the fire, with friendly desire, 
Each other in love to greet; 
Old grudges forgot are put in the pot, 
All sorrows aside they lay; 
The old and the young doth carol this song 
To [[Drive the Cold Winter Away|drive the cold winter away]].
Chorus: 
To [[Drive the Cold Winter Away|drive the cold winter away]], away 
To drive the cold winter away 
The old and the young doth carol this song 
To drive the cold winter away.
To mask and to mum kind neighbours will come 
With wassails of hot brown ale, 
To drink and carouse to all in the house 
As merry as bucks in the dale; 
Where cake, bread, and cheese is brought for your fees 
To make you the longer stay; 
At the fire to warm 'twill do you no harm, 
To drive the cold winter away.
Chorus
When white-bearded frost hath threatened its worst, 
And fallen from branch and briar, 
Then time away calls from husbandry halls 
And from the good countryman's fire, 
Together to go, to plough and to sow 
To get us both food and array, 
And thus will content the time we have spent 
To drive the cold winter away
Chorus
