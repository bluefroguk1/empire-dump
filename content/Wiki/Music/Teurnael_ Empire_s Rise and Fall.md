It came writhing and creeping through the crumbling stone
It brutalised and devastated, everything ripped to shreds
Twisted, knotted and broken
Terunael, Terunael
Empires rise and fall
Heralds hear our call
Ternuael
It was monstrous and deadly driving them out of their homes
[[Navarr]] and [[Thorn]], laid down their lives
Trods created just to weaken The [[The Vallorn]]
Travelling far to defeat it
Strike it down, together [[Fight]] as one
[[Magic]] unwound, vines they grew, crushing all they found
Terunael, Terunael
