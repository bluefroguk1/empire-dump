Tune by Dave Lowry, lyrics by Dave Lowry and Claire Sheridan.
A meditation on [[The Key|the key]] concepts underpinning the [[Urizen]].
[[The Three Pillars]]
''Ioseph & Nicassia of Phoenix Reach''
We shape and we perceive,
We hide and grow.
The [[Realms]] move and concede;
We move the flow.
A word can break a wall,
A [[Rune|rune]] a soul:
We'll know and name them all,
Make this world whole.
Chorus:
These three pillars hold our nation,
Stronger than mountains, clearer than a stream,
Virtue carried to our horizon,
These three pillars.
We document and own,
We learn and grow:
All knowledge can be known;
It's ours to know.
We reason and apply,
We use with care,
Our [[Spires]] touch the sky,
Destinyâ€™s there.
(Chorus)
So ever on we strive,
Ambitions grow.
Through Poise we show our [[Pride]]
In what we know.
Our work [[Will|will]] strengthen all;
We'll pass it on.
Others [[Will|will]] heed the call
After we've [[Gone|gone]].
(Chorus)
