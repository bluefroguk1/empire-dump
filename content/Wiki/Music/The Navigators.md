[[The Navigators]] lyrics by Jude Reid
To the tune of Sacred Harp 121 (Florence), [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZnUyJvIulc recording and score on youtube], tune is the middle line.
-------------
So many times the stars have turned
Since in those days of yore
The Navigators first set sail
To seek a distant shore
Through chilling winds and beating rains,
Through waters deep and cold,
Their enemies surrounding them,
Take [[Courage]] and be bold.
Though storms and hurricanes arise,
And foes be all around,
And foul Eternals may appear,
To proFane the sacred ground.
Dark nights and clouds and gloomy fear â€”
And dragons fearsome roar 
We'll hold as fast as heros of old
Who sailed for [[Highguard]]'s shore.
