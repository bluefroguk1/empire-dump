Oh - - - - -, wherever you go - - - -
You leave [[Footprints|footprints]] in the snow - - - 
On the battlefield, midst the hue and cry - - - 
You looked death in the face and were not afraid to die - - - 
In the [[The Labyrinth of Ages and the Paragons and Exemplars|Labyrinth]], you know where to turn - - - 
[[Footprints]] that you made in life will guide your return. - - -
Oh - - - - -, wherever you go - - - -
You leave [[Footprints|footprints]] in the snow - - -
