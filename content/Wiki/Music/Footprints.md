Oh - - - - -, wherever you go - - - -
You leave [[Footprints|footprints]] in the snow - - - 
On [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], midst the hue and cry - - - 
You looked death in the face and were not afraid to die - - - 
In the Labyrinth, you know where to turn - - - 
Footprints that you made in life [[Will|will]] [[Guide|guide]] your return. - - -
Oh - - - - -, wherever you go - - - -
You leave footprints in the snow - - -
