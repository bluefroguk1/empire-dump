Title: Dawnish War Song
aliases:
- Dawnish_War_Song
---
This song works well if the singers do one verse in unison, perhaps with tabor or drum, then musicians on instruments like shawms, fifes and war-drums join to repeat the tune.
The tune is the first theme of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcmpBCXOgVI&sns=em Dead Can Dance's saltarello], but you could play instrumentals with any of their variations or make up some of your own. 
A pdf of the lyrics and sheet [[Music|music]] can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/d/d4/Dawnish_War_Song.pdf here].
Sword and shield and armour bright
Yeoman and witch and knight
Now we march and now we fight
Now have no fear, fight with me for glory here
Instrumental
Trumpet call and battle cry
Raise the standard up on high
Victory or else we die
Now have no fear, fight with meÂ for glory here
Instrumental 
Take your weapons in your hand
Shield to shoulder now we stand
Never yield a foot of land
Now have no fear, fight with me for glory here
Instrumental
