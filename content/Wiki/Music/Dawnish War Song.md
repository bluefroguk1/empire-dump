This song works well if the singers do one verse in unison, perhaps with tabor or drum, then musicians on instruments like shawms, fifes and [[War|war]]-drums join to repeat the tune.
The tune is the first theme of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcmpBCXOgVI&sns=em Dead Can Dance's saltarello], but you could play instrumentals with any of their variations or make up some of your own. 
A pdf of the lyrics and sheet [[Music|music]] can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/d/d4/[[Dawnish War Song|Dawnish_War_Song]].pdf here].
Sword and shield and armour bright
Yeoman and [[Witch|witch]] and knight
Now we march and now we [[Fight|fight]]
Now have no fear, [[Fight|fight]] with me for [[Glory|glory]] here
Instrumental
Trumpet call and battle cry
Raise the standard up on high
Victory or else we die
Now have no fear, fight with meÂ for [[Glory|glory]] here
Instrumental 
Take your weapons in your hand
Shield to shoulder now we stand
Never yield a foot of land
Now have no fear, fight with me for glory here
Instrumental
