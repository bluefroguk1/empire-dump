Reuben's Brethren or The Mercenary's Creed
Robert E. Howard
[https://soundcloud.com/salvatore-galletti/reubens-brethren Recording]
Drain the cup while the ale is bright,
Brief truce to remorse and sorrow!
I drink the health of my friend tonight-
I may cut his throat tomorrow.
Tonight I fling a curse in the cup
For the foe whose lines we sundered-
I may ride in his ranks when the sun comes up
And die for the flag I plundered.
Kisses I drank in the blaze of noon,
At eve may be bitter as scorning-
And I go in the light of a mocking moon
To the woman I cursed this morning.
For deep in my soul the old ways brood-
And I come of a restless breed-
And my heart is blown in each drifting mood
As clouds blow over the mead.
