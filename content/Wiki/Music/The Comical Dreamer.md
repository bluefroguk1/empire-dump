[[The Comical Dreamer]]
''Traditional Urizeni
Last night a dream came into my head
Thou wert a fine white loaf of bread.
Then if may butter I could be
How I would spread
Oh! How I would spread myself on thee.
This morning too my thoughts ran hard
That you were made a cool tankard
Then could I but a lemon be
How I would squeeze
Oh! how I would squeeze my juice in thee.
Lately, when fancy too did roam,
Thou wert my dear, a honeycomb;
And had I been a pretty bee
How I would suck
Oh! How I would creep, creep into thee.
A vision, too, I had of old
That thou a mortar wert of gold
Then could I but the pestle be
How I would pound
Oh! How I would pound my spice in thee.	
Once joy in dreaming did I meet,
Thou wert a bowl of brandy sweet.
Oh! could I then the ladle be
How would I pour
O! how would I pour out joys from thee.
Another time by charm divine
I dreamt thou wert an orchard fine
Then could I but thy farmer be
How I would plant
Oh! how I would plant my fruit in thee.
Soon after whims came in my pate
Thou wert a pot of chocolate
And could I but the rowler be
How would I rub
Oh! how would I twirl and froth up thee.
But since all dreams are vain my dear
Let now some solid joy appear
My soul still thine is prov'd to be
Let body now
Oh! let body now with soul agree.
