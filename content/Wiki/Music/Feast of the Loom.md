Song for the [[Feast of the Loom]]
Chorus:
''Go light [[The Lantern|the lantern]] at your door,''
''to honour those who've [[Gone|gone]] before''
''The worlds that part us now are near,''
''the Loom [[Will|will]] weave another year''
The westering sun is pale and wan,
the days are dark, the nights are long,
A chill is in the evening air,
and wind stirs in the branches bare
(Chorus)
Sweep out the hearth and clear the grate
and bid folk welcome at your [[Gate|gate]],
when darkness comes we'll bar [[The Door|the door]],
and feast till we can eat no more
(Chorus)
We'll tell the tales of [[Heroes|heroes]] brave,
and those we loved lost to the grave
The hearth fires that tonight we burn,
[[Will|will]] light [[The Way|the Way]] for their return,
(Chorus)
Now round the bonfires lightly tread
To welcome in the year ahead
The seasons turn through frost and dew
Until the year is born anew
