Song for the Feast of the Loom
Chorus:
''Go light [[The Lantern]] at your door,''
''to honour those who've gone before''
''The worlds that part us now are near,''
''the Loom will weave another year''
The westering sun is pale and wan,
the days are dark, the nights are long,
A chill is in the evening air,
and wind stirs in the branches bare
(Chorus)
Sweep out the hearth and clear the grate
and bid folk welcome at your gate,
when darkness comes we'll bar [[The Door]],
and feast till we can eat no more
(Chorus)
We'll tell the tales of [[Heroes]] brave,
and those we loved lost to the grave
The hearth fires that tonight we burn,
will light [[The Way]] for their return,
(Chorus)
Now round the bonfires lightly tread
To welcome in the year ahead
The seasons turn through frost and dew
Until the year is born anew
