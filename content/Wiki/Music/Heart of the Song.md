Song by Peter Scrowther - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYY32ziq-Ag
[[Chords]] in First Verse and Chorus.
Chorus 1
O come all you weary trav'llers, [G D G]
Let us take time from our journey, [Em C G]
A few moments long, [Em C G]
'To delay all tribulation [G D G]
In the cooling breath of silence, [Em C G]
At the [[Heart of the Song]]. [G D C]
The heart of the song. [C D G]
Verse 1
As we journey through mountains, [Em G]
in pursuit of our dream, [C]
How we hurry to capture the prize! [Am G C]
Catching glimpses of valleys, [Em G]
with tumbling streams. [C] 
Let us stop some day when we have time. [Am G C]
Chorus 2
O come all you weary trav'llers,
Let us take time from our journey,
A few moments long,
If we lose sight of each other,
I will meet in the silence,
At the heart of the song.
The heart of the song
Verse 2
All those questions and mysteries,
That discomfort your mind,
O what wouldn't you give for one sign!
There may not be the answers,
You've been hoping to find,
But the questions will glimmer and shine! 
Chorus 3
Like the starry eyes of lovers,
And the moon beneath the water,
When the [[Magic]] is strong,
If we lose sight of each other,
I will meet in the silence,
At the heart of the song.
The heart of the song
