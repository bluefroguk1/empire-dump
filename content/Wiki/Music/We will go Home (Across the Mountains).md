New lyrics by Michael Barley
Verse 1
Land of bear and land of eagle.
Land that gave us birth and blessing.
Land that called us ever homewards.
We will go home across the mountains.
Chorus
We will go home, we will go home,
We will go home across the mountains.
We will go home, we will go home,
We will go home across the mountains.
Verse 2
Land of Thorn, and land of Navarr.
Land that gave us hope and memories.
Hear our singing, hear our longing.
We will go home across the mountains.
Chorus
Verse 3
Land of sun and land of moonlight.
Land that gave us joy and sorrow.
Land that gave us love and laughter.
We will go home across the mountains.
Chorus
Verse 4
Land of our fathers. Land of our mothers.
Land of spear, of blade, of bow.
Thorns are singing in the darkness.
We will go home across the mountains.
Chorus
