New lyrics by Michael Barley
Verse 1
Land of bear and land of eagle.
Land that gave us birth and blessing.
Land that called us ever homewards.
We [[Will|will]] go home across the mountains.
Chorus
We [[Will|will]] go home, we [[Will|will]] go home,
We [[Will|will]] go home across the mountains.
We [[Will|will]] go home, we will go home,
We will go home across the mountains.
Verse 2
Land of [[Thorn]], and land of [[Navarr]].
Land that gave us hope and memories.
Hear our singing, hear our longing.
We will go home across the mountains.
Chorus
Verse 3
Land of sun and land of moonlight.
Land that gave us joy and sorrow.
Land that gave us love and laughter.
We will go home across the mountains.
Chorus
Verse 4
Land of our fathers. Land of our mothers.
Land of spear, of blade, of bow.
Thorns are singing in the darkness.
We will go home across the mountains.
Chorus
