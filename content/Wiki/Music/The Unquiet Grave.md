How pleasant is the wind tonight
I feel some drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And far off he lies slain
As I lay dreaming in my bed
I heard my true love speak
My bones are lying far from home
And there I cannot sleep
When all the fighting it was done 
They laid me with the dead
To  rest uneasy in the poor soil, 
Cold in my stony bed
Oh come to me my dearest dear
Come swiftly and alone
For you alone my soul can save
For you can bring me home
For twelve long months the land I roamed
Until the field I found
Where they had laid my true love's bones
In stony barren ground
I had no box to bear his bones
No coffer made of stone
But linen for a winding sheet
To carry my love home
Oh, pleasant is the wind tonight
And sound my sleep shall be
But my love sleeps the best of all
Beneath the apple trees
