There are various versions of this song that are suitable for several nations. 
This first acapella version ([http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XAJSO35MYC8 [[Daddy Fox]], Muldoon' Picnic]) would be great for [[The Marches]] or [[Dawn]] whereas this version ([http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_zCZ33FQE90 The Fox, Nickel Creek]) would be more suited to [[The League]] or [[The Brass Coast]] perhaps.
A pdf of [[The Marches|the Marches]]/[[Dawn]] version can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/6/6c/[[Daddy Fox|Daddy_Fox]].pdf here]. 
---------
[[Marches]]/Dawn version
1. [[Daddy Fox]] went out on a chilly [[Night|night]]
With a ring tong dilly dong kyro me
Prayed for the moon to give him light
With a ring tong dilly dong kyro me.
''Cho: Hey fa la lee, fa la la, fa la lero, Hey fa la lero lero lee''
''Up jumped John, ringin' on his bell, With a ring tong dilly dong kyro me.''
2. He ran till he came to a cozy pen
The ducks and geese were kept therein
3. He grabbed the grey goose by the neck
Up with the little ones over his back
4. Old Mother Flipper-Flopper jumped out of bed
Out of the window she stuck her little head
5. John ran up to the top of the hill
Blew his little horn both loud and shrill
6. The fox he ran to his cozy den
There were the little ones 8, 9, 10
7. Then the fox and his wife without any strife
Cut up the goose with a carving knife
[[League]]/Brass Coast version
The Fox went out on a chilly night 
He prayed for the moon to give him light 
For he had many a mile to go that night 
Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o 
He had many a mile to go that night 
Before he reached the town-o 
He ran till he came to the farmers pen 
The ducks and the geese were kept therein 
He said a couple of you are gonna grease my chin 
Before I leave this town-o, town-o, town-o 
A couple of you are gonna grease my chin 
Before I leave this town-o 
He grabbed the great goose by the neck 
He threw a duck across his back 
And he didn't mind the quack, quack 
And the legs all danglin' down-o, down-o, down-o 
He didn't mind the quack, quack 
And the legs all danglin' down-o 
Well the old gray Woman jumped out of bed 
Out of the window she popped her head 
Cryin' John, John the great goose is [[Gone|gone]] 
The Fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o 
John, John the great goose is gone 
And the Fox is on the town-o 
He ran till he came to his nice warm den 
And there were the little ones 8, 9, 10 
Sayin' Daddy, Daddy better go back again 
It must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o 
Daddy, Daddy go back again 
For it must be a mighty fine town-o 
The Fox and his Wife, without any strife 
They cut up the goose with a fork and a knife 
And they never had such a supper in their life 
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o, bones-o, bones-o 
They never had such a supper in their life 
And the little ones chewed on the bones
