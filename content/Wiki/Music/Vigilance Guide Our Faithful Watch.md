Lyrics:
In forests dark and lands forlorn
Was Felix born to clan Yagoda
([[Vigilance Guide Our Faithful Watch|Vigilance guide our faithful watch]])
The touch of Winter in his blood
Would ever test his watchfulness
([[Vigilance Guide Our Faithful Watch|Vigilance guide our faithful watch]])
For years he hunted wickedness
And yet his soul lacked true purpose
([[Vigilance Guide Our Faithful Watch|Vigilance guide our faithful watch]])
In Virtue did he find the way
To Shelomit, his guiding light
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
The Highborn call he did accept
In Casinea he found himself
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
A prosperous touch upon his brow
Would bring his hand to Mount Uphaz
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
Within the mountain omens bright
The skull of Susa he unearthed
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
With horse's courage laid he stones
His Watch to last forever more
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
O Shelomit she lifted him
Till he stood tall as Atuman
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
The Highborn they did heed her call
To Felix pledged their Loyalty
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
His creed did spread among the wise
Inwards they looked and knew themseves
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
To Realms beyond they turned their gaze
And raised their guard Eternalwards
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
From Cuna voyaged peerless minds
The wisdom of recorders sublime
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
Within the mines and battlements
Are forged the virtuous and pure
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
A golden hostel on the mount
Its creed inscribed in black marble
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
The touch of Winter in his blood
Would lead him to the Labyrinth
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
The towers steadfast in his name
His watch to last forever more
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
The towers steadfast in his name
His legacy forever more
(Vigilance guide our faithful watch)
