Come Varushka's sons and daughters 
Arm yourselves for blood and slaughter 
Now the snows turn red with gore 
For Mother [[Mother Varushka]] goes to [[War]] (x2) 
Come my sisters and my brothers 
Like your fathers and your mothers 
Marched to battle years before 
Now Mother Mother Varushka goes to war (x2) 
On to battle in the morning 
Red shall be the new day's Dawning 
Raise the banner high before 
Mother Varushka goes to war (x2)
Now the drums of war are beating 
Onward march and no retreating 
Till we fall to rise no more 
When mother Varushka goes to war (x2)
