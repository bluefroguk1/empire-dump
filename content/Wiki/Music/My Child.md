Words and tune by Dhiamara Coulson. [https://soundcloud.com/thecynicalselfadoration/[[Urizen|urizen]]-lullaby-my-child?in=thecynicalselfadoration/sets/[[Urizen|urizen]] tune]
An [[Urizen]] Lullaby, by Salviana of Endsmeet [[Spire]]
Don't cry [[My Child|my child]]
Don't cry little one
Though the nights are short and the days are long
There shall be stars tomorrow on [[The Mountain|the mountain]] tops
And the light [[Will|will]] fade
And the stars [[Will|will]] shine one.
So smile [[My Child|my child]]
So smile little one
Though the [[Dawn|dawn]] is breaking and the [[Day|day]] has begun 
There shall me laughter, merriment and books to be read
Then when you're all worn out
We'll tuck you in bed
Now sleep [[My Child|my child]]
Now sleep little one
As the starts are back above you and the [[Night|night]] does grow on
So be safe [[My Child|my child]]
Be safe little one
Let the stars [[Guide|guide]] you and your fate carry on
