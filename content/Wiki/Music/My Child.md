Words and tune by Dhiamara Coulson. [https://soundcloud.com/thecynicalselfadoration/[[Urizen]]-lUllaby-my-child?in=thecynicalselfadoration/sets/urizen tune]
An Urizen Lullaby, by Salviana of Endsmeet [[Spire]]
Don't cry [[My Child]]
Don't cry little one
Though the nights are short and the days are long
There shall be stars toMorrow on [[The Mountain]] tops
And the light will fade
And the stars will shine one.
So smile my child
So smile little one
Though the [[Dawn]] is breaking and the day has begun 
There shall me laughter, merriment and books to be read
Then when you're all worn out
We'll tuck you in bed
Now sleep my child
Now sleep little one
As the starts are back above you and the night does grow on
So be safe my child
Be safe little one
Let the stars guide you and your fate carry on
