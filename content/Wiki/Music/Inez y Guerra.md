When I first laid eyes upon her
[[Inez y Guerra]]
[[Golden Sun]] was shining on her
Inez y [[Guerra]]
She was brave and she was daring, Captain of a swift [[Corsair]]
Grace was in her every movement, fiery eyes and flowing hair
With the crew she'd sweat and toil
Inez y Guerra
Every one was true and loyal 
Inez y Guerra
Every word she spoke was treasure, when she smiled it brought me joy
Every soul aboard adored her, first mate down to cabin boy
Though she scorned both shield and armour
Inez y Guerra
When she fought no foe could harm her
Inez y Guerra
If I were a wealthy Captain, with a ship upon the sea
I would sail a golden galleon,'Fair Inez' her name would be
Like a ship upon the ocean 
Inez y Guerra
Beauty in her every motion
Inez y Guerra
With a hold packed fUll oftreasure, home upon the storm I'd ride
I would lay it at her feet if only she would be my bride
Though I never could deserve her-
Inez y Guerra
All my lifelong days I'll serve her 
Inez y Guera
