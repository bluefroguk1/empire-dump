Words by Claire Sheridan, to a traditional tune. 
A song for the Flower Festival, which is held in [[Urizen]] in the [[Spring]]. It is a time for the citizens of [[Urizen]] to comment and receive comment on their Virtues from other Urizeni citizens. It can also be a time for expressing feelings of love or attraction to others, or letting other citizens know that, as busy as one may be in search of [[Arete]], one would like to share that search with someone else. 
[[I will make you brooches]] and flowers for your delight,
Of birdsong at morning and star-shine at [[Night|night]],
I [[Will|will]] make a purpose, fit for you and me,
Of working together, and so all may see.
I hope you [[Will|will]] Prosper, with wealth that you may share,
So yellow’s one flower that I’d have you wear,
With [[Wisdom]] you [[Will|will]] find the path that suits you best,
And so I would place a white bloom upon your breast. 
To take action takes [[Courage]], so I’d deck you out in red, 
And with pink to take [[Pride]] in what’s done and said,
I’d never want a coward to work beside of me, 
I’ll always take [[Pride]] in those I keep close to me.
We should all be Loyal, so I’ll make a bloom of blue,
When those vows are spoken may we keep them true.
I’d have you see the danger before the danger’s here,
For [[Vigilance]] green is the colour we wear. 
The purple of [[Ambition]] I’ll give to drive you on,
May our works remain long after we’re [[Gone|gone]],
Now bound up in ribbons, this gift I give to you, 
Now give me an answer before this song is through.
