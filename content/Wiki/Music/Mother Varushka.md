[[Mother Varushka]] is old as the hills
Her tears fill the streams and her sighs turn the mills
She smiles at our birth and our passing she mourns
But fools and idlers she scorns
Chorus:
[[Varushka]], [[Varushka]], our mother so dear
She laughs and she weeps and her anger we fear
She cradles us closer each [[Day|day]] that we spend
And when we are [[Gone|gone]], still our path she [[Will|will]] tend
[[Mother Varushka]] is wise as can be
She knows what is needed for each thing to be
She melts what she can of her snow-covered shawl
To give us good food and to keep us safe all
Chorus
[[Mother Varushka]] is cunning and brave
A thousand times over, our lives she [[Will|will]] save
Careful and wary, like [[The Spider|the spider]] she spins
And watches and waits for the wolves to fall in
Chorus
Mother [[Varushka]] is loyal and true
She loves all her [[Children|children]], the old and the new
However she struggles neath [[Winter]]'s cruel yoke
She still [[Will|will]] defend her own brave Varushkan folk.
Chorus
