Not long, not long, my father said
Not long will you be ours
[[The Sovereign|The sovereign]] knows all too well
Which are the fairest flowers
The priest was all too worldy
Though he prayed and rang his bell
[[The Sovereign|The sovereign]] three candles lit
The priest said it was well
Her arms were all too feeble
Though she claimed to love me so
[[The Sovereign|The sovereign]] stretched out its hand
She sighed and let me go
This land is all too shallow
It is [[Painted|painted]] on the sky
And it trembles like the wind-shook rain
When the sovereign rides by
For ever and for always
I pray remember me
Upon the moors, beneath the stars
In the sovereign's company
