Not long, not long, my father said
Not long will you be ours
[[The Sovereign]] knows [[All too well]]
Which are the fairest flowers
The priest was all too worldy
Though he prayed and rang his bell
The sovereign three candles lit
The priest said it was well
Her arms were all too feeble
Though she claimed to love me so
The sovereign stretched out its hand
She sighed and let me go
This land is all too sHallow
It is [[Painted]] on the sky
And it trembles like the wind-shook rain
When the sovereign rides by
For ever and for always
I pray remember me
Upon the moors, beneath the stars
In the sovereign's company
