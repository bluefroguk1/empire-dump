Following the of the 380YE [[Autumn]] Equniox, and the [[Events|events]] that preceded it, Lady Tamain Sepulchre composed this song to assist in pushing back against the insidious heralds of [[Lashonar]].
This has been adapted by Tegwen Hammersley from Eileen Óg/The [[Pride]] of Petravore, the original tune can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqGwm0CC0Wo here].
A recording of this song [[Will|will]] be uploaded as soon as possible
Dawnish knights, and Yeofolk and Weavers, 
In [[The Way|the Way]], I’m sure you’re all believers,
But these [[Birds|birds]] [[Will|will]] trick you, they’re deceivers, 
For they are [[The Heralds of Lashonar|the Heralds of Lashonar]].
They work for a fickle [[Eternal]],
Strive to do its deeds infernal, 
And their words [[Will|will]] put your soul in peril, 
For they are [[The Heralds of Lashonar|the Heralds of Lashonar]].
You may cry, and mourn for those you’ve lost, 
But your love is [[Gone|gone]], their sacrifice the [[Cost|cost]], 
And [[The Empire|the Empire]]’s wars, they are still there to be won
So don’t listen to the Heralds of [[Lashonar]]. 
[[Courage]] bids us stand against our Foe, 
[[Wisdom]] states, “To [[War]] we must Go!”
To these [[Calls|calls]] for peace we say no! 
Say no to [[The Heralds of Lashonar|the Heralds of Lashonar]].
[[Ambition]] means that we [[Will|will]] win this [[War]],
Our [[Prosperity]] is what it’s for. 
Our Empire, it always [[Will|will]] need more, 
But it doesn’t need the Heralds of [[Lashonar]]. 
Chorus
In this Barrens [[War]] [[Pride]] we find, 
And we stand with [[Loyalty]] behind, 
For these [[Druj]] no treaty will yet bind, 
All despite [[The Heralds of Lashonar|the Heralds of Lashonar]].
In the East we [[Fight|fight]] with [[Vigilance]], 
Come, my friends, and join with your Lance, 
So together take up this dance, 
All to spite the Heralds of [[Lashonar]]. 
Chorus
