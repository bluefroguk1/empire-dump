Following the of the 380YE Autumn Equniox, and the Events that preceded it, Lady Tamain Sepulchre composed this song to assist in pushing back against the insidious heralds of [[Lashonar]].
This has been adapted by Tegwen Hammersley from Eileen Óg/The [[Pride]] of Petravore, the original tune can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqGwm0CC0Wo here].
A recording of this song will be uploaded as soon as possible
Dawnish knights, and Yeofolk and Weavers, 
In [[The Way]], I’m sure you’re all believers,
But these [[Birds]] will trick you, they’re deceivers, 
For they are [[The Heralds of Lashonar]].
They work for a fickle [[Eternal]],
Strive to do its deeds infernal, 
And their words will put your soul in peril, 
For they are The Heralds of the Heralds of Lashonar.
You may cry, and mourn for those you’ve lost, 
But your love is gone, their sacrifice the [[Cost]], 
And [[The Empire]]’s Wars, they are still there to be won
So don’t listen to the Heralds of Lashonar. 
[[Courage]] bids us stand against our Foe, 
[[Wisdom]] states, “To [[War]] we must Go!”
To these calls for peace we say no! 
Say no to The Heralds of the Heralds of Lashonar.
[[Ambition]] means that we will win this War,
Our [[Prosperity]] is what it’s for. 
Our Empire, it always will need more, 
But it doesn’t need the Heralds of Lashonar. 
Chorus
In this Barrens War Pride we find, 
And we stand with [[Loyalty]] behind, 
For these [[Druj]] no treaty will yet bind, 
All despite The Heralds of the Heralds of Lashonar.
In the East we [[Fight]] with [[Vigilance]], 
Come, my friends, and join with your Lance, 
So together take up this dance, 
All to spite the Heralds of Lashonar. 
Chorus
