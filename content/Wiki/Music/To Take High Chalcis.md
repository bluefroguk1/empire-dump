Written by Nicassia of Phoenix Reach to commemorate the final stages [[Of The War|of the war]] against the Drujj in [[Reikos]], 379YE.
[[To Take High Chalcis]]
''By Nicassia of Phoenix Reach''
From [[The Nations|the nations]] they came to reclaim the land,
All were for [[Reikos]] bound, their weapons in hand..
Lights being lit in the [[Chapter|chapter]] house, felt half a world away,
Miles to go over cursed lands, [[All the way|all the way]]…
It came to a head in the red of [[Autumn|autumn]],
With rivers that ran full of a plague,
Five armies stood after months of [[War|war]], at the walls of that great fort,
And their Generals swore they’d push on, all [[The Way|the way]]...
[[All the way]] [[To Take High Chalcis|to take High Chalcis]]
All [[The Way|the way]] to  take High Chalcis
[[All the way]] to  take  High Chalcis
All [[The Way|the way]]…
[[Urizen]] and the Marchers, Highborn and [[The League|the League]],
Commanded from [[Anvil]], determined to save,
The [[Valiant Pegasus]] broke the walls, to end that foul siege, 
The four armies held and they pushed those broken gates:
Early next morning, through the clouds and the mud,
Through the [[Sentinel Gate|Sentinel gate]], the [[Heroes|heroes]] came,
[[Ritual]] stones causing miasma, the targets of the fray
And for all who had suffered, the Drujj would pay,
[[All the way]] [[To Take High Chalcis|to take High Chalcis]]
All [[The Way|the way]] to  take High Chalcis
[[All the way]] to  take  High Chalcis
All [[The Way|the way]]…
Flags they were raised, and [[Rituals|rituals]] started,
Mages all focused, soldiers kept foes at bay,
[[Wintermark]], [[Highguard]], [[Varushka]], [[Navarr]] and [[Urizen]],
Did Virtuous work in those cursed lands, all the way...
For thirteen years, the Highborn have waited,
Waited to punish the Drujj, and enter the fray,
Actions taken upon the  field, gain their just reward,
[[General]] Jericho’s orders had won the [[Day|day]].
All the way [[To Take High Chalcis|to take High Chalcis]]
All the way to  take High Chalcis
All the way to  take  High Chalcis
All the way…
