Lyrics by Jude 
Tune - 3 little monkeys
[[Five Little Ploughboys|Five little ploughboys]] marching off to [[War|war]]
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his brush and one forgot his comb
[[Five Little Ploughboys|Five little ploughboys]] had to march back home 
Four little plough boys marching off to  [[War|war]]
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his  pouch and one forgot his sack
Four little ploughboys had to march right back 
Three  little ploughboys marching off to war
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his ink and one forgot his pen 
Three little ploughboys turned around again
Two little ploughboys marching off to war
Pitchforks boldly held before
One forgot his hawk and one forgot his hound
Two little ploughboys had to turn around
One little ploughboy marching off to war
Pitchfork boldly held before
'Now it's getting dark come in,' his mummy said
One little plough boy went home to his bed
