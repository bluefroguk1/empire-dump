Title: The North wind doth blow

---
A simple traditional nursery rhyme, to an original tune [[File:North wind.mid]]
[[The North wind doth blow|The North Wind doth blow]]
And we shall have snow
And what will poor Robin do then?
Poor thing!
He'll sit in the barn
And keep himself warm
And tuck his head under his wing.
Poor thing!
