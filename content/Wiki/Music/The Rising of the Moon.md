Oh, then tell me John of Barrow, tell me why you hurry so?
Hush me neighbour hush and listen, and his cheeks were all a-glow,
I bear orders from [[The Captain|the captain]]; get you ready quick and soon,
For the bills must be together at [[The Rising of the Moon|the Rising of the Moon]].
Chorus:
At [[The Rising of the Moon|the rising of the moon]], at the rising of the moon
The bills must be together at the rising of the moon
Oh, then tell me John of Barrow, where the gathering is to be?
In the old spot by the river, right well known to you and me
One more word for signal token, whistle up the marching tune.
With your bill upon your shoulder at the rising of the moon
Chorus:
At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon,
With your bill upon your shoulder at the rising of the moon
Out of many a mud wall cottage, eyes were watching through the [[Night|night]],
Many a Marcher's heart was throbbing, for the coming morning light
Murmurs ran along the valley, like the banshees lonely croon
And a thousand bills were flashing at the rising of the moon
Chorus:
At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon,
And a thousand bills were flashing at the rising of the moon
There beside the singing river, that dark mass of men was seen
Far above their shining weapons hung their own beloved green
Death to every foe and traitor, forward strike the marching tune
And hurrah me boys for freedom, 'tis the rising of the moon
Chorus:
At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon,
And hurrah me boys for freedom, at the rising of the moon
At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon,
And hurrah me boys for freedom, at the rising of the moon
