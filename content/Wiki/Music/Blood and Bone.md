Based on the well-known, traditional British song, Over the Hills and Far Away.
Words by Brian Tollady.
Listen to Brian's rendition [https://youtu.be/FlMnqtgi_Is here].
With [[Blood and Bone|blood and bone]] we earnt our home,
We’ll [[Fight|fight]] and die for [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s [[Throne|throne]],
Loyal soldiers, oh come what may,
Through the [[Gate|gate]] and far away,
''Through the gate and far away,
''We hope to see our home one [[Day|day]],
''[[Warlord]] command and we’ll obey,
''Through the gate and far away,''
We used to sing of feet on roads,
Back broken under heavy loads,
And fiercely cherished boxes hung,
With [[Herbs|herbs]] and heavy fragrance swung,
But now these songs are echoes past,
Have we found our final verse at last,
If we leave or if we stay,
It's through the gate and far away,
''Chorus''
We gather once a year to raise,
The stories of our kin with praise,
Of items forged through sweat and gall,
Embodiment of virtues all,
A life of [[Worth|worth]] is often short,
For fists and blade are our retort,
[[War]] runs through our blood some say,
Oh, through the gate and far away,
''Chorus''
But from mouth to mouth this chant [[Will|will]] fly
And, from orc to orc [[Will|will]] never die,
A chant that beats through every vein,
To crush the question of our gain,
With [[Blood and Bone|blood and bone]] we earnt our home,
We’ll [[Fight|fight]] and die for [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s throne,
Loyal soldiers, oh come what may,
Through the gate and far away
''Chorus''
