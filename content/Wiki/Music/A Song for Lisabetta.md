Lyrics by Tiana i Zaydan i Riqueza 
The Flame that burns bright casts a long shadow
The journey you began, we are poised to follow
The flame that burns bright lasts for half as long
But the night is darkest before the [[Dawn]]
What did you see when you looked in the mirror?
A Prince of great [[Ambition]]? [[The Empire]] of your Vision?
What did you see when you looked to the future?
To make the hard decisions, despite your opposition?
They say you hid how much you cared behind a mask
Lest your love be mistook for [[Weakness]]
But the world would bend before you gave up on your task
May [[Holberg]]â€™s [[Pride]] forever serve as witness
You saw the beauty and the colour of the world
The great artistic renaissance your passion
But your smile gave me [[Courage]] when I forgot the words
May even your dissenters mourn your passing
What did you see when you looked in the mirror?
The fire hid behind the mask of dignity?
What did you see when you looked to the future?
A world where all people lived at liberty
