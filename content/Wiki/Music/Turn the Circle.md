[[Music]] by Kathryn and lyrics by Jude

Earth and dark holds seed and root 
To the sun rise leaf and shoot 
Rest shall follow all your toil 
[[Turn the Circle|Turn the circle]], turn the soil
Seeds that in the [[Spring]] were sown 
In the [[Autumn|autumn]] are full grown 
[[Children]] grow to grooms and brides 
[[Turn the Circle|Turn the circle]], turn the tides
Fields that grow with barley high 
In their turn must fallow lie 
Wicker men to ashes burn 
[[Turn the Circle|Turn the circle]], turn the sun
Long days full of warmth and light 
All must end with gentle [[Night|night]] 
Here's the wound no art can [[Heal|heal]] 
[[Turn the Circle|Turn the circle]], turn the wheel
Wounded, weary, sick and sore 
Lay down now to rise no more 
To the land that gave you birth 
[[Turn the Circle|Turn the circle]], turn the earth
