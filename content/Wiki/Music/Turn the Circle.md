A song about the cycle of life and death which resonates very strongly with Marcher ways.  Often [[Sung]] contemplatively as a solo, but can also be sung as a round (see the first recording below for an example).
[[Music]] by Kathryn and lyrics by Jude
A recording of this song can be found [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/TurntheCircle.mp3 here] and [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/TurntheCircle_newer.mp3 here] and sheet music is available [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/[[Turn_the_Circle]].pdf here] 
Earth and dark holds seed and root 
To the sun rise leaf and shoot 
Rest shall follow all your toil 
[[Turn the Circle]], turn the soil
Seeds that in the Spring were sown 
In the autumn are fUll grown 
Children grow to grooms and brides 
Turn the circle, turn the tides
Fields that grow with barley high 
In their turn must fallow lie 
Wicker men to ashes burn 
Turn the circle, turn the sun
Long days full of Warmth and light 
All must end with gentle night 
Here's the wound no art can [[Heal]] 
Turn the circle, turn the wheel
Wounded, weary, sick and sore 
Lay down now to rise no more 
To the land that gave you birth 
Turn the circle, turn the earth
