[[Sir Isobel]] was a valiant knight
She was fair as a lily 
She took up her sword and she went to [[Fight|fight]]
Fair and pale as a lily
When she came to Applefell
All armoured in her coat of mail
She was brave as a lion and she was as fair as a lily
Out came the ripper from its den
She was fair as a lily
It'd killed a dozen village men
Fair and pale as a lily
When it saw the knight so brave
It bared its teeth in spite and rage
She was brave as a lion and she was as fair as a lily
The ripper had a fearsome hide
She was fair as a lily 
It could the sharpest steel abide
Fair and pale as a lily
Her blade rebounded from its skin
It seemed a battle none could win
She was brave as a lion and she was as fair as a lily
They fought until the [[Day|day]] was done
She was fair as a lily 
Blood spilled red as [[The setting|the setting]] sun
Fair and pale as a lily
The ripper gaped its jaws and roared
And down its throat she thrust her sword
She was brave as a lion and she was as fair as a lily
The ripper fell to rise no more
She was fair as a lily 
But Isobel's wounds were deep and sore
Fair and pale as a lily
We bore her to a shady dell
And bade her there a sad farewell
She was brave as a lion and she was as fair as a lily
Though to the labyrinth she's [[Gone|gone]]
She was fair as a lily 
Her name and [[Glory|glory]] shall live on
Fair and pale as a lily
Across the land I'll spread her fame
That all shall know our hero's name
She was brave as a lion and she was as fair as a lily
