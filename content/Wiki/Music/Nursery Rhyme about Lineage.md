Hey Daddy, if I'm not allowed to sing this because it's rude then why did you start laughing as soon as the lady left the tent?
Sharp horns, gold eyes, stop your ears against their lies
Knife ears, stag's horn, rue the day that they were born
Scaled skin, fangs white, never meant to see the light
Gilled neck, webbed toes, best kept where the pondweed grows
Beast's eyes, pale skin, bar [[The Door]] lest they come in
Bark skin, green vine, Cursed until the end of time
