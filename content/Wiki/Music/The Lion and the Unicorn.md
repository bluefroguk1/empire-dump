Trad. The Keeper Did A-Hunting Go. A rather slow version [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-LB2i5On5c here].
OOC lyrics by Jude Reid.
The lion did a hunting go
Down in the woods where the green leaves grow
All for to feast on a stag or a doe
Among the leaves so green o
There in the woods was a unicorn
Silver mane and long white horn
A nobler beast was never born
Among the leaves so green o
Chorus:
''Come with me (Come with me)
''Come and see (Come and see)''
''[[The Lion and the Unicorn]]''
''Among the leaves so green o''
The lion flexed her cruel claws
And spittle dripped from her mighty jaws
She thought that she'd devour him raw
Among the leaves so green o
The unicorn cried 'Don't eat me
Although in truth I'd honoured be
I know a more fitting meal for thee
Among the leaves so green o'
Chorus:
'Up on yonder leafy hill
There lies a stag that's newly killed
And there you may go and eat your fill
Among the leaves so green o'
The lion followed where he led on
Though she laughed at the foolish unicorn
She'd eat him up and leave just the horn
Among the leaves so green o
Chorus:
He led her to a leafy glade
And there she found a table laid
With meats all roasted and displayed
Among the leaves so green o
But as she sprang and feasted there
Around her neck the hunter's snare
Pulled her high up in the air
Among the leaves so green o
Chorus:
The lion roared in rage and spite
The hunter's snare it held her tight
And there she hung both [[Day|day]] and [[Night|night]]
Among the leaves so green o
The lion pleaded all in vain
The unicorn went home again
Lord and master of his domain
Among the leaves so green o
Chorus:
