To the tune of 'Men of Harlech' as performed [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjvKZHJeayg&feature=youtube_gdata_player here]
[[Men of Fenrose]] stop your dreaming
Can't you see their spear points gleaming
See their warrior pennants [[Streaming|streaming]]
To this battlefield
[[Men of Fenrose]] stand ye steady
It can never be said that ye
For the battle were not ready
Marchers never yield
From the hills rebounding
Hear our warcry sounding
Summon all at [[Mournwold]]'s call
The mighty force surrounding
Men of Fenrose on to [[Glory|glory]]
This [[Will|will]] ever be your story
Keep these [[Burning|burning]] words before ye
Marchers [[Will|will]] not yield
