## [[Riqueza]]'s Dream
A highborn lady I was born and raised
In [[Bastion]]'s halls where I spent my days
Chorus:
My sisters, come along with me, a [[Highguard]] slave I'll not be
My sisters, come along with me, a [[Highguard]] slave I'll not be
As I lay dreaming in the dead of [[Night|night]]
The sky was split by a comet's flight
Chorus
And I dreamed I travelled to a far country
[[Will]] you rise up my sisters, [[Will|will]] you come with me?
Chorus
I dreamed I walked along the road outside
And I left that city where I'll no more abide
Chorus
I dreamed I walked into the mountains high
Where I reached to heaven and I touched the sky
Chorus
I dreamed I travelled to the barren plain
Where the winds blew dry and I prayed for rain
Chorus
I dreamed I'd come at last to find the shore
And there I'd settle and I'd go no more
Chorus
I dreamed a nation was my [[Legacy|legacy]]
For a [[Freeborn|freeborn]] people shall my [[Children|children]] be
Chorus
It may be a simple dream and nothing more
Still I'll set my course to that distant shore
Chorus
