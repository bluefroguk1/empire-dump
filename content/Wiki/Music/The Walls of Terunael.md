Lyrics and Melody adapted by Ian Thomas. (link to come) 
Chorus
[[The Walls of Terunael|The walls of Terunael]] we've left behind
The brightest of cities are broken and grey
As we walk an endless road how [[Will|will]] we find
All that was stolen away, Liaven
All that was stolen away?
Verse 1
The city is joyous, the bell tower peals
A festival spirit, a respite from woes
Our vates call down power to the crops in the fields
But the only crop here is for crows, Liaven
The only crop here is for crows.
As the walls start to crumble, there's no cause for dread
Our army's unbeaten, our [[Magic|magic]]'s still strong
But then out from the palace [[Black Thorns|black thorns]] start to spread
And our strength and our [[Courage|courage]] is [[Gone|gone]], Liaven
Our strength and our [[Courage|courage]] is gone.
Chorus
Verse 2
Just a handful of warriors escape [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]]
We've made it much further than our dead would have dreamed,
They lie in piles broken by the vines and the thorns
When this morning how lively they seemed, Liaven,
This morning how lively they seemed.
The forests they offer the comfort of [[Night|night]]
We huddle together, our tears mourn the dead
[[Navarr]] she stands up; says she won't lose this [[Fight|fight]]
And the oaths on her skin are marked red, Liaven
The oaths on her skin are marked red
Chorus
Verse 3
We set our feet forward and shoulder our loads
Walk spirals unending through lands far away
We bind our disaster in chains made from roads
And our journeying keeps it at bay, Liaven
Our journeying keeps it at bay.
A people in exile, a travelling [[Tribe|tribe]]
We wander with purpose, our course is well laid
One Empire is lost but its spirit survives
And we'll cherish this new one we've made, Liaven
We'll cherish this new one we've made.
Alt Chorus x2
And [[The Walls of Terunael|the walls of Terunael]] we've left behind
The brightest of cities are broken and grey
As we walk an endless road we'll keep in mind
All that was stolen away, Liaven
All that was stolen away.
