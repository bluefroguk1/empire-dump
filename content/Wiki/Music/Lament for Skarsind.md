[[Skarsind]] lay chilled in the cold of the winter
Huddled for heat every human and beast
Hoarfrost was hard On the Walls and the towers 
When the orc armies came like a storm in the east
Swift were the soldiers and keen was their [[Courage]]
Ceaseless the struggle and fierce was the [[Fight]]
But for every Orc slain there were six standing ready
And Skarsind's walls fell to the inhuman blight
Survivors brought tidings of terror to [[Hahnmark]] 
Though frost took their fingers and hard fell the snow
As heavy as lead were their hearts as they told us:
'Skarsgard is fallen and fast comes the foe.'
'Our walls still stand strong and the soldiers stand ready,
And each citizen will bear arms to defend
But our numbers are few and we never will hold them
For they come in their hundreds and seem without end.'
Then up came the voice of Inge SuvVisdottir
Her brow bound with gold, and her words cold and clear
'[[Wintermark]] lives by the strength of three peoples,
And now we have need of each of of them here.'
'Send word to the [[Suaq]] and to Kallivesa
Command them to come without any delay
Then give me nine Warriors sworn to my banner  
To harry the horde and to hold them at bay.'
The swiftest of messengers bore forth the orders
While Inge sTrode out to the eye of the storm
And nine nights and days in The Mountains she fought them
Till at last she was slain and the foemen marched on
There at the borderlands army met army
Great deeds were done and they won great renown
Long nights they fought, and the orc Tribes were vanquished
But gone was brave Inge and lost was the crown
A tear for the Skarsind, lost land and lost people
A tear for the hero in battle [[Laid low]]
A tear for the shame, till at last we take vengeance
With steel in our hands, and their blood on the snow.
