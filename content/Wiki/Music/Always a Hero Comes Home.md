Adaptation of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8lqZ-gjWQI&feature=kp "A Hero Comes Home"] by Alan Silvestri 
Lyrics and Melody adapted by Joshua Binks (link to come).
Prelude
Out of the mist of [[History|history]],
He'll come again.
Sailing on ships across the sea
To our wounded Nation.
Signs of a saviour,
Like [[Fire on the Water|fire on the water]].
Its what we prayed for,
One of our own.
Call
Just wait, though wide he may roam.
Response
[[Always a Hero Comes Home|Always a hero comes home]].
[[Calls]]
He'll go where no-one can go.
He'll [[Fight|fight]] what no-one could [[Fight|fight]].
''Continue in this style, making up things for the hero to do until the end;''
Call
He stands, brave and alone.
Response
But [[Always a Hero Comes Home|always a hero comes home]].
