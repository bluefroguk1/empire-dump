Words and tune by Dhiamara Coulson. [https://soundcloud.com/thecynicalselfadoration/[[Urizen]]-1-voices tune]
A story song, by Salviana of Endsmeet [[Spire]]
[[Voices Call]] in mountains high
To Rituals it's time to cry
Be Wary now
Be wary thee
The consequences of your dreams.
We've heard the callings night and day
Where stars once shone the sun doth play
And on the wind a might song
Of fallen comrades
Death of sons.
We've travelled through these misty peaks
An old world cracks beneath our feet
Through [[Fight]] and [[Glory]] tales and more
Your journey ends
At the Spire door.
