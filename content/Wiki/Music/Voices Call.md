Words and tune by Dhiamara Coulson. [https://soundcloud.com/thecynicalselfadoration/[[Urizen|urizen]]-1-voices tune]
A story song, by Salviana of Endsmeet [[Spire]]
[[Voices Call|Voices call]] in mountains high
To [[Rituals|rituals]] it's time to cry
Be wary now
Be wary thee
The consequences of your dreams.
We've heard the callings [[Night|night]] and [[Day|day]]
Where stars once shone the sun doth play
And on the wind a might song
Of fallen comrades
Death of sons.
We've travelled through these misty peaks
An old world cracks beneath our feet
Through [[Fight|fight]] and [[Glory|glory]] tales and more
Your journey ends
At the [[Spire]] door.
