Original Song: Bonny Portmore (Trad) - http://youtu.be/cX31BGlMEU8
New Lyrics by Joanna VanderHoeven
O 'Terunael, you shine where you stand   [G Am C Am]
And the more I think on you the more I think long  [G Am C G]
If I had you now as I had once before  [Am Bm Gsus Am]
All the lords in [[The Empire]] could not save Terunael.  [Am Bm Gsus D]
O Ternuael, I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction of adorned city
For it stood in the [[Forest]] for many's the long day
Till the days The [[The Vallorn]] came and stole it away.
O Terunael, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before  
All the Lords in the Empire could not save Terunael.
All the [[Birds]] in the forest they bitterly weep
Saying, "Where shall we shelter or where shall we sleep?"
For [[The Oak]] and the Ash, they are all now [[Vallorn]]
And [[The Walls of Terunael]] are all down to the ground.
O Terunael, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the Lords of the Empire could not save Terunael.
