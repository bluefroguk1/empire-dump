Lyrics by Daisy and Jude. The tune is very roughly based on Debochadan by Severa Nazarkhan, from her album [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000QUCPKW Sen].
It is said that the nine declarations made in this Empire [[Battle Anthem|battle anthem]] each refer to one of the nine Imperial nations. Which one is which is, however, a matter of much debate...
A pdf of the lyrics and the tune can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/1/12/[[Battle Anthem|Battle_Anthem]].pdf here].

I am the spear that's swift to strike in anger
I am the shield that turns all foes away
I am the walls raised high against the darkness
Standing fast until the [[Day|day]].
''One voice, one people and one Empire
''One [[Throne|throne]] and one [[Loyalty|loyalty]]
''One [[Will|will]] to drive us ever onward
''One glorious destiny!''
I am the iron quarried from the mountains
Forged in fire till only steel remains
I am the wind that gives [[The Empire|the Empire]] breath and life
I am the quick blood in its veins.
''One voice, one people and one Empire
''One throne and one [[Loyalty|loyalty]]
''One [[Will|will]] to drive us ever onward
''One glorious destiny!''
I am the flame that burns inside [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s heart
I am the earth's great bones, steadfast and sure
I am the bonds that hold us fast in fellowship
That forever [[Will|will]] endure
''One voice, one people and one Empire
''One throne and one [[Loyalty|loyalty]]
''One [[Will|will]] to drive us ever onward
''One glorious destiny!''
