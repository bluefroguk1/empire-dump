Lyrics by Daisy and Jude. The tune is very roughly based on Debochadan by Severa Nazarkhan, from her album [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000QUCPKW Sen].
It is said that the nine Declarations made in this Empire [[Battle Anthem]] each refer to one of the nine Imperial nations. Which one is which is, however, a matter of much debate...
A pdf of the lyrics and the tune can be found [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/1/12/[[Battle_Anthem]].pdf here].
RECORDING of this song : Media:battle-anthem.mp3

I am the spear that's swift to strike in anger
I am the shield that turns all foes away
I am the walls raised high against the darkness
Standing fast until the day.
''One voice, one people and one Empire
''One throne and one [[Loyalty]]
''One will to drive us ever onWard
''One glorious destiny!''
I am the iron quarried from The Mountains
Forged in fire till only steel remains
I am the wind that gives [[The Empire]] breath and life
I am the quick blood in its veins.
''One voice, one people and one Empire
''One throne and one loyalty
''One will to drive us ever onward
''One glorious destiny!''
I am the flame that burns inside the Empire's heart
I am the earth's great bones, steadfast and sure
I am the bonds that hold us fast in fellowship
That forever will endure
''One voice, one people and one Empire
''One throne and one loyalty
''One will to drive us ever onward
''One glorious destiny!''
