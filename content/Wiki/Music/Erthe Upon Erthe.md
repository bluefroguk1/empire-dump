"Their blasted chanting gets into your head... it is solid and endless, like their marching battle lines. On and on they chant, and every so often you hear something you understand amongst the guttural noise - something about sharp blades, or rotting flesh. It is one thing facing this across a battlefield and another thing entirely to be amongst it." 
This early English song provides a great sound for Imperial Orc chanting (or if you prefer steady, low singing). The tune is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eUWs1tDUqY here] but this is a rather light/fast version which isn't particularly suited to [[Imperial Orcs]]. 
Each vowel tends to have its own syllable so it should be pronounced e.g. "Erth - e", "wroch - te", " has - e" on - e" etc. This gives the songs a driving rhythm.
Erthe out of erthe is wonderly wroghte
Erthe hase geten one erthe a dignite of noghte
[[Erthe Upon Erthe|Erthe upon erthe]] hase sett alle his thoghte
How that [[Erthe Upon Erthe|erthe upon erthe]] may be heghe broghte
Erthe upon erthe wolde be a kinge
Bot how erthe to erthe shall thinkes he no thinge
When erthe bredes erthe and his rentes home bringe
[[Thane]] shall erthe of erthe have full harde parting
Erthe upon erthe winnes castells and towrres
Thane sayse erthe unto erthe, "This es al ourres"
When erthe upon erthe has bigged up his barres
Thane shall erthe for erthe suffere sharpe scowrres
Erthe goes upon erthe as molde upon molde
He that gose upon erthe, gleterande as golde
Like erthe never more go to erthe sholde
And yitt shall erthe unto erthe ga rathere than he wolde
Whye erthe lurves erthe, wondere me thinke
Or why erthe for erthe sholde other swete or swinke
For when erthe upon erthe has broughte within brinke
Thane shall erthe of erthe have a foul stinke
