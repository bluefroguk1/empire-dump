The [[Carts Come Home|carts come home]], the oxen heavy laden
With Marcher bones, brought from another nation
Our girls come home, in fallow fields they're lying
And all alone, I see the farmer crying.
The [[Carts Come Home|carts come home]], the oxen heavy laden
Our orchards grown, [[Will|will]] hang heavy in the [[Autumn|autumn]]
Our girls come home, in fallow fields they're lying
For seeds are sown, where other flowers lie dying
