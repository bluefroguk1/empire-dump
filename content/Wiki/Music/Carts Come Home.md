The carts come home, the oxen heavy laden
With Marcher bones, brought from another nation
Our girls come home, in fallow fields they're lying
And all alone, I see the Farmer crying.
The carts come home, the oxen heavy laden
Our orchards grown, will hang heavy in the autumn
Our girls come home, in fallow fields they're lying
For seeds are sown, where other flowers lie dying
