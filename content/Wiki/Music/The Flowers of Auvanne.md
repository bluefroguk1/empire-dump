[[The Flowers of Auvanne]] is a well known song written by [[Elayne Silverlark]] before the Empire was formed. While the arrangement Elayne used has been lost, there are a number of versions claiming to be the original played throughout [[Dawn]] to this day.
This has been written by Peter Green.
Some examples of tunes of this song are below. Player Characters are welcome to have heard these versions of the song throughout Dawn, but are not to be considered an exhaustive list. Players are welcome to submit other arrangements of this tune to the Dawnish egregores for inclusion below.

The sky was blue and bright,
The air was cold and still,
[[The Flowers of Auvanne]]
Gathered upon the hill.
They were not the strongest,
The quickest or most daring,
But they were truly steadfast,
Determined and unerring.
Knights with their brightest shields,
Physiks with their potent herbs.
A troubadour with trumpets blaring
Waiting on the enemy to disturb.
Sir Endric stood firm and steady,
His armour shining in the sun.
His sword in noble hand held
His legend to soon be won.
Has Dawn seen such heroes since?
Such glory and such beauty,
Enough to make bards weep
As they described them in their duty.
When the orcs came up the hill,
With swords and shields and maces,
The brave heroes held their ground,
Against the hundred barbarian faces.
The Flowers fell on by one by one,
The bright lives ended and plucked,
But the hill stayed with Semmerholm,
And an entire keep to construct.
On the next hazy summerâ€™s day
Where the meadows are wild and free
Go and visit that self same hill
Sit under the tallest tree.
And know heart beats knowledge
Brutal strength or unbeatable skill,
All you need is Dawnish spirit,
A passionate heart, indomitable will.
