The sky was blue and bright,
The air was cold and still,
[[The Flowers of Auvanne]]
Gathered upon the hill.
They were not the strongest,
The quickest or most daring,
But they were truly steadfast,
Determined and unerring.
Knights with their brightest shields,
Physiks with their potent [[Herbs|herbs]].
A [[Troubadour|troubadour]] with trumpets blaring
Waiting on the enemy to disturb.
Sir Endric stood firm and steady,
His armour shining in the sun.
His sword in noble hand held
His legend to soon be won.
Has [[Dawn]] seen such [[Heroes|heroes]] since?
Such [[Glory|glory]] and such beauty,
Enough to make bards weep
As they described them in their duty.
When the orcs came up the hill,
With swords and shields and maces,
The brave [[Heroes|heroes]] held their ground,
Against the hundred [[Barbarian|barbarian]] faces.
The Flowers fell on by one by one,
The bright lives ended and plucked,
But the hill stayed with [[Semmerholm]],
And an entire keep to construct.
On the next hazy [[Summer|summer]]â€™s day
Where the meadows are wild and free
Go and visit that self same hill
Sit under the tallest tree.
And know heart beats knowledge
Brutal strength or unbeatable skill,
All you need is Dawnish spirit,
A passionate heart, indomitable [[Will|will]].
