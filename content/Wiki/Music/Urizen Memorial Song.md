Words and tune by Claire Sheridan [https://soundcloud.com/herecosyouare-1/memorial-part-2 tune]
Manuscript by Aneurin Redman-White [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/iMages/2/25/Memorial_Song.pdf PDF]
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
Immortal spirits, through virtues we try,
To make the most of each of our lives.
To return from the Labyrinth enriched and enlightened,
Beginning again to learn and to strive. 
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
The Labyrinth will take us, our own time will come,
To walk for a while away from the sun,
While on [[The Way]] our path only moves forWard,
Mourn not the soul that is sure to return.
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
Where there is darkness, we will make light,
We will lead others on the path that is right,
Though the price may seem high, life is never lost,
When given in earnest, here in our sight. 
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
We are all human, our spirits live on,
Though these vessels who were our companions are gone.
Follow the Paragons, follow the Way,
Follow your loved ones into the fray,
Each day is a battle for control of the self,
We will triumph ourselves over death one day.
