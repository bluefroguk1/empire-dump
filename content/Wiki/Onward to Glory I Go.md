Based on I Don Quixote from the Man of La Mancha
Lyrics by Martin Hobbs

Songs like this are very popular amongst the minstrels who accompany [[Questing knight|questing knights]], who often insert the names of their own company into the song and tweak the lyrics to fit the heroic exploits of their own groups. The tune originates in the playhouses of [[Sarvos]], but its heritage is irrelevant to the Dawnish knights. Troubadours find it a useful tool as the popular music and stirring tune can quickly inspire feelings of [[Pride]] and [[glory]] in the listeners. [[The League|League]] cynics who suggest that the original song was a criticism of Dawnish culture are entirely ignored.


Hear me, heathens and wizards
And serpents of sin!
All your dastardly doings are past,
For a noble endeavour is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last!

I am Ozren de Orzel
A Knight of the Empire,
My destiny calls and I go,
And the wild winds of fortune
Will carry me onward,
Whithersoever they blow.
Onward to glory I go!
Onward to glory I go!

I'm Starac! Yes, I'm Starac!
I'll follow my Earl till the end.
I'll tell all the world proudly
He’s Lord Orzel! He’s my friend!

Hear me now
Oh thou bleak and barbarian world,
Thou art base and debauched as can be;
And the knights with their banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurl down their gauntlets to thee!

We are brave, Dawnish Nobles,
The Knights of the Empire,
Our destiny calls and we go,
And the wild winds of fortune
Will carry us onward,
Whithersoever they blow.
Onward to glory we go!
Onward to glory we go!

Oh the trumpets of glory
Now call us to fight,
Yes, the trumpets are calling us on,
And wherever we fight,
Ever staunch at our sides
Our Earl and companions shall be!

We are brave, Dawnish Nobles,
The Knights of the Empire,
Our destiny calls and we go,
And the wild winds of fortune
Will carry us onward,
Whithersoever they blow.
Onward to glory we go,
Onward to glory we go!

We’re yeomen! Yes, we’re yeomen!
We'll follow our nobles till the end.
We'll tell all the world proudly
We’re their yeoman! We’re their friends!

We are brave, Dawnish Nobles,
The Knights of the Empire,
Destroyers of evil are we
And we’ll march to the sound
Of the trumpets of glory
Forever to conquer will we!
