## Overview
The Dean of the Academy is an [[Imperial title]] [[Create_title_of_Dean_of_the_Academy|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] in Spring 379YE. The title had significant constitutional implications, and was eventually [[The Throne#Ratification|ratified]] by [[Empress Lisabetta]] during the Spring Equinox 380YE.

## Responsibilities
The Dean of the Academy is expected to use their power to raise a [[Senate motion|motion]] in the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] on behalf of the [[Academy Student Council]]. It is important to realise, however, that as always the holder of an Imperial title may do whatever they wish with the powers granted to them.   

## Powers
It is important to note that while the Dean of Students has the ability to propose a motion to the Senate they do not have the ability to vote, speak, or make announcements.
### Proposal
The Dean of Students can [[Senate motion#Proposal|propose]] one motion to the Senate each summit. The Dean follows all the normal rules and [[Senate_motion#Limitations|limitations]] regarding senate motions - including the requirement to find someone else to second that motion, the requirement that it be submitted to the civil service, and the requirement for it to pass [[scrutiny]].

The Dean of Students can also second one motion raised by someone else each summit.
## Appointment
The Dean of the Academy is an Imperial position [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#Imperial_Position|appointed by the Senate]]. As a title created by a motion with constitutional implications, the appointment requires a [[Senate_motion#Constitutional_Vote|two-thirds majority]] vote of the [[senator|senators]] of the Empire, whether or not they are present, or even in position at that time. Only Senators may vote - the [[Conscience of the Senate]] may not participate, and the appointment may be [[veto|vetoed]] by the [[Imperial Synod]] as with any other [[Senate_motion#Constitutional_Vote|constitutional vote]]. 

Any Imperial citizen can hold this title - the title is ''not'' restricted to members of the Academy staff. The Dean serves for a year. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]] and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
