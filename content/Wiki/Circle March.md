Shaker hymn.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xti9lXz3lVI Circle March on youtube (arranged by Katy Cooper)]
A slightly different version (which would work in harmony) is [http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/mediawiki-public/images/f/f1/CircleMarch.pdf here], transcribed by Aaron Walter

Love to see them moving round
Love to hear the drums a-beating
Love to hear the trumpet sound

Lo lo lo etc.
