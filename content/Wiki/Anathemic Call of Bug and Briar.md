## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 At the end of the ritual one of the [[Rituals#Contributors|contributors]] is chosen to deliver the curse with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]].



### Effects

This ritual creates a [[curse]] that is delivered to a target with a [[curse#Pronouncement of Doom|pronouncement of doom]]: one [[Rituals#Contributors|contributors]] is chosen to deliver the curse, and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own head. 

While under the curse, the target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]; they often suffer from itchy skin, and are regularly targeted by biting or stinging insects when they are in a natural setting.

While under the curse the target loses half of any production that would have been provided by a [[farm]], [[forest]] or [[herb garden]] resource.

The additional production provided by an [[enchantment]] such as [[Rampant Growth]] or [[Gathering the Harvest]] is not affected by this curse.



### Removing the Curse
The curse can be removed by certain powerful creatures or items.

## Description
This [[curse]] focuses the fecund energies of the Spring realm onto a target, and through them onto their resources. Insects and parasites breed with frightening speed around them, and uncontrolled fertility causes rhododendrons, briars, weeds and fungi to breed at supernatural speed, overwhelming the valuable vegetation that their wealth relies on. It makes little difference if the target abandons their [[farm]], [[forest]], or [[herb garden]] - within a few days the same unnatural growths begin to overwhelm their new resource.

Several [[eternal|eternals]] of Spring are known to have the power to remove this curse - and to deliver their own variants of it - especially [[Yaw'nagrah]] and [[Llofir]]. Unfortunately, both are more inclined to encourage the curse than to discourage the supernatural growth it causes; it generally requires a great deal of effort to encourage them to assist. By contrast, some eternals of Winter (notably [[Kaela]]) are more than happy to help remove the effect... but this rarely leaves the resource in question any more productive.

During the [[381YE_Spring_Equinox_Conclave_sessions|Spring Equinox 381YE]], then-[[Archmage]] of Spring Rosamund Holt raised a [[Declaration#Declaration of Concord|Declaration of Concord]] suggesting that the common name of the ritual was "stupid" and should be changed. The [[Imperial Conclave]] agreed.

## Common Elements
As with many curses, this ritual often involves a recitation of the grievances against the target, casting aside food or [[forest]] resources, invoking the rune [[Bravash]], or calling on the names of [[eternal|eternals]] such as [[Yaw'nagrah]] or [[Llofir]].
