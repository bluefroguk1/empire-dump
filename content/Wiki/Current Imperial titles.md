## Overview
This page lists the names of all Imperial citizens who currently hold an Imperial title. 
Previous title holders are listed historically below (as recorded at the end of the relevant summit).
For more information on how they were elected, please refer to [[imperial elections]] and the [[Election schedule]]

## The Throne
Uniquely the Imperial Throne wields significant power in the Senate, Synod, Conclave and Military Council.

## Imperial Senate
### Senators
A [[Senator]] has the right to raise a [[Senate motion|motion]] in the [[Imperial Senate]] and crucially to vote on the outcome. Each senator is elected to represent a single territory and may be expected to serve the interests of the occupants of that territory.

### Member of the Senate
[[Senate_session#Member_of_the_Senate|Members of the Senate]] have the right to speak in the Senate, to partake in the debate when motions are discussed. Some members also have the right to vote or to raise a motion.

### Ambassadors
Ambassadors are usually appointed by the Imperial Senate - they are expected to take the lead in diplomatic relations with the foreign power or entity and all official ambassadors have the right to negotiate a [[Ambassador#Treaty|treaty]]. A [[senator]] must use a [[Senate motion]] to submit the treaty for ratification by the Senate - but ratification only requires a single senate motion, regardless of how many legal changes are required to ratify the treaty. 

### Advisors and Consuls
The Imperial Senate has delegated a number of powers to individual titles giving them the ability to employ legal powers normally reserved for the Senate such as the power to instruct the department for [[historical research]] or order a [[commission]]. Some of these positions incorporate the responsibility to provide the Senate with advice and council on a specific subject.

## [[Imperial Synod]]
### [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|The Assembly of the Nine]]
After the General Assembly, the Assembly of the Nine is the most powerful of the individual assemblies of the Synod. The Assembly of Nine consists of the eight cardinals appointed by the virtue assemblies and the Throne. Each member of the Assembly is able to raise a single judgement and has a single vote.

### The Gatekeepers
Each of the seven cardinals of Virtue is able to appoint a single gatekeeper. The gatekeepers decide who is to receive one of the precious doses of true liao each summit, and some serve as close allies and assistants of their respective cardinal.

### The Inquisitors
The Virtue inquisitors are intended to form an Inquisitorial court in conjunction with the Imperial Inquisitor, to oversee inquisitions and ensure their accountability and transparency.

### The Champions of Virtue
The Champions of Virtue are the bearers of the artefact [[Pilgrim's Shield|Pilgrim's Shields]], and serve as inspirations to the pilgrims of the faith and laity as to what it means to be Virtuous, particularly in a military context.

### Envoys
The Imperial Senate has delegated a number of powers to individual titles giving them the ability to employ legal powers normally reserved for the Synod such as the power to conduct an inquisition or to withdraw funds from the Virtue fund. Most of these envoys have very specific responsibilities or areas of concern.


## [[Imperial Military Council]]
### Generals
A [[General]] has the right to issue campaign [[Army orders|orders]] to the [[Imperial army]] they lead. They can also speak in the [[Imperial Military Council]] and vote to decide in the [[Muster]] which battle opportunities presented by the [[Sentinel Gate]] will be pursued.

### Member of the Military Council
Members of the Military Council can raise issues and speak in the [[Imperial Military Council]] and vote to decide in the [[Muster]] which battle opportunities presented by the [[Sentinel Gate]] will be pursued.

## [[Imperial Conclave]]
### Grandmasters
Although every magician may vote, only the [[grandmaster]] of a [[Conclave order]] or [[the Throne]] can authorize a citizen to speak in the Imperial Conclave. They also have control of the considerable resources of their order.

### Archmages
Each [[archmage]] represents the Empire to the various inhabitants of their appropriate [[realm]]. To empower them to carry out their work, each archmage may choose to send a short missive to a single named [[eternal]] of their realm each summit.

### College Masters
Each of these titles has control of an Imperial [[college of magic]] granting them the ability to direct the Empire's magicians to create new rituals.

### Agents of the Conclave
The Imperial Necromancer has control of the Imperial Regio for the second half of the hour when it is possible to cast Whispers through the Black Gate, on each day of each summit. The Imperial Necromancer may choose which covens may use the regio in this time, and the order in which they may use it. 

## [[Imperial Bourse]]
The most significant titles in the Bourse are commonly referred to as Bourse seats. Almost all these seats provide the citizen who controls them with a significant supply of bourse materials each season. Controllers of Imperial seats will usually sell these materials to the highest bidder, controllers of national seats are sometimes expected to provide materials at reduced rates for worthy causes to members of their nation. For historical reasons the [[Master of the Imperial Mint]] and the [[Castellan of Spiral Castle]] are both considered to be a Bourse seat even though neither are associated with the production of bourse resources any longer.
### Ilium Seats

### Mithril Seats

### Weirwood Seats

### White Granite Seats

### Other Seats

## Other Titles
There are scores of other Imperial titles - many of which are relatively minor in nature. A [[sinecure]] or [[ministry]] might provide a wealthy income but rarely includes any legal powers or significant responsibilities beyond ensuring the safety of the structure that provides the income. 
### Senate Appointment
These titles are appointed by unanimous decision of the senators of the appropriate nation, or by vote of the Senate if the senators cannot decide. These positions are usually important or relevant for national politics.

### Military Council
These titles are appointed by [[Powers_of_the_Imperial_Military_Council#Appointment|simple majority of any members of the Military Council]] who are eligible to vote and are present when the election takes place. A national position appointed by the Military Council follows the same process, but only the generals of that nation are allowed to vote. 

### Bourse Auction
Like the more significant Bourse seats, these Imperial titles are elected by [[Auction of the Seats]] - going to the highest bidder. They usually provide the controller with access to a  valuable ministry or a sinecure that provides herbs, mana crystals or other resources which may be available for sale.

### Tally of the Votes
Like national Bourse seats, these Imperial titles are elected by [[Tally of the Votes]] - going to whichever candidate enjoys the most support from citizens of their nation. They usually provide the controller with access to a  valuable ministry or a sinecure that provides herbs, mana crystals or other resources which may be available for sale.

### Conclave Declaration
These seats are elected by declaration of [[candidacy]] in the Imperial Conclave. They often provide the recipient with an income of important magical materials of some kind.

### Synod Judgement
These seats are elected by judgement of [[appointment]] by the appropriate assembly of the Imperial Synod when they fall vacant. They often provide the recipient with additional Synod votes or liao.

### Throne Appointment
These titles are directly appointed by the Throne and are usually expected to serve the interests of the current Throne.

### Cardinal Appointment
The Curator of the Printer's Guild Museum is directly appointed by the Cardinal of Prosperity when they assume office. The position provides the recipient with additional Synod votes and liao.

### Other Methods
These titles are often elected by a national contest of some form. The knight-protectors of Dawn who win their title by victory in a grand tourney whereas the Doyen of the Spires must win a vote of their peers. The holders of these titles are often expected to employ the powers of their title in service to their nation where appropriate.
