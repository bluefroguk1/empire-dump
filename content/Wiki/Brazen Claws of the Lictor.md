## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must have the [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] skill.

 

### Effects
The target gains the ability to cast the [[entangle]] spell four times per day as if they knew it without spending any mana.

They also experience a [[roleplaying effect]]: you are reminded of every favour or debt you owe, or are owed, and of every grudge you bear against people who have wronged you. It is hard to resist the urge to settle grudges, especially if those people are nearby. 





### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 11. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description
This [[enchantment]] allows the target to wrap their enemies in invisible chains, As with [[Stance of the Constricting Scourge]] this ritual allows the target to restrict the moment of their opponent using the [[entangle]] spell without having to expend personal mana. It is useful against skirmishing opponents on the battlefield, but it is also sometimes used to help capture gangs of fugitive criminals.

The ritual evokes themes of ownership, punishment and control. It encourages the target to take vengeance on those they consider to have wronged them, meaning it is often viewed with suspicion by followers of the Way. At the same time this reminder of past offences against the target or their family is seen as a bonus in some parts of [[the Marches]], where the people have long memories. It also reminds the target of debts owed or owing; this gives it particular resonance with the [[The League culture and customs#Dead Reckoning|dead reckoning]] of [[the League]], and coincidentally ensures that the targets become aware of any debts they incur or that are incurred while under the influence of the enchantment.

The Autumn [[eternal|eternals]] known as the [[Lictors]] are not themselves directly invoked by this ritual, despite the fact that it delivers similar powers to those these creatures are said to wield. The Lictors hunt oath-breakers, and those who refuse to honour agreements, contracts or obligations. They are said to resemble hooded figures wrapped in heavy iron and [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] chains, with razor-sharp brass claws and horns, and iron face-masks. Armed with scourges, whips, flails, ropes and nets they stalk the dark places of the Autumn realm. According to some stories, they can be summoned to pursue, capture and punish those who have broken important oaths or refused to honour their debts.

## Common Elements
This ritual invokes powers of binding, capturing and punishment. It often includes instruments of restraint such as chains, ropes, nets and even ribbons. Targets may be wrapped in chains or ropes by the ritualists. Invocations of heroes, [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] whose stories include tracking, chasing and capturing fugitive (such as the paragon [[Vardas]]) are a common element. The rune [[Hirmok]] may be painted on the targets, and the trappings of judges, [[Imperial Orcs economic interests#Thief-takers|thief-takers]], bounty hunters and badgers may all be used. In [[the League]] it is common to place metal masks on the targets, or ask them to recite a list of debts they wish to collect. Similarly in [[the Marches]] a series of grudges might be recounted.

Tokens of [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] are often used in this ritual - even if the metal is not being used to empower the target directly  tokens made from these materials may be given to the targets.
