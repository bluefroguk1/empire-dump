## Description
A Burnished Rampart, sometimes called an ''Undying Shield'', a ''Brazen Shield'' or occasionally even an ''Orichalcum Shield'' is most often made of metal, with an [[Materials#iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] finish. The shield itself is difficult to destroy without the use of magic.  

It was first devised by the [[Wintermark_magical_traditions#Runesmiths|runesmiths]] of the [[Steinr]] to test the resolve of young warriors. Many cocky youngsters would claim that if only their shields had not been shattered by the hammers of the trolls, they would have held the line until their deaths. Tired of such boasting, a Runesmith named Thyra created the first Undying Shields and offered them such warriors, telling him that if true heroism burned in their souls, then such a shield would never fail them. Some were worthy of the shields' magic while some fled with little but splinters.

A Burnished Rampart may be engraved with the rune [[Pallas]], often inlaid in gold or a gold-[[Materials#orichalcum|orichalcum]] alloy. Some bearers will mark their shields with paint to show how often it had been broken and repaired, as a display of their determination and dedication to the Virtue of [[Pride]].


## Rules

* Effect: You may repair this shield by expending a [[Heroic skills#Hero Points|hero point]] and spending at least five seconds of uninterrupted [[appropriate roleplaying]] involving handling the item. If the shield is struck with a blow while using this ability, the blow is considered to have struck your arm as usual and you must begin the appropriate roleplaying again. If you are attacked or make an attack while using this ability the attempt fails and you must begin the roleplaying again.
* Materials: Crafting a Burnished Rampart requires fourteen ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and three measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
