The Synod will establish assemblies that each may know their virtue and select the most virtuous amongst them to lead.

## Overview
The [[judgement]] of appointment allows the Synod to choose a citizen to hold an Imperial title for a year or more. It is a standard method of appointment that forms one of the [[New_Imperial_titles#Well_Worn_Paths|well worn paths]] for election available to the Senate when they create a new Imperial title.

Each Imperial title that is appointed by the Synod specifies which [[assembly]] the title is appointed by. Any title that is re-elected annually will also specify when the election occurs. At the appropriate summit, any citizen who is eligible for the position may approach the [[Tribune of the Synod]] to indicate they wish to be considered for the title. The Tribune will then raise a judgement in the appropriate assembly asking the the Synod to judge the appointment.

## Judgement
A judgement of appointment may only be submitted by the Tribune. Candidates who wish to be considered for the position make themselves known to the Tribune. who will raise a judgement of appointment in the relevant assembly listing the candidates name. 

Once the judgement is submitted by the Tribune, any citizen who is eligible can have the Tribune add their name to the judgement. Members of the Synod may vote at any time, casting their votes for a single candidate named on the judgement. 

The Tribune will use their discretion to choose the appropriate deadline for the election, normally this will be 6pm on the second day of the summit, provided that the nominations begin on the Friday. A judgement of appointment is not subject to [[Cardinal#Further_Scrutiny|further scrutiny by the cardinals]]; the deadline for voting on a judgement raised by the Tribune may not be moved. Voting continues up to the deadline unless there is primacy or the civil service determines that a [[Judgement#Majority|greater majority]] has been achieved.

A candidate for appointment may withdraw at any time. If they are the only candidate for the title, then the judgement will be withdrawn. Any votes that are recorded for the candidate will not be counted (though Synod members may change their vote) . Votes cannot be transferred to another candidate.

If no nominee comes forward for a position, the Tribune will not raise a judgement of appointment for the position. The title will remain vacant until the Tribune is approached by an eligible candidate.

### Assembly
Each Imperial title that is appointed by the Synod specifies which [[assembly]] the title is appointed by and when a regular election should be scheduled for.

* Imperial positions can be appointed either by judgement of the [[Assembly of the Nine]] or by the [[General Assembly]].
* National positions are appointed by judgement of the relevant national assembly.
* Virtue positions are appointed by judgement of the relevant virtue assembly

### Eligibility
Candidates for most positions appointed by the Imperial Synod do not have to be a member of the Synod, a specific assembly or possess any relevant skills. The only restriction is that candidates for national positions must be members of the appropriate nation.

Eligibility for some Imperial titles is based on membership of a specific virtue assembly - for example you must be a member of the Assembly of Courage to be the [[Cardinal of Courage]]. The changes to how membership of a Virtue Assembly is determined (from dedication to the virtues [[Congregation#Downtime Options|preached]] to a [[congregation]]) do not change this requirement. That means that any citizen with a relevant title, such as Cardinal, would be removed from their position if they embraced a different Virtue in downtime.

### Titles with Votes
It is illegal to use any votes provided by a title during the appointment of that title. The onus lies on the title holder to inform the Tribune of their correct number of votes when voting for the appointment of any title they hold, otherwise they risk being prosecuted for [[List_of_Criminal_Offences#Crimes_against_the_Processes_of_the_State|subverting the agencies of state]] if the matter comes to light. This restriction applies regardless of whether the incumbent is seeking re-appointment and wishes to vote for a different candidate.
Having a beard doesn't make you wise.

## Outcome
A judgement of appointment does not need a greater majority to succeed - whichever candidate has the most votes wins. If two citizens are tied for votes, then nobody wins the election and a new judgement must be raised to appoint the title.

Once the election is confirmed, the Tribune will inform the Overseer of [[Imperial elections]] of the result and the winner assumes the prerogatives of their office.
