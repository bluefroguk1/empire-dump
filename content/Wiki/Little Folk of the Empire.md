A .pdf of the music and lyrics can be found [[:file:Little_Folk_of_the_Empire.pdf|here]].


Oh heroes of the Empire 
As your great deeds you do. 
Remember ye well the little folk
who work and fight for you

The virtuous priest of Highguard
His cleansing bell shall toll. 
With each new day he shows the way. 
He guards the Empire’s soul.

The bannerwoman of the Wintermark 
Her head held high and proud 
With strength of arm she weathers the storm 
Courageous and unbowed 

The Urizeni magus 
So subtle deep and wise 
Seeks without fail secrets to unveil 
Plucks knowledge from the skies 

The joyful Freeborn sailor 
The tiller firm in hand 
So bright and brave she skims the waves 
'Til she safely comes to land

The staunch and loyal Navarri 
They walk the trods so wide 
No soft warm bed to lay their head 
Their spear is by their side

The brave Varushkan Warden 
She bears a heavy load 
In broad daylight or gloom of night 
She watches over the roads

The glorious Dawnish noble 
Calls all to pay him heed 
Proclaims aloud, so clear and proud 
His great and mighty deeds

The orc in the hills of Skarsind 
Watching the clouds roll by 
See how she roams her newfound home 
As free as the wind and sky 

The Leaguer in their counting house 
Takes care of every ring 
And all can see the prosperity 
Their wise investments bring 

The Marcher in her garden 
Her hands deep in the soil 
She tills the fields and the land she heals 
With good and honest toil 

So heroes of the Empire 
As you march off to war 
Remember ye well the simple folk 
Who you are fighting for

(Optional) 
And I ask thee Imperatrix 
O patron of beauty and art 
The people of each land you hold in your hand 
Hold also in your heart.
