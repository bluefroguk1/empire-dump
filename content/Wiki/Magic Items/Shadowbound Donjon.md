## Description
A [[Shadowbound Donjon]] is traditionally crafted from wood harvested in the darkest part of a [[Forest|forest]]. The birchwood of [[Upwold]] is particularly prized for use when crafting this implement, although dark pinewood from [[Karov]] and aged oak from the depths of [[Semmerholm]] are equally valuable. Interestingly, wood taken from forests that have been touched by [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] seems to be especially difficult to shape into a [[Shadowbound Donjon]]. There is a suggestion that the vitality that infuses the area around these vegetable abominations has a lingering effect even after the entity's grasp on the [[Forest|forest]] has been broken, and that energy renders the wood less suitable for an [[Enchantment|enchantment]] that fixes living things in place.
When the power of the staff is invoked it locks the target into a conceptual prison, unable to move. Some wielders speak of a dimming of vision when the staff is invoked, as if they were wrapped in imprisoning shadows, although the targets rarely experience this phenomenon.
The staff is often inscribed with one of the [[Runes|runes]] [[Feresh]], which represents majesty; [[Aesh]], which can represent stability; or [[Hirmok]] the [[Rune]] of Dominion.
## Rules
Staffs
* Effect: Once per [[Day|day]] when you cast the [[Paralysis]] spell you can do so without spending any mana. You must be able to cast the [[Paralysis|paralysis]] spell to use this power.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Shadowbound Donjon requires five measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and three measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
