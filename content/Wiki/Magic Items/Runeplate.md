## Description
Each plate of this heavy armour is crafted from an alloy of [[Green iron|green iron]] and steel, repeatedly quenched in beggar's lye to cleanse unwanted impurities from the metal. The surface and fastenings are woven with [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] wire, with pieces of carefully shaped [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] used both as decoration and as backing for key pieces. The armour is usually marked with [[Runes|runes]], and a full traditional suit of [[Wintermark]] [[Runeplate]] bears each of the [[Runes]] somewhere on its surface, along with personal [[Runes|runes]] of significance to the smith and the intended wearer - these suits are almost always commissioned by a specific wearer. Crafting a complete suit is sometimes considered the pinnacle of the armour crafter's art.
[[Runeplate]] inspires the wearer, driving them to perform great deeds. Some wearers find merely wearing a suit to be very tiring; beyond the exhaustion caused by the weight of the armour there is a constant nagging need to ''do something''. It is not uncommon for a warrior to collapse after removing a suit of [[Runeplate]], emotionally wrung out by the experience. 
In [[Dawn]] [[Runeplate]] is sometimes called ''crusader's plate'' and in contrast to Elfin Guard tends to be sparsely decorated. A wearer of Dawnish crusader plate needs no beautiful decoration to prove their [[Glory|glory]], preferring to let their quality show through in their actions. 
In [[Highguard]] the armour is often called ''[[Cataphract|cataphract]]'s lorica'' and inscribed either with the specifically virtuous [[Runes|runes]] or without visible [[Runes|runes]] at all and instead with symbols of the imperial virtues. It is favoured by the cataphracts, but few [[Chapters|chapters]] can afford to maintain more than a single suit of this expensive and valuable harness.
