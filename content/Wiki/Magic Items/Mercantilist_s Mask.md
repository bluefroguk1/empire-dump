## Description
The Mercantilist's Mask provides the wearer with a greater understanding of the tides and rivers of wealth that flow through [[The Empire|the Empire]] and beyond; they learn to better manipulate such forces to benefit [[Business|business]]. It is rare for one of these masks not to incorporate a [[Wintermark]] [[Rune|rune]] - most often [[Pallas]] the Rune of Wealth. Some artisans make use of subtle [[Queros]] or serendipitous [[Ull]]. Outside [[Wintermark]], the rune is often inscribed on the interior of the mask, often in such a way that it [[Will|will]] rest just above the lips of the wearer.
These masks are seldom opulent or bejewelled, instead preferring a subtle touch of gold trim or silver inlay on a plain and well crafted base. Coins are an obvious motif to include when fashioning such an item; in [[The Brass Coast]] a popular form of this mask is a lower-face veil composed of two dozen ring coins bound together with [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] wires called (unsurprisingly) a ''Veil of Rings''. 
Fish are sometimes used - the scales of a fish can appear metallic, and they navigate literal tides in the same way the [[Magician|magician]] seeks to navigate metaphoric economic tides (as well as having obvious resonance with the [[Winds of Fortune]] [[Ritual|ritual]]). In [[Varushka]] the mask may be engraved with bees, but a mask in the shape of a squirrel may also work well with the [[Magic|magic]] employed (the squirrel is wise, but it also collects and stores nuts in a way that has obvious resonance to the behaviour of a business owner).
As with all the magical masks, these foci are used to grant additional power to perform ritual [[Magic|magic]]. In this case, the Mercantilist's Mask empowers the [[Streams of Silver]], [[Rivers of Gold]], and [[Winds of Fortune]] [[Rituals|rituals]]. All three [[Rituals|rituals]] deal with the accumulation of wealth; subtly nudging synchronicity to ensure a steady flow of coins into the pockets of a Business owner.
By itself, it [[Will|will]] allow even a novice [[Autumn|autumn]] ritualist to perform [[Streams of Silver]] without having mastered it and without the [[Assistance|assistance]] of a [[Coven|coven]]. It is sufficient to [[Empower|empower]] that simple ritual enough to let a ritualist add one or two additional businesses to a performance depending on the mastery of the wearer. It is not quite so impactful when used to perform [[Rivers of Gold]] or Winds of Fortune - in theory, it might allow a master of [[Autumn magic]] who is familiar with the ritual to perform it by themselves (perhaps one who has access to an appropriate [[Potion|potion]] or ritual staff). More likely it will help a coven gather sufficient power to perform the ritual with limited mastery, or enchant an additional business or [[Fleet|fleet]] that might otherwise be beyond their power with a single performance.
