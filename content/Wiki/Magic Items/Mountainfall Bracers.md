## Description
[[Mountainfall Bracers]] are usually made from sturdy material: [[Mithril]] alloys, shaped pieces of natural amber, or in some cases even pieces of carefUlly-smoothed stone. They are usually accompanied by a set of greaves in a similar style, and a pectoral, and the whole is often decorated with [[Ambergelt]] inlays. They tend to be heavy, and even a muscular magician often finds it difficult to undertake extended periods of exercise while wearing them. Many wearers complain that the [[Mage]] armour becomes a little heavier every time the [[Paralysis]] spell is cast with its Assistance, although they clEarly do not actually weigh more than they did when they were donned.
In [[Wintermark]] and [[The Marches]], Runesmiths and battle-magicians often practice Fighting with heavy weights attached to their wrists and ankles to prepare themselves for using this Mage armour. They also practice a discipline developed in [[Urizen]] in which they remain completely still for a short period of time and then perform a sudden action that stretches their muscles, unbalances them or the like. This technique allows a magician to take advantage of the paralysis they have inflicted on their opponent to do something surprising - to draw and strike with a sword, for example, when their enemy expects them to make another attack with their staff, or to move in an unexpected direction to keep their opponent off their guard. 
## Rules
