## Description
[[Mountainfall Bracers]] are usually made from sturdy material: [[Mithril|mithril]] alloys, shaped pieces of natural amber, or in some cases even pieces of carefully-smoothed stone. They are usually accompanied by a set of greaves in a similar style, and a pectoral, and the whole is often decorated with [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] inlays. They tend to be heavy, and even a muscular [[Magician|magician]] often finds it difficult to undertake extended periods of exercise while wearing them. Many wearers complain that the [[Mage|mage]] armour becomes a little heavier every time the [[Paralysis]] spell is cast with its [[Assistance|assistance]], although they clearly do not actually weigh more than they did when they were donned.
In [[Wintermark]] and [[The Marches|the Marches]], runesmiths and battle-magicians often practice fighting with heavy weights attached to their wrists and ankles to prepare themselves for using this [[Mage Armour|mage armour]]. They also practice a discipline developed in [[Urizen]] in which they remain completely still for a short period of time and then perform a sudden action that stretches their muscles, unbalances them or the like. This technique allows a magician to take advantage of the [[Paralysis|paralysis]] they have inflicted on their opponent to do something surprising - to draw and strike with a sword, for example, when their enemy expects them to make another attack with their staff, or to move in an unexpected direction to keep their opponent off their guard. 
## Rules
[[Mage]] Armour
* Effect: You may cast the Paralysis spell for 1 mana rather than 2 mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting [[Mountainfall Bracers]] requires fifteen measures of ambergelt, ten measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], nine measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]], eleven measures of beggar's lye and seven ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
