## Description
This smith's hammer is traditionally made with a stylised white head as if carved from a block of ice, a clear tribute to the Rime Hammer, the legendary tool that was created by [[Isenbrad]] centuries ago. The power of the [[Legacy]] echoes that of the Rime Hammer itself, though it lacks the potency of its forebear. Even so it is a powerful tool in the hands of an artisan allowing them to recreate Isenbrad's feats in which he would create a item of power in hours rather than the days or weeks it would normally take. 
It is often assumed that the Legacy was patterned after the Imperial ritual [[Timeless Hammer Rhythm]], a powerful [[Autumn magic]] that produces a similar effect. However Runesmiths claim the opposite is true - that the ritual was created by magicians who sought to imitate Isenbrad's hammer. Given how old a figure Isenbrad is, this is certainly possible.
Artisans who craft a Legacy are often divided on the shape and form the hammer should take. Some prefer to construct a blacksmith's hammer, something with the ideal weight and length for working an [[Anvil]], so that they can use the hammer in their regular work. Runesmiths who like to take [[The Battlefield]] often prefer to create a much bigger heavier hammer, so that it has the right heft to be used as weapon on the battlefield. 
## Rules
Tool
* Requirements: You must have the Artisan skill to bond to this item.
* Effect: Once per summit you may cast Timeless Hammer Rhythm on yourself as if you knew it without expending any mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting Isenbrad's Legacy requires seven ingots of Green Iron, seven ingots of Tempest Jade, four  ingots of Orichalcum, four ingots of Weltsilver and and six measures of beggar's lye. It takes one month to make one of these items.
Runesmith's Law
"Do you have one in stock? I need it now!"
Mildryd stared at the [[Imperial Orcs]], the irritation plain to see on her face. She'd been haggling with this woman over the price for what felt like an age. Only to discover at the last that the reaver apparently needed it ''now''.
"Now Costs extra." She said folding her arms over her chest. She was through being polite. She liked most of the Imperial Orcs who came this way from [[Skarsind]], but this one appeared to have left her manners at home. It didn't help that she kept stopping with a blank look on her face, and then she'd come back with a complete non-sequitur. The first time she'd done it, it was funny. After she'd done it a dozen times, the act was getting old.
"Extra? What do you mean extra? You either have one to sell or you don't? I can't wait for you to make one!"
"Now costs extra" Mildryd said again. She contemplated explaining the situation to her customer and then decided against it. She didn't owe this orc anything. "I could have made you one in the time you've spent haggling over 3 rings on the price. You want one. I'll make it - but it costs extra. 4 crowns extra."
"Four crowns! For something you've got in stock! That's out..." she trailed off. There was that blank look again. It was really starting to get on Mildryd's nerves. "Are you a child of the Half-Hand?" the orc suddenly asked.
Mildryd stared slack-jawed at the woman. She tried to think of something to say but she had no words.
"They say only a child of the Half-Hand can make this in a day" the orc insisted.
She ground her teeth. "Enough of your nonsense!" she shouted. "I have two hands, as you can plainly see. I've no idea who your Half-hand is - but I'm a Runesmith of [[Wintermark]] and I tell you I can make the armour you need. And I can do it in less time than we've spent arguing about the damn price. Enough haggling, enough arguing!" Her hand fell to her blacksmith's hammer hanging from her belt, the cool touch of the metal helping to calm her temper.
"If the price is too steep then get out and leave me to get on with my day." She grinned at the last waving the Legacy under his nose. "But if you want to see real [[Magic]], put your coin on the counter, take a seat and watch."
