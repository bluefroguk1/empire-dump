## Description
The most common form taken by a [[Ring of Adversity]] is either a single band marked with one each of the [[Runes]] of [[Spring]], [[Winter]] and [[Night]] or a single ring formed of three interwoven [[Bands|bands]], each of a different precious metal.
## Rules
Foci
* Effect: Once per [[Day|day]] you may use this ring to gain one additional rank of either Spring lore, Winter lore or Night lore for the purposes of performing a single [[Ritual|ritual]], subject to the normal rules for effective skill.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Ring of Adversity]] requires nine measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], nine measures of beggar's lye, six ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], and nine measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
Anushka squeezed her eyes tightly shut and threw the last of her power into a blast of magical force which slammed into the dark, ragged figure, throwing him off balance and onto the treacherous lip of rock overlooking the waterfall.  Close to collapse, she crawled towards him as he struggled to pull himself back from the brink.  Her scrabbling hand found only a rock as a weapon, and without thinking she raised it high and then slammed it down against the cadaverous skull of the filthy [[Volodny]] who had withered the crops of her village with his foul [[Magic|magic]].  The first blow knocked him insensible, his eyes rolling back in their sockets, but she kept on, hammering again and again with a furious strength she didn't even know she possessed.  When she finally came to her senses she was panting and covered in gore and bone, and the [[Volodny]] was as dead as any man could be.
Shakily, the young [[Volhov]] got to her feet and tried to clear some of the gore clinging to her face, but her caked hands only made it worse.  Grimacing, she reached for the dead [[Mage|mage]]'s robe to clean herself, and that was when she saw it.  About his finger was an exquisite ring, glistening with strands of magical metal and artistry.  Beautiful and powerful, she knew what it was as soon as she laid eyes on it.  
She teased [[The Ring|the ring]] from the Volodny's dead finger, grimacing at his long, filth-encrusted nails, and held it to the light.  Beautiful, powerful, but unwholesome; she could feel the hungers of Winter, the wild lusts of Spring and the whispered promises of Night as she held it in her hand.  To repair the damage the Volodny had done, she would need more power than she currently possessed.  [[The Ring|The ring]] promised it would be hers, along with so much more.
She slipped it into a pocket, telling herself that she didn't need to decide now, but in her heart she knew the decision had already been made.
