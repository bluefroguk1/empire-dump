## Description
The ''Yeoman's Bounty'' is a serviceable rod usually made of wood from the yew tree (a tree associated with burial grounds), engraved with [[Runes]] such as [[Kyrop]], the [[Rune|rune]] of [[Weakness|weakness]]. . It is sometimes called a ''Lover's Grave'', a ''Last-ditch Baton'' or occasionally a ''Weapon of Last Resort'' - all references to [[The Way|the way]] that invoking its [[Magic|magic]] prevents a [[Magician|magician]] from performing any further [[Magic|magic]] until the repercussions of doing so are alleviated. Many magicians would sooner cast this spell through this rod than learn it themselves because they find learning to sever themselves from the source of their power unsettling, especially if they derive great [[Pride]] from their magical prowess. Using the rod is occasionally frowned upon in [[Dawn]] since the [[Weakness]] spell can be seen as reducing the [[Glory]] of a battle by robbing an opponent of their most impressive abilities.
[[Wintermark]] magicians who become Frayed occasionally arm themselves with these rods and seek out powerful [[Barbarian|barbarian]] [[Shamans|shamans]] and warlords during battle to strike down with it, as an act of self-sacrifice. This tactic, and the rod itself, are sometimes known as ''Mouse's Bite'', as a weak or civilian magician robs a much more potent foe of their might. Obviously such gambits are extremely dangerous for the magician in question, thus acquiring and bonding to this rod is sometimes taken as a sign of despair or desperation by close confidantes, but also a display of [[Courage]]. 
Another unfavourable association with this rod is its usage in thefts and muggings, where a weaker member of the gang [[Will|will]] begin by using the rod against a wealthy, well-equipped target before their colleagues subdue and rob the victim. Some of the more notorious [[Bands|bands]] of bandits lurking in [[The Barrens]] employ these rods against the noble-born Questing knights who wear their wealth of their order.

"The Yeoman's Bounty he did claim
An aching back his treasure
To toil relentless was his aim
No rest, respite or leisure
In blazing sun and driving rain
He sowed and ploughed and scattered
His every muscle felt the strain
But his [[Will|will]] was never shattered.
A Prouder man you [[Will|will]] never meet;
[[Prosperity]] defines him
[[Ambition]] guides his aching feet
And [[Vigilance]] stands behind him
The [[Wisdom]] of the land he knows
His [[Loyalty]] never does waver
The [[Courage]] of a Yeoman true
Is the Bounty he must savour.
