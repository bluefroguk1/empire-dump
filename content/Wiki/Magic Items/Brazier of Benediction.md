## Description
These talismans may consist of anything from a simple earthenware bowl or fire pots to an intricately carved silver or gold vessel. Also known as a ''[[Censer of Benediction]]'', this is a religious talisman used to offer additional potency to ceremonies of [[Consecration|consecration]]. At its most basic it takes the form of a vessel used for [[Burning|burning]] incense or aromatic [[Herbs|herbs]] as part of a ceremony. Generally the [[Liao]] used as part of the [[Consecration|consecration]] is added to the material burnt in the item and the resultant fumes inhaled - some [[Mystics|mystics]] [[Will|will]] also pour any [[Potion|potion]] they are using into the flames.
A priest who uses one of these handy talismans is able to create - or remove - significantly more durable auras than normal by using additional [[Liao|liao]]. In [[Highguard]] and [[Urizen]] particularly, one of these items may be called a ''Brazier of Purification'', partially in reference to the idea of filling an area with "pure" virtuous power but also in reference to its usefulness in dismantling corrupt or malign auras that may have infused an area. Some specialist Stewards of the Dead combine this regalia with a suitable vestment, such as a [[Wayfarer]]'s Robe, allowing them to cleanse haunted areas of extremely potent malignancies.
As with almost all priestly regalia, a [[Brazier of Benediction]] is often hallowed with an [[Aura|aura]] that helps the priest to fulfil their chosen role. Popular choices include all those hallows which encourage a priest to rouse, recruit, exalt, or [[Empower|empower]] other people in the name of Virtue.
## Rules
Regalia
* Effect: When you perform or cooperate with the performance of the Consecration skill, you may spend up to three additional doses of Liao to increase the strength of the ceremony by the same amount.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Brazier of Benediction]] requires five measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], five ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]], three ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]], and five measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
