## Description
These talismans may consist of anything from a simple earthenware bowl or fire pots to an intricately carved silver or gold vessel. Also known as a ''Censer of Benediction'', this is a religious talisman used to offer additional potency to ceremonies of [[Religious skills#Consecrate|consecration]]. At its most basic it takes the form of a vessel used for burning incense or aromatic herbs as part of a ceremony. Generally the [[Liao]] used as part of the consecration is added to the material burnt in the item and the resultant fumes inhaled - some mystics will also pour any [[Tisanes of the Labyrinth|potion]] they are using into the flames.
A priest who uses one of these handy talismans is able to create - or remove - significantly more durable auras than normal by using additional liao. In [[Highguard]] and [[Urizen]] particularly, one of these items may be called a ''Brazier of Purification'', partially in reference to the idea of filling an area with "pure" virtuous power but also in reference to its usefulness in dismantling corrupt or malign auras that may have infused an area. Some specialist [[Highguard religious beliefs#Stewards of the dead|Stewards of the Dead]] combine this regalia with a suitable [[:Category:Vestments|vestment]], such as a [[Wayfarer's Robe]], allowing them to cleanse haunted areas of extremely potent malignancies.
As with almost all priestly regalia, a [[Brazier of Benediction]] is often [[Hallow|hallowed]] with an aura that helps the priest to fulfil their chosen role. Popular choices include all those hallows which encourage a priest to rouse, recruit, exalt, or empower other people in the name of Virtue.
## Rules
Regalia
* Effect: When you [[Religious skills#Performing a Ceremony|perform]] or [[Religious skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with the performance of the [[Consecration]] skill, you may spend up to three additional doses of [[Liao]] to increase the [[Religious skills#Ceremony Strength|strength]] of the ceremony by the same amount.
* Materials: Crafting a [[Brazier of Benediction]] requires five measures of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]], five ingots of [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]], three ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], and five measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
