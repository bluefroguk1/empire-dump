## Description
As with other [[:Category:Icons|icons]], this ceremonial tool allows a priest to perform a [[Liao]] ceremony. These icons often bear images of paragons and exemplars who defended people against false virtues, corrupt individuals or supernatural threats. They take their name from a title given to some exorcists in the pre-Imperial history of the Brass Coast, who specialised in driving out malign spirits or cleansing unpleasant auras from people, places and objects. 
An [[Icon of the Justicar|icon of the justicar]] is the fruit of months of work for a skilled [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]]. The work often includes small amounts of the magical [[Materials|materials]], and it is very common for a crafter to use tools inlaid with [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] when working on an icon. In many parts of the Empire they are crafted to resemble torches or braziers, or may actually be censers used to burn strong-smelling materials. In some parts of [[Varushka]] they are commonly created in the shape of sturdy metal candlesticks, in which beeswax candles are burnt during exorcism ceremonies.
