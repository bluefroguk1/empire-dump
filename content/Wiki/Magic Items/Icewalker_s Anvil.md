## Description
The Icewalker's [[Anvil]] is a useful talisman useful to the ritual Magicians of [[Wintermark]]. The schema was purchased from the [[Eternal]] [[Estavus]] as part of her offer to the mediators of Wintermark. Originally known as the ''Dripping Ring'' the focus was renamed by the [[Suaq]] Ã†thwin who passed the schema to Sulkavaris to be added to Runesmith's Law.
## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you can use one personal mana as if it were crystal mana when casting a ritual.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting the Icewalker's Anvil requires four ingots of Tempest jade and three measures of [[Iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
