## Description
These powerful weapons are favoured by battle magicians across [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Whether being used by a Highborn [[Magister]] to smash through a defensive battle line alongside the cataphracts, or hurling a chosen target  or employed by a [[Thresher|thresher]] to separate an enemy sorcerer from her allies, a [[Stormweaver]] is a clear sign of a [[Magician|magician]] who appreciates the potent control offered by the [[Repel]] spell.
The only drawback to a [[Stormweaver]] - and it is very slight - is that the rod seems to attract storms. On land this generally leads to slightly heavier rainfall, or the occasional unpleasant gale. At sea, it can be life-threatening. Very few ship's captains [[Will|will]] allow a [[Stormweaver]] aboard, especially on a ship sailing out of sight of land. The exception are the most adventurous [[Freeborn]] corsairs or [[Steinr]] merchant-[[Traders|traders]], who often welcome the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] for excitement an unexpected, magically enhanced, storm can offer.
## Rules
Rods
* Effect: Three times per [[Day|day]] you can cast the [[Repel]] spell as if you knew it and without expending any mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Stormweaver]] requires eight ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], seven measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], and three  measures of beggar's lye. It takes one month to make one of these items.
