## Description
These powerful weapons are favoured by battle Magicians across [[The Empire]]. Whether being used by a Highborn [[Magister]] to smash through a defensive battle line alongside the cataphracts, or hurling a chosen target  or employed by a [[Thresher]] to separate an enemy sorcerer from her allies, a [[Stormweaver]] is a clear sign of a magician who appreciates the potent control offered by the [[Repel]] spell.
The only drawback to a Stormweaver - and it is very slight - is that the rod seems to attract storms. On land this Generally leads to slightly heavier rainfall, or the occasional unpleasant gale. At sea, it can be life-threatening. Very few ship's captains will allow a Stormweaver aboard, especially on a ship sailing out of sight of land. The exception are the most adventurous Freeborn Corsairs or [[Steinr]] merchant-traders, who often welcome the [[Opportunity]] for excitement an unexpected, magically enhanced, storm can offer.
## Rules
Rods
* Effect: Three times per day you can cast the Repel spell as if you knew it and without expending any mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Stormweaver requires eight ingots of tempest jade, seven measures of [[Iridescent gloaming]], and three  measures of beggar's lye. It takes one month to make one of these items.
