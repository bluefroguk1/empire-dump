Title: Stormweaver
---
## Description
These powerful weapons are favoured by battle magicians across the Empire. Whether being used by a [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[Magister]] to smash through a defensive battle line alongside the [[Highguard Military Concerns|cataphracts]], or hurling a chosen target  or employed by a [[The Marches magical traditions#Threshers|thresher]] to separate an enemy sorcerer from her allies, a [[Stormweaver]] is a clear sign of a magician who appreciates the potent control offered by the [[Repel]] spell.
The only drawback to a [[Stormweaver]] - and it is very slight - is that the rod seems to attract storms. On land this generally leads to slightly heavier rainfall, or the occasional unpleasant gale. At sea, it can be life-threatening. Very few ship's captains will allow a [[Stormweaver]] aboard, especially on a ship sailing out of sight of land. The exception are the most adventurous [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] [[Corsair|corsairs]] or [[Steinr]] merchant-traders, who often welcome the opportunity for excitement an unexpected, magically enhanced, storm can offer.
## Rules
Rods
* Effect: Three times per day you can cast the [[Repel]] spell as if you knew it and without expending any mana.
* Materials: Crafting a Stormweaver requires eight ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], seven measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], and three  measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
