## Description
An [[Icon of the Industrious]] allows a priest to perform ceremonies as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Prosperity]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a [[Paragon|paragon]] or exemplar of [[Prosperity]] such as [[Zemress]] or [[The Little Mother|the Little Mother]]. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of a magpie, and known as an ''Icon of the Magpie''. Often these icons bear the [[Rune]] of Wealth, but they are equally as likely to bear the Rune of Victory. While [[Pallas]] is traditionally associated with Prosperity, the idea that [[Tykonus]] - which represents struggle and success more than mere wealth and material possessions - is a better fit has gained some purchase in recent decades. In [[Varushka]] it often takes the form of a statuette of bees surrounding a hive, and is known as a ''Hive of Industry''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - such as the colourful illuminated scrolls recounting the lives of the exemplars popular in [[The Brass Coast]].  
This Icon is especially popular in [[The Marches|the Marches]]. While all the Virtues are recognised and celebrated, many Marchers feel a strong connection to Prosperity. These Icons are often given more down-to-earth names by Marcher priests and lay folk and it is more common to hear talk of an ''Icon of the Exhausted'', ''Icon of the Aching'', or ''Icon of the Sweated Brow'' than it is an [[Icon of the Industrious]]. A particularly Marcher form of this icon is that of a carefully braided cord, often decorated with tiny silver charms or drops of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], used to cinch up a handful of corn or wheat stalks to create a ''Prosperous Sheaf''.
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Prosperity|auras of Prosperity]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to Prosperity who are not part of their [[Sect|sect]].
