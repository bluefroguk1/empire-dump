## Description
The covenstone known as [[The Iron Labyrinth]] draws upon the Realm of Autumn to empower a coven with additional capacity for performing rituals, drawing upon the bonds created between members of the coven.
These items are usually finely crafted to appear like a miniature city crafted of gleaming metal and often exhibit [[Queros]], rune of plots and [[Hirmok]], rune of dominion.
