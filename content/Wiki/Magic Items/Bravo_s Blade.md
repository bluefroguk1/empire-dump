## Description
The [[Bravo]]’s Blade is a savage weapon, capable of inflicting devastating damage on an opponent. It is said that even those not from the [[Free Companies]] develop the [[Bravo|bravo]] swagger with one of these swords on their belt. However, [[Bravos|bravos]] themselves are unlikely to draw one of these blades in one of their all-to-common tavern brawls because [[The Blade|the blade]] is too lethal. This has led to the belief among warriors in other nations that a [[Bravo|bravo]] only draws such a blade to kill – a story the bravos themselves only encourage!
There are tales in [[Sarvos]] of an infamous [[Mage|mage]]-assassin who wielded a [[Bravo]]’s Blade and rod. They first cast the [[Venom]] spell then followed up with a blow from the [[Bravo]]’s Blade. The assassin wore a mask and was never identified, and became known as the Maledict, from the [[Potion|potion]] bottle left behind at the scene of every crime.
In some Varushkan histories the tyrant-[[Boyar|boyar]] [[Alderei the Fair]] was said to have wielded an artefact-quality blackened sword with the properties of a Bravo’s Blade. This had led some [[Schlacta|schlacta]] to believe that they should never follow a commander that bears a Bravo’s Blade, lest they play some part in the return of the dark king. This, of course, does not stop them being popular in [[Varushka]]. They are particularly valued among the wardens.

The heavy set Yeofolk thumped after me. They were all trussed up in heavy leathers and light [[Mithril|mithril]] chain hauberks. There were five of them and one of me.
“Pay up, you was cheating us” said one of their big dirty faces.
I reached the end of the alley. I’d taken a wrong turn. It was a dead end.
“Now, now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure we can settle this reasonably. All I was doing was winning,” I replied and gave them one of my finest smiles.
“Yeah,” they said while brandishing heavy cudgels and wicked looking daggers “with these.”
Now normally I could have taken all eight of them, but I was wearing my best dress and I didn’t want to get too much muck on it. I drew my blade. The tempest jade foil glistened in the moonlight. I gave them my award-winning smile again.
“Well then, en garde,” I held the thin rapier out towards the brutes, even in the half light they could see what it was.
They took a step back, one ran and then they all ran. One tripped and fell into the gutter. I swear on my rings he wet himself. I kicked him in the ribs for good measure and left for the next tavern.
Now how about that drink you owe me?
