## Description
The [[Bravo]]’s Blade is a savage weapon, capable of inflicting devastating daMage on an opponent. It is said that even those not from the Free Companies develop the bravo swagger with one of these swords on their belt. However, bravos themselves are unlikely to draw one of these blades in one of their all-to-common tavern brawls because [[The Blade]] is too lethal. This has led to the belief among Warriors in other nations that a bravo only draws such a blade to kill – a story the bravos themselves only enCourage!
There are tales in [[Sarvos]] of an infamous [[Mage]]-assassin who wielded a Bravo’s Blade and rod. They first cast the [[Venom]] spell then followed up with a blow from the Bravo’s Blade. The assassin wore a mask and was never identified, and became known as the Maledict, from the [[Potion]] bottle left behind at the scene of every crime.
In some Varushkan histories the tyrant-boyar [[Alderei the Fair]] was said to have wielded an artefact-quality blackened sword with the properties of a Bravo’s Blade. This had led some schlacta to believe that they should never follow a commander that bears a Bravo’s Blade, lest they play some part in the return of the dark king. This, of course, does not stop them being popular in [[Varushka]]. They are particularly valued among the Wardens.

The heavy set Yeofolk thumped after me. They were all trussed up in heavy leathers and light [[Mithril]] chain hauberks. There were five of them and one of me.
“Pay up, you was cheating us” said one of their big dirty faces.
I reached the end of the alley. I’d taken a wrong turn. It was a dead end.
“Now, now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure we can settle this reasonably. All I was doing was winning,” I replied and gave them one of my finest smiles.
“Yeah,” they said while Brandishing heavy cudgels and wicked looking daggers “with these.”
Now normally I could have taken all eight of them, but I was wearing my best dress and I didn’t want to get too much muck on it. I drew my blade. The tempest jade foil glistened in the moonlight. I gave them my award-winning smile again.
“Well then, en garde,” I held the thin rapier out towards the brutes, even in the half light they could see what it was.
They took a step back, one ran and then they all ran. One tripped and fell into the gutter. I swear on my rings he wet himself. I kicked him in the ribs for good measure and left for the next tavern.
Now how about that drink you owe me?
