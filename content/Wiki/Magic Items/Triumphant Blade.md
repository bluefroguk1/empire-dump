## Description
A [[Triumphant Blade]] is a popular [[Enchanted]] weapon, used throughout [[The Empire]] in various forms. A heroic individual may enhance their reservoir of inner strength directly, but with a little effort anyone can benefit from the fire the weapon kindles in their soul. In addition to allowing even the meekest [[Senator]] to stand firm in the face of [[Malign Spiritual Presences]], it is sometimes coupled with other enchanted items such as Scrivener's Guard to serve as a Mystical 'power source' for the second item.
A Dawnish Triumphant Blade often bears the rune [[Tykonus]], while a Winterfolk-forged axe or sword is just as likely to bear [[Gralm]] or [[Ull]], the [[Runes]] associated with fate and chance. In [[Varushka]], a ''Schlacta's Axe'' is a popular weapon bought by rich boyars for their favoured captains, while the Freeborn and officers of the Free Companies of [[The League]] alike are known to favour beautifully crafted and decorated Triumphant Blades as marks of office.
