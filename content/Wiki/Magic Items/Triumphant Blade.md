## Description
A [[Triumphant Blade]] is a popular [[Enchanted|enchanted]] weapon, used throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]] in various forms. A heroic individual may enhance their reservoir of inner strength directly, but with a little effort anyone can benefit from the fire the weapon kindles in their soul. In addition to allowing even the meekest [[Senator|senator]] to stand firm in the face of [[Malign Spiritual Presences|malign spiritual presences]], it is sometimes coupled with other [[Enchanted|enchanted]] items such as [[Scrivener]]'s Guard to serve as a mystical 'power source' for the second item.
A Dawnish [[Triumphant Blade]] often bears the [[Rune|rune]] [[Tykonus]], while a Winterfolk-forged axe or sword is just as likely to bear [[Gralm]] or [[Ull]], the [[Runes|runes]] associated with fate and chance. In [[Varushka]], a ''[[Schlacta]]'s Axe'' is a popular weapon bought by rich boyars for their favoured captains, while the [[Freeborn]] and officers of the [[Free Companies]] of [[The League|the League]] alike are known to favour beautifully crafted and decorated Triumphant Blades as marks of office.
