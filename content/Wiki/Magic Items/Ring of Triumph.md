From an original printed manuscript of "The Beggar of the Twin Towns" by Ferdinand de Tassato.
Margrave Liutswind raises her fist in defiance, the ring prominently displayed to the audience and to Margrave Luitpold.
Luitpold: Ah, but that is not the ring you think it is dear Sister for I took that one from you last night while you slept.
Liutswind: No dear Brother, you are wrong - for it was your wife who swapped the rings the day before for me and it was you who gave me back my Triumph and with it granted me your DESTRUCTION!

Ring - flash with BIG gem. Use the Urizen rig to focus on it. I want to blind the audience so we can then drop Andrea in on the harness.
