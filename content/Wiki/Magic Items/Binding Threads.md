## Description
The [[Binding Threads]] are a weapon and an implement infused with magical power that allows the wielder to root an opponent to the spot. Their use is often accompanied with a great roar. Some wielders make a point of striking the opponent with both the weapon and the implement (usually a rod) simultaneously when they employ its [[Magic|magic]]. 
They are a popular choice with warrior-magicians who work with Imperial [[Magistrates|magistrates]], as well as with a number of wardens and Dawnish [[War|war]] witches who especially appreciate the ability to keep a fast moving or fleeing opponent in place where they and their allies can get to it.
## Rules
Arcane Weapons
* Effect: You may spend a hero point to call [[Entangle|ENTANGLE]] when you hit with this weapon or implement. You cannot use this ability if you are wearing armour.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting the [[Binding Threads]] requires seven measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]], seven measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and three ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]]. It takes one month to make a pair of these items.
[[Tassato]] was crowded, every street awash with revellers, and two brightly costumed actors were taking wine at a street table. 
"So: your rod and blade lose their [[Enchantment|enchantment]] in...."
"A week. Made just after the festival last year. And yours?"
"Two months. And between us we have?"
"36 rings and two measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]]."
"Not the seven of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], and [[Prosperity]] knows how much dragonbone we need then?"
"No. Nor the three ingots of green iron..."
"That presents a problem..."
"Indeed." 
An [[Apothecary|apothecary]]'s shop, some minutes later.
"My good man, we are but humble actors, who leaven our poor work with minor magics. The leader of our humble [[Troupe|troupe]] was mortified when a critic accused us of wallowing in the third act of "[[The Captain]], [[The Chamber|the Chamber]] and [[The Coin|the Coin]]"  Wallowing! [[Pride]] damn him! A little short of pace perhaps, but the needs of the [[Magic|magic]]... Hearing this,  our director flew into such a fury, and sent us out into the busy street to fetch such fine [[Materials|materials]] as are required for a Mantle of [[The Mountebank|the Mountebank]]."
"A what?" 
"You have not heard of it? Why, the most useful of robes for such as ourselves! Once we fetch our wardrobe mistress the requisites she'll run one up in a month, and our Captain's penultimate speech [[Will|will]] be a mere minute! Not the two he needs now... Why, the improvement to the scene [[Will|will]] be immeasurable!"
"I have not. I'll check, but I have not..."
The apothecary turned and reached for a heavy book, the collected notes of years of study of the craft, and rumours and tales gathered from artisans across Empire.
"No, there's no mention of such a... Ah."
A sharp pain at his kidney, the trademan froze.
"Indeed... Robbery. We may not be actors, but our need is just as great as some crass ham caught butchering a classic. You'll excuse the affront, I hope?"
"Perhaps no masks to be worn in your shop in future? Or may I advise retaining the services of a [[Bravo|bravo]]?" added the other, as he emptied the contents of small drawers, bowls and bags into a sack.
[[The Door|The door]] shook with three hammering blows as a long-haired woman in the hood of an Imperial [[Thief-taker|thief-taker]] crashed in.
"Halt in the name of [[The Empire|the Empire]]!"
"Really? Or [[Will|will]] it be you who halts..." said one of the robbers as he took guard. 
Thrust and parry, riposte and beat. Glassware crashed to the floor and tables of stock were over-turned as the two circled and probed.  In a flurry of blows, the advantage of short blade and rod versus long sword in a confined space was clear. With a final balestra and lunge, the [[Thief-taker|thief-taker]]'s defences were pierced. She stood rooted to the spot, blood oozing from her shoulder.
"Murder is such a foul word, and its penalty so severe... But that's simply a scratch, and with a lead of ten heartbeats? I doubt you'll catch us..."
The other booted the back door of the shop, and the pair were away...
An alleyway, shortly afterwards
Panting a little, the pair removed their masks and stripped off their gaudy outer garments, revealing serviceable leathers underneath. Emptying the sack onto the alley-floor, one counted measures and ingots, while the other unfolded cloaks.
"Do you know, that feels better already. Back to our true selves. Time for a holiday, I believe. Some Company [[Will|will]] be hiring, of a certainty. Shall we to a low tavern, the sort frequented by fighters and those who like to think of themselves as such?"
"To start a [[Fight|fight]], and see who's watching?"
"Indubitably."
"The Cozido?"
"Indeed!"
