## Description
Crafted from pieces of pale leather, or from thick padded cloth, with weltsilver fastenings, a jacket of winter's breath provides emergency protection on [[The Battlefield]]. When far from help, more than one wearer has been saved from a cold, lonely death by the burst of energy this armour provides. Some artisans insist that the best suits of winter's breath are crafted at the end of winter, soaked in snowmelt so that they are infused with the promise of the thaw. The harsher the preceding winter, they say, the more powerful the resulting armour.
It is said that the first five-hundred Winter’s Breath was made by [[Sermersuaq]] for her human children from the skins of her drowned children that became seals. [[Suaq]] seal hunters believe it is good luck to wear a seal-skin padded leather Winter’s Breath. These are often [[Painted]] with designs of swimming seals and the [[Runes]]: [[Lann]], the rune of bargains, and [[Xun]], the rune of transformations, representing the tale of the Sermersuaq’s children. Therefore they are often referred to as “Seal Coats” or "Mother’s Coats” among the Suaq. The latter makes them popular gifts from parent to child.
The Freeborn live in Warmer climes and thus have less need of protection from the cold, and thus name this item the “Rainbow Coat”. It is traditionally made of 30 layers of silk, the wealthy dye each layer a different colour, with the outer and inner layers being heavily embroidered with weltsilver thread and [[Ambergelt]] beads. It is popular among Corsairs, as they are able to swim in it should they fall overboard . However should anyone die while wearing a Rainbow Coat then it is considered unlucky to handle, let alone wear. Often a [[Hakima]] will ritually cleanse the item before it is burned by a [[Sutannir]] who knows the rite of [[Exorcism]].
## Rules

“Suvi, don’t leave the cottage Without Your Seal Coat.”
“But, ‘’Mother,’’ I don’t need it. I’ve passed my warrior test now. I’m taking my spear out hunting. I’ll be fine.”
“Now your father stayed at home every night for a month sewing that Coat for you and I hunted those seals for you myself. Even your little brother helped with the painting.”
“I know he helped. That’s why it looks more like a [[Horse]] than a seal.”
“I know you are very brave, but [[The Empire]] can’t be defended by [[Heroes]] who are frozen to death on the Tsirku. Save your bravery for when you need it, my puffin.”
“Ugh, fine, I’ll be back in a couple of days. I’m off with Eawyn and Tostig. There is a pod of beluga out in the bay.”
“Okay, remember to take Thane Raygada her share when you get back.”
“Of course, ‘Mother’, what do you think I am, a Maggot?”
“Of course not, dear, now off you go.”
