## Description
Crafted from pieces of pale leather, or from thick padded cloth, with [[Materials#weltsilver|weltsilver]] fastenings, a jacket of winter's breath provides emergency protection on the battlefield. When far from help, more than one wearer has been saved from a cold, lonely death by the burst of energy this armour provides. Some [[Crafting skills#artisan|artisans]] insist that the best suits of winter's breath are crafted at the end of winter, soaked in snowmelt so that they are infused with the promise of the thaw. The harsher the preceding winter, they say, the more powerful the resulting armour.
It is said that the first five-hundred Winter’s Breath was made by [[Wintermark territories#Sermersuaq|Sermersuaq]] for her human children from the skins of her drowned children that became seals. [[Suaq]] seal hunters believe it is [[Wintermark hearth magic#Animals and masks|good luck]] to wear a seal-skin padded leather Winter’s Breath. These are often painted with designs of swimming seals and the [[Runes]]: [[Lann]], the rune of bargains, and [[Xun]], the rune of transformations, representing the tale of the Sermersuaq’s children. Therefore they are often referred to as “Seal Coats” or "Mother’s Coats” among the Suaq. The latter makes them popular gifts from parent to child.
The [[Freeborn]] live in warmer climes and thus have less need of protection from the cold, and thus name this item the “Rainbow Coat”. It is traditionally made of 30 layers of silk, the wealthy dye each layer a different colour, with the outer and inner layers being heavily embroidered with weltsilver thread and [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]] beads. It is popular among [[Corsair|corsairs]], as they are able to swim in it should they fall overboard . However should anyone die while wearing a Rainbow Coat then it is considered [[The Brass Coast hearth magic#Clothing|unlucky]] to handle, let alone wear. Often a [[Hakima]] will ritually cleanse the item before it is burned by a [[Sutannir]] who knows the rite of [[Religious skills#Exorcism|Exorcism]].

“Suvi, don’t leave the cottage without your Seal Coat.”
“But, ‘’Mother,’’ I don’t need it. I’ve passed my warrior test now. I’m taking my spear out hunting. I’ll be fine.”
“Now your father stayed at home every night for a month sewing that Coat for you and I hunted those seals for you myself. Even your little brother helped with the painting.”
“I know he helped. That’s why it looks more like a horse than a seal.”
“I know you are very brave, but the Empire can’t be defended by heroes who are frozen to death on the Tsirku. Save your bravery for when you need it, my puffin.”
“Ugh, fine, I’ll be back in a couple of days. I’m off with Eawyn and Tostig. There is a pod of beluga out in the bay.”
“Okay, remember to take Thane Raygada her share when you get back.”
“Of course, ‘Mother’, what do you think I am, a Maggot?”
“Of course not, dear, now off you go.”
