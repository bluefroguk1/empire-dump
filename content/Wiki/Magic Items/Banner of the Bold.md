## Description
The intricate needlework required to embroider a [[Banner of the Bold|banner of the bold]] is time consuming in the extreme. Trace amounts of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] are used to trim and reinforce the sturdy cloth of the standard, but it is the intricate designs worked into the fabric itself that provide most of the [[Magic|magic]].
