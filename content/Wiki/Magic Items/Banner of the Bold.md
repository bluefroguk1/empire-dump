## Description
The intricate needlework required to embroider a [[Banner of the Bold]] is time consuming in the extreme.

The true potency of this banner becomes clear when the bearer is exposed to malignant Auras such as those produced by some horrors or Eternals, evoked by heretics and blasphemers, or brought into being by enemies of [[The Empire]] to protect key areas.
As with most magical banners, a banner of the bold bears the appropriate symbols for the heraldry or livery of the soldiers who will [[Fight]] beneath it.
