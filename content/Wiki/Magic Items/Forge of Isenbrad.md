## Description
[[Isenbrad]], [[Paragons and Exemplars|Paragon]] of [[Wisdom#The Path of Wisdom|Wisdom]], is a legendary smith said to have been so skilful he was able to craft weapons and armour from ice and snow. This sturdy [[Weapons & Armour#Mage Armour|Mage Armour]] allows a magician to repair broken items quickly and efficiently. 
It finds greatest favour among shield-bearing magicians, particularly in [[Highguard]], [[Dawn]] and among the [[Imperial Orcs]], who can make up for their light armour with a shield that is very hard to destroy. While [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#warcasters|warcasters]] appreciate the practical benefits of this armour, it is the [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#Oathwrights|Oathwrights]] who are utterly fascinated by its implications. They ponder what it means for a soul to be able to reshape items by channelling the power of the bond through the enchantment upon the armour. They are often cautious about the use of this armour, fearing that bonding to unsuitable items would be even more dangerous while wearing it.
These useful suits of mage armour are commonly pale in colour, and almost always bound with the [[Runes]] - [[Irremais]], the rune of wisdom, [[Pallas]], the rune of wealth and [[Feresh]], the rune of majesty. A [[Redsteel Chisel]] is considered an excellent companion to this armour and they are occasionally made as sets by those who wish a reputation as an artisan’s artisan.
## Rules
Mage Armour
* Effect: When you [[Spellcasting#Swift Casting|swift cast]] the [[Mend]] spell, you need only spend 1 mana rather than the usual 2 mana.
* Materials: Crafting a [[Forge of Isenbrad]] requires fifteen ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], eleven measures of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]], nine measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], and six ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
The immense beast crashed through the Imperial lines, bellowing and flailing as it went. Wherever one of its immense limbs swung through the air with all the finesse and gentleness of a tree-trunk, soldiers were smashed to the ground and weapons shattered. Even strikes against its stony hide left edges dulled and spears splintered.
But Tarquinius could see that the lumbering behemoth was just a spearhead; its clumsy assault served to break the line but, through the smoke and mayhem of the battlefield, the Sentinel could see a wedge of barbarians storming forward in its wake.
The moronic beast was still just driving forwards like a rudderless ship. It ploughed through the other side of the lines and kept on towards the woods, howling its fury and its pain. It had done what its handlers wanted, forging a vulnerability in the battle-formation that the barbarians would now exploit.
So Tarquinius plunged forwards amidst the soldiers. “They come!” he roared as he forced his way to the front. “They come! Form yourselves back up! Make ready for an assault!”
But many of the warriors were clutching at splintered hafts or broken blades after the behemoth's attack, and uncertainty flickered across their faces as they saw the barbarian troops rushing across the battlefield towards them.
Tarquinius reached out for the nearest soldier's ruined sword, scooped the shattered blade from the earth and shouted the incantation as he slammed the pieces back together. They sealed into one piece with a flare of magic, and then he simply twisted the bent blade back into shape as he continued to chant.
That done, he shoved the thankful soldier back towards the front, then turned to the next; this time a woman clutching pieces of spear. A handful of dirt in one hand, Tarquinius bound the splinters together with spatters of earth, then once again his incantations forged the weapon anew into one solid whole.
On and on he went, forging the broken weapons of the Imperials back together until his throat was hoarse with the chanting, his soul empty of power, his pouch of crystals now held no more than dust and broken fragments. But in that minute, a dozen more Imperials now stood ready to meet the enemy rather than flee with shattered blades.
And a dozen more could make all the difference.
Through the dust and the confusion came the barbarians, their orderly wedge thundering across the last yards to the Imperial forces.
“Hold the line! Hold the line!”
They held.
