## Description
Also known as an ''Icon of the Forge'', ''Icon of the Weaver'', or ''Icon of the Carpenter'', this ceremonial tool allows a priest to perform a [[Liao]] ceremony in the same manner as several other icons. These icons often bear iMages of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] such as [[Isenbrad]] who are closely associated with crafting, or characters such as [[Bolstering Bill]] or [[Inga Tarn]] whose legends are connected with special objects. An [[Icon of the Smith]] is sometimes designed to open so that an object can be placed inside it during the ceremony. Other common forms include a bowl or jug used with purified water or oils, or a hefty aspergil or thurible.
It can take months for a skilled artisan to create an Icon of the Smith. The [[Materials]] used often include small amounts of Magical materials, and it is very common for a crafter to use tools inlaid with dragonbone when working on an icon. More so than other icons, the Icon of the Smith tends to be intricately worked and some artisans who specialise in making religious accoutrements take great care and [[Pride]] in making an icon that allows a priest to lay Auras over the work of their peers. In [[Wintermark]] it is common to see one marked with [[Runes]], while in some parts of [[The Marches]] and [[Dawn]] these icons tend to be more practical in appearance - but still solidly made and decorated.
