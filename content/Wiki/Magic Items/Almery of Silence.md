## Description
An almery is a decorated box, generally used for holding either ceremonial tools or consumables such as oil or [[Liao]]. As with other [[Magic Items#Reliquaries|reliquaries]], while an [[Almery of Silence]] usually takes the form of a container, it might be infused into any object that has spiritual significance to the sect to which it belongs. Unlike many reliquaries, an [[Almery of Silence]] is rarely placed on public display. It is more likely to be concealed or kept in a secure location than it is to be placed on the altar of a [[Consecration|consecrated]] shrine.
While this reliquary is bonded to a sect, it conceals the auras of all members from the [[Insight]] ceremony. Even [[Liao#True Liao|true liao]] cannot garner any information about the aura of a person who is part of a sect with an [[Almery of Silence]]. Unlike more spiritually dangerous items such as a [[Shackle of the Unvirtuous]], or poisons like the [[Tisanes of the Labyrinth#Shadowcrow Infusion|Shadowcrow Infusion]] it does so without impeding the sect members' ability to perform liao ceremonies. They have been popular in the Empire among sects dedicated to [[Vigilance]] against the enemies of the Empire, and with sects that engage in missionary work to foreign nations where they might encounter someone capable of wielding the insight ceremony or something similar.
The Almery of Silence has never been a ''popular'' item. It is expensive compared to a [[Wayfarer's Pyx]] or [[Litany of the Labyrinth]] and the benefits it provides of questionable value to anyone other than a sect of [[Religious Crimes#Heresy|heretics]]. Yet there are always a few sects who value protection from the prying eyes of other priests.
The history of the Almery of Silence is a turbulent one. Several times during the history of the Empire it has been declared a [[List of Criminal Offences#Crimes of Property|criminal offence]] to create, own, or use this reliquary. Both [[Emperor Nicovar]] and [[Emperor Ahraz]] supported bans on the use of this item, albeit for different reasons. Surprisingly, however, the item began to see its first widespread use in the reign of [[Empress Teleri]], primarily in the hands of sects with an emphasis on missionary work among the [[Faraden]] and the [[Principalities of Jarm|Jarmish]] - something that is sometimes pointed out when the thorny discussion of its use comes up in the [[Imperial Synod]].
This item is certainly known among the priests of Faraden, and according to travelers and missionaries, an item with very similar effects is known in [[Axos]] - indeed there is some circumstantial evidence to suggest the item may have originated in that eastern nation. It is, perhaps unsurprisingly, completely illegal in the [[Sumaah Republic]].
## Rules
Reliquary
* Effect: The aura of every member of the [[Bands#Sects|sect]] is [[Insight#Concealment|concealed]] from the [[Insight]] ceremony. A character responding to a [[Insight#Performing a Quick Insight|quick insight]] ''must'' respond "''my aura is concealed''" and provide no other information. 
* Roleplaying Effect: You feel an urge to follow the teachings of your sect regardless of consequence. 
* Materials: Crafting an Almery of Silence requires five ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], seven ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], seven measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]], and eleven measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
