## Description
An almery is a decorated box, generally used for holding either ceremonial tools or consumables such as oil or [[Liao]]. As with other reliquaries, while an [[Almery of Silence]] usually takes the form of a container, it might be infused into any object that has spiritual significance to the [[Sect|sect]] to which it belongs. Unlike many reliquaries, an [[Almery of Silence]] is rarely placed on public display. It is more likely to be concealed or kept in a secure location than it is to be placed on the altar of a consecrated shrine.
While this reliquary is bonded to a sect, it conceals the auras of all members from the [[Insight]] ceremony. Even [[True liao|true liao]] cannot garner any information about the [[Aura|aura]] of a person who is part of a sect with an Almery of Silence. Unlike more spiritually dangerous items such as a [[Shackle of the Unvirtuous]], or poisons like the [[Shadowcrow Infusion]] it does so without impeding the sect members' ability to perform [[Liao|liao]] ceremonies. They have been popular in [[The Empire|the Empire]] among sects dedicated to [[Vigilance]] against the enemies of [[The Empire|the Empire]], and with sects that engage in [[Missionary work|missionary work]] to [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]] where they might encounter someone capable of wielding the [[Insight|insight]] ceremony or something similar.
The Almery of Silence has never been a ''popular'' item. It is expensive compared to a [[Wayfarer]]'s Pyx or [[Litany of the Labyrinth]] and the benefits it provides of questionable value to anyone other than a sect of heretics. Yet there are always a few sects who value protection from the prying eyes of other priests.
The [[History|history]] of the Almery of Silence is a turbulent one. Several times during the history of the Empire it has been declared a criminal offence to create, own, or use this reliquary. Both [[Emperor Nicovar]] and [[Emperor Ahraz]] supported bans on the use of this item, albeit for different reasons. Surprisingly, however, the item began to see its first widespread use in the reign of [[Empress Teleri]], primarily in the hands of sects with an emphasis on [[Missionary work|missionary work]] among the [[Faraden]] and the Jarmish - something that is sometimes pointed out when the thorny discussion of its use comes up in the [[Imperial Synod]].
This item is certainly known among the priests of [[Faraden]], and according to travelers and missionaries, an item with very similar effects is known in [[Axos]] - indeed there is some circumstantial evidence to suggest the item may have originated in that eastern nation. It is, perhaps unsurprisingly, completely illegal in the [[Sumaah Republic]].
## Rules

* [[Materials]]: Crafting an Almery of Silence requires five ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]], seven ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], seven measures of beggar's lye, and eleven measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
