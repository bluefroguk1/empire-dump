## Description
These weapons are often decorated with, or in some cases carved from, bone or horn. In parts of [[Wintermark]] they are made from the ivory of the great narwhal, while in other areas it is common to decorate them with the bones of dire beasts, especially great wolves. Hunters, bounty hunters and thief-takers find their properties especially useful - able to prevent prey from fleeing long enough for them to be apprehended or brought down.
## Rules
