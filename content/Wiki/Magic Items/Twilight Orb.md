## Description
This valuable item is usually crafted in the form of an orb of crystal, glass, metal inlaid with tempest jade. It is infused with potent enchantments and attuned to the realm of Night. A [[Groups#Covens|coven]] can use it to draw on the transformative power of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] and align it with their own magic, allowing them to reduce or in some cases replace the need for crystal mana when performing Night rituals.
In some cases, a [[Twilight Orb|twilight orb]] may be crafted as a dark mirror, a brazier or bowl, or a lantern. The item is often marked with [[Runes#Runes of Night|runes]]; or with images of transformation, such as butterflies. Regardless of the precise form it takes, a coven that uses it ensures that it takes pride of place in their ceremonies - in addition to its magical functions it is a potent reminder of their unity of purpose and their coven oath. In many cases the orb is kept perpetually in shadow or darkness, wrapped in cloth or concealed from casual viewers inside a decorated chest, and brought out only during the rituals where its power is evoked.
## Rules
Paraphernalia
* Effect: Members of the coven who are performing a Night ritual they have mastered may use [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] in place of crystal mana. Every two measures of Iridescent Gloaming spent count as 1 crystal mana.
* Materials: Crafting a [[Twilight Orb]] requires seven measures of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], four measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] and three measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
