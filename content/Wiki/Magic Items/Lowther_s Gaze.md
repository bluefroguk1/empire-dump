## Description
Lowther's Gaze is a talisman, similar to an [[Alder's Edge]], which allows the wearer to use a bow or crossbow with consummate skill. The item takes the form of a brooch or bracelet of smooth [[Dragonbone]], reinforced with green iron and polished with [[Ambergelt]]. The jewelled item should usually be marked with two eyes, most likely made from two faceted pieces of [[Tempest jade]]. 
The talisman will often bear the image of a keen-eyed hero, or a beast known for its excellent vision, especially a bird. The rune [[Feresh]] is often inscribed on the rear of the item, capturing both the perceptive abilities of the hawk and the concept of majestic prowess with arrows and bolts (both of which are of course feathered). 
The [[Magic items#Schema|schema]] for the talisman was developed by ''Gemma Brightsmith'', the [[Seer of the Spiral Sword]] using the [[Runeforge]] of the [[Seer of the Spiral Sword#The Spiral Sword|same name]] in [[Redoubt]]. It was shared with the [[Crafting skills#Artisans|artisans]] of the Empire following the Spring Equinox 384YE [[384YE Spring Equinox Senate sessions#Disseminate Lowther.27s Gage|by order]] of the Imperial Senate.
