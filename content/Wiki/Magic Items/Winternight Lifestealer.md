## Description
These vicious spears punch through leather and even [[Mithril|mithril]]-steel as if it were paper. They inflict catastrophic wounds, and a well-placed strike to a vital area can completely incapacitate a target in seconds. According to a pamphlet circulated in [[Temeschwar]] called ''The Case for banning the [[Winternight Lifestealer]]'' as recently as 369YE the weapons were first created by [[Winter]] eternals, and a portion of the soul of their victims is syphoned off to feed the relentless hunger of the Wasteland. The document was largely dismissed, but they are still widely considered to be weapons of ill-omen. 
A few Winterfolk settlements dominated by [[Kallavesi]] [[Will|will]] not allow a warrior who is revealed to bear one of these weapons to spend the [[Night|night]] in their hall. They say that the presence of these hateful weapons causes "bloody dreams" to disturb the minds of [[Children|children]] and those already susceptible to violent urges or traumatised by [[War|war]]. There may be some truth to these beliefs; the [[Suaq]] [[General|general]] Vilav Solving who led his countryfolk under the [[Banner|banner]] of [[Empress Varkula]] is said to have thrown himself to his death from the [[Skarsind]] peak that bears his name to this [[Day|day]], driven mad by terrible guilt caused by his artefact spear ''Heartpiercer'' which filled his sleep with dreams of everyone he had killed in the name of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
More pragmatic warriors are less concerned. These spears are especially popular with some Varushkan [[Schlacta|schlacta]], who combine the razor-sharp spear with a heavy shield and use them to dispatch wolves. They are also somewhat popular with Marcher beaters for use against [[Vermin|vermin]] whether it goes on two legs or four. They especially appreciate the spear's ability to pierce the defences of armoured bandits and those [[Feni]] and orcs whose piecemeal armour is supplemented by [[Mithril|mithril]] chain or stout hides. Some concern has been raised that over the years several of these weapons have fallen into the hands of the [[Feni]], who have been reported using them in several skirmishes - perhaps the same lost weapons, perhaps new ones constructed by those [[Feni]] artisans who have riddled out the secret of their construction.
## Rules
One-Handed Spears

* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Winternight Lifestealer]] requires thirteen ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], seven ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]], seven measures of beggar's lye and five ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
"Bringer of falcon-food, [[Bastion|bastion]] of slaughter-walls,
Sing I of Solving, of Vilav the brave.
Of wise Kallavasi, and [[Suaq]]-scout, [[Steinr]], 
[[War|war]]-host commanded, great victories won.
With death-branch tall standing, stern-faced for the foeman, 
Swimming in wound-rain, in battle-sweat bathed.
Heartpiercer, foe-death, his constant companion.
Driving through leather, or through [[Mithril|mithril]]-steel.
But whispering softly, its evil seed planting,
Heartpiercer, false-friend, brought him to his death.
No hearts-ease in mind's-[[Worth|worth]]. No sleep-safe soul-resting. 
Black dog walked with him, and darkened his heart.
He ran the white sky-road, and left us with heart's-rain,
Marsh-resting spear-man, in peace now at last."
