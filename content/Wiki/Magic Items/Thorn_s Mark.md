## Description
The [[Thorn]]'s Mark is potentially deadly in the hands of both [[Kallavesi]] and [[Steinr]] Warriors. The schema was purchased from the [[Eternal]] [[Estavus]] as part of her offer to the mediators of [[Wintermark]]. Originally known as the ''Eagles Talon'' the spear was renamed by the Steinr runesmith Derowen Voice of the Forge when she passed the schema to Sulkavaris to be added to Runesmith's Law.
