## Description
These staffs are usually made of stout hardwood, treated with [[Ambergelt]] and bound with dragonbone. Often they are decorated at either end, sometimes with grasping claws. They often have the rune [[Queros]] worked into them, and may be carved to look as if they are wound with chains. An [[Ethereal Manacle]] allows a magician to wield the power of the [[Entangle]] incantation to root their opponents in place.
Sometimes called a ''magician's retreat'', a little contemptuously, it cannot be denied that rooting an opponent to the spot can give the bearer a good head start. A skilled battle magician, however, is quite capable of rooting an opponent to the spot and then beating them down with the advantage of superior reach - even if The magician Starts the [[Fight]] outnumbered the additional power of this staff can quickly even the odds. Matially-minded Runesmiths and curmudgeonly Landskeepers are both known to [[Make good use]] of the short time their opponents cannot move to make them regret trying to gang-up on a magician.
## Rules
Staffs
* Effect: Three times per day you may cast the Entangle spell as if you knew it without spending any mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting an ethereal manacle requires eleven measures of ambergelt and four measures of dragonbone, and three measures of [[Iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
