## Description
These staffs are usually made of stout hardwood, treated with [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] and bound with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. Often they are decorated at either end, sometimes with grasping claws. They often have the [[Rune|rune]] [[Queros]] worked into them, and may be carved to look as if they are wound with chains. An [[Ethereal Manacle|ethereal manacle]] allows a [[Magician|magician]] to wield the power of the [[Entangle]] incantation to root their opponents in place.
Sometimes called a ''magician's retreat'', a little contemptuously, it cannot be denied that rooting an opponent to the spot can give the bearer a good head start. A skilled battle magician, however, is quite capable of rooting an opponent to the spot and then beating them down with the advantage of superior reach - even if the magician starts the [[Fight|fight]] outnumbered the additional power of this staff can quickly even the odds. Matially-minded runesmiths and curmudgeonly landskeepers are both known to [[Make good use|make good use]] of the short time their opponents cannot move to make them regret trying to gang-up on a magician.
## Rules
Staffs
* Effect: Three times per [[Day|day]] you may cast the [[Entangle]] spell as if you knew it without spending any mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting an [[Ethereal Manacle|ethereal manacle]] requires eleven measures of ambergelt and four measures of dragonbone, and three measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
