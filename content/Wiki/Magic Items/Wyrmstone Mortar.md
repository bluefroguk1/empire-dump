## Description
This [[Apothecary|apothecary]]'s bowl is traditionally made of stone, but wooden, ceramic and metal examples exist. Purified with beggar's lye, and often decorated with trace amounts of silver or [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]], the mortar is often carved with the symbol of a snake biting its own tail around the rim or spiralling around the inside of the bowl. While it is often created along with a pestle, the [[Magic|magic]] resides in the mortar alone and works whether the [[Herbs|herbs]] are being prepared using a mortar or a piece of heavy stone.
A [[Wyrmstone Mortar]] usually bears the [[Rune|rune]] [[Xun]], although older examples are often inscribed with [[Diras]], the Rune of Secrets. Traditionally in [[Wintermark]] the apothecary carves or paints the [[Runes|runes]] [[Rhyv]] (representing the [[Imperial Roseweald|Imperial roseweald]]) and [[Irremais]] (representing [[Bladeroot|bladeroot]]) onto the pestle they use with the mortar.
The [[Wyrmstone Mortar]] is particularly well-known in [[The Marches]], where its simple versatility is appreciated, and among the [[Navarr]]; both of these peoples sometimes name it an ''Alchemist's Friend''. The [[Navarr]] in particular, on their long [[Trods|trods]] far away from the storehouses of civilisation, sometimes find themselves with an excess of one [[Herb|herb]] and a deficiency of the other, and the power to turn [[Bladeroot|bladeroot]] into roseweald, with its purgative qualities, has also earned it the less-common name [[Vallorn]]-bane among the [[Navarr]].
In recent times, skilled [[Urizen]] alchemists have begun to take up the [[Wyrmstone Mortar]], giving it the name Empyrean Mortar for its use in preparing the costly Elixir of Empyrean Art.
