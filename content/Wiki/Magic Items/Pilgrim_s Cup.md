## Description
This ceremonial tool Generally takes the form of a drinking vessel - a cup, a goblet, a bowl, chalice, or even a drinking horn or tankard. It is used by priests of [[The Way]] to [[Empower]] the ceremony of [[Anointing]], allowing the creation of durable Auras, or the removal of the same. As part of the ceremony, it is common for a priest to mix a little [[Liao]] with pure water, alcohol, or fruit juice. The priest takes a sip of the contents and passes [[The Cup]] to the recipient who drinks deeply. A Freeborn priest might use a bowl of hot syrah, while a [[Navarr]] may add a little blood to the mix, possibly from a person who is already anointed with the [[Aura]] desired or who has demonstrated strong virtue.
In [[Highguard]] and [[Urizen]], the item is much more likely to take the form of a bowl or basin into which fresh water or oil is poured. Rather than sharing a drink together, the priest may physically wash or anoint the hands and forehead of the target with the liao mixture, or hold the basin for the recipient to do so themselves. This is especially true when the intention of the ceremony is to remove an unwanted aura - the symbolism of washing away a spiritual taint is particularly strong.
Like many such regalia, it is common for a Pilgrim's Cup to be Hallowed, especially with a [[Hallow]] that enCourages the priest to seek out people in need of spiritual council or support in time of need.
## Rules
Regalia
* Effect: When you perform or cooperate with the performance of the Anointing skill, you may spend up to three additional doses of Liao to increase the strength of the ceremony by the same amount.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Pilgrim's Cup requires six ingots of orichalcum, five measures of beggar's lye, and seven measures of dragonbone. It takes one month to make one of these items.
