## Description
This ceremonial tool generally takes the form of a drinking vessel - a cup, a goblet, a bowl, chalice, or even a drinking horn or tankard. It is used by priests of [[The Way]] to [[Empower|empower]] the ceremony of [[Anointing]], allowing the creation of durable auras, or the removal of the same. As part of the ceremony, it is common for a priest to mix a little [[Liao]] with pure water, alcohol, or fruit juice. The priest takes a sip of the contents and passes [[The Cup|the cup]] to the recipient who drinks deeply. A [[Freeborn]] priest might use a bowl of hot syrah, while a [[Navarr]] may add a little blood to the mix, possibly from a person who is already anointed with the [[Aura|aura]] desired or who has demonstrated strong virtue.
In [[Highguard]] and [[Urizen]], the item is much more likely to take the form of a bowl or basin into which fresh water or oil is poured. Rather than sharing a drink together, the priest may physically wash or anoint the hands and forehead of the target with the [[Liao|liao]] mixture, or hold the basin for the recipient to do so themselves. This is especially true when the intention of the ceremony is to remove an unwanted [[Aura|aura]] - the symbolism of washing away a spiritual taint is particularly strong.
Like many such regalia, it is common for a Pilgrim's Cup to be hallowed, especially with a [[Hallow|hallow]] that encourages the priest to seek out people in need of spiritual council or support in time of need.
## Rules
Regalia
* Effect: When you perform or cooperate with the performance of the [[Anointing]] skill, you may spend up to three additional doses of Liao to increase the strength of the ceremony by the same amount.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Pilgrim's Cup requires six ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]], five measures of beggar's lye, and seven measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
