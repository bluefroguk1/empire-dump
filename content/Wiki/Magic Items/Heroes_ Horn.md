## Description
A [[Heroes]]' Horn allows a priest to use a musical performance to draw on the power of the [[Consecration|consecration]] of [[Courage]] to inspire their audience. Listeners are filled with a profound sense of their ability to change the world if they only trust themselves and stick to what they know to be right. The power of the magical musical instrument itself is only part of the process that brings about this spiritual experience - the performance itself helps connect the spirit of the audience with the power of the potent consecrated [[Aura|aura]]. 
A common form for this musical instrument is a horn or trumpet, something that can be used to sound a rousing note before a battle. Some priests on the other hand, especially those of [[The Brass Coast]] and the [[Navarr]] like to use big, deep drums. During a ceremony, the drums are beaten with a slow rhythm that echoes a heartbeat, helping the celebrants to achieve the right mental state. In [[Wintermark]], [[Courage]] is represented by [[Jotra]], [[Rune]] of Battle, and many artificers choose to include this rune as part of the decoration of the instrument. In [[Dawn]] it is more likely to see these instruments decorated with the images of gryphons.
It is common for a priest using this musical instrument to intersperse inspiring poetry or readings from the lives of the [[Paragons and Exemplars]] of Courage between their [[Music|music]], or to perform as part of a group who combine their playing with inspiring songs.
As with many religious [[Magic Items]], it is common for an [[Heroes]]' Horn to be hallowed. A popular choice is the Hallowing of the Bard, perhaps unsurprisingly.
