## Description
The [[Choleric Staff]]  taps upon the power of the [[Realm|realm]] of [[Summer]] to maximise the potential of the bearer's [[Ritual|ritual]] power. These arcane implements are employed throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]] to fortify the abilities of Summer ritualists.
A [[Choleric Staff]] is often slightly shorter and heavier than other ritual staves. In [[The Marches]], a staff of this kind is often referred to as a ''Soldier's Shillelagh'' and wielded by magicians and covens that specialise in providing warlike enchantments. Such staves are carved from gnarled oak branches inlaid with [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] and [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] sigils and shod in alloys of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and iron. Marcher battle magicians or those with an Alder's Edge wield these staves to good effect on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] supporting their yeoman allies.
It is common to see such an implement engraved with the [[Runes|runes]] of Summer or with depictions of [[Constellations|constellations]] such as [[The Oak]], [[The Mountain]] or [[The Stallion]]. A ''Staff of Summer Stars'', as it is also known, is a favourite with [[Urizen]] and Dawnish ritual magicians who specialise in the higher magnitude [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Mantle of Lordly Might]] or [[Glory to the Sovereign]]. 
Making an artefact version of the [[Choleric Staff]] is a costly endeavour, but there are a handful of such items in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. They are usually passed down from [[Magician|magician]] to magician within a single [[Coven|coven]]. One of the best known is the ''Staff of the Noonday Sun'', crafted in 172YE by Karina Matrinova Vos, a Varushkan [[Volhov|volhov]] from [[Karov]] who used it to allow herself to perform [[Chasuble of Majesty]] by herself in the wilderness, as part of her self-appointed role as a defender and pilgrim of [[The Way]]. The staff has been passed from magician to magician ever since, usually within the [[Conclave order]] of the [[Sevenfold Path]], and is said to strongly influence its wielder toward hunting and destroying cults dedicated to heretical virtues.
### [[Archmage]] Staff
The staff of the [[Archmage of Summer]] is a version of the [[Choleric Staff]] crafted to a secret pattern, and grants twice as much power to the wielder. Unlike most such staves, the same physical staves are reforged each year; some of the staves are believed to have developed spontaneous auras as a consequence, and blamed for a certain “gung ho” attitude among the archmages of Summer.
