## Description
As with other icons, this ceremonial tool allows a priest to perform a [[Liao]] ceremony. Also known as an ''[[Icon of the Hearth]]'', these icons often bear images of [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] closely associated with the home, with defending places or with hospitality but in truth it is difficult to make definitive statements about their appearance beyond the fact that they tend to be significant religious items wielded during a ceremony.
It can take months for a skilled artisan to create an [[Icon of the Steward]]. The [[Materials|materials]] used often include small amounts of magical [[Materials|materials]], and it is very common for a crafter to use tools inlaid with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] when working on an icon. It is also quite common for an Icon of the [[Steward]] to be beautifully inlaid with precious metals and stones, and for it to be left in [[Pride|pride]]-of-place in a shrine when not in use. In many devout homes, an [[Icon of the Steward]] is the first ornament seen when one enters through the main door, even if the home itself is not consecrated to one of the virtues.
