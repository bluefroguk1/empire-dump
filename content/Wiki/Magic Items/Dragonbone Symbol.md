## Description
A symbol of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] is a common piece of jewellery worn by the devout. It is popular with adherents of [[The Way|the Way]] who are not themselves priests. While its power is limited, it provides spiritual strength in time of need. It is popular with devout warriors, and with those who face constant peril on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], as it helps them replenish their reserves of inner strength.
The most common form for one of these symbols to take is an amulet, medallion, pendant or badge marked with a symbol associated with one of the virtues, a [[Paragon|paragon]] or exemplar, or with [[The Way|the Way]] as a whole. The symbol is always crafted with tiny amounts of dragonbone, which help create a connection between the wearer and a consecrated [[Aura|aura]]. The amulet is commonly hallowed with an [[Aura|aura]] that complements the [[Dedication]] or [[Anointing]] of the wearer.
[[The Way]] tends does not encourage too much introspection. While it is possible to draw on the power of a [[Dragonbone Symbol|dragonbone symbol]] through quiet meditation, it is ''much'' more common to engage in spirited debate about the nature of the virtues, or to prevail on a suitable priest to deliver a sermon, offer spiritual advice, or lead a discussion about ways that the virtue can offer spiritual strength. Indeed, a priest with heroic reserves of their own might engage in a sermon or preaching to restore their ''own'' inner strength rather than that of their [[Congregation|congregation]].
## Rules
Jewellery
* Effect: Once per [[Day|day]], if you are Dedicated or Anointed, if you spend ten minutes of [[Appropriate roleplaying|appropriate roleplaying]] an area consecrated to the same virtue, you recover all your hero points. You cannot use this ability if you are on a battlefield or in a similar stressful environment. You cannot use this ability if you are under an effect that prevents recovery of hero points overnight (such as [[Dreamscape of the Endless Hunt]] and similar curses). 
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Dragonbone Symbol]] requires no special [[Materials|materials]]. It takes two months to make one of these items.
