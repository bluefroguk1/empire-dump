## Description
A re-purposed farming tool, the [[Reaving Mattock]] has a heavy steel head and a stout oak handle inlaid with [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]]. What a mundane mattock does to hard or frozen soil, the [[Reaving Mattock]] does to enemy soldiers, leaving them bleeding to death or crippled. They are unsurprisingly popular with the agriculturally-minded yeomen of [[The Marches|the Marches]] and with the Varushkans, and much less so with the citizens of [[The League|the League]], [[Dawn]] and [[Urizen]] due to their associations with farming.
These weapons were among the first weapons crafted by the Imperial Orc artisans after they joined [[The Empire|the Empire]], many of whom were familiar with similar tools from their time in the mines, or working the farms. They have remained a popular choice, especially with those Orcs who prefer to spend their time slaughtering their [[Barbarian|barbarian]] cousins rather than embracing the strict discipline of the [[Imperial armies]].
