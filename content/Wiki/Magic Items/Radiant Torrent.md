## Description
These solid rods are often polished to a mirror-smooth sheen. They allow a battlefield healer to restore health to their allies with a few powerful words. In the right circumstances are capable of preventing a bloody engagement turning into a rout.
## Rules

"Quite the eye-opener, Landskeeper."
"That it is, Grimnir, that it is." Jack Landskeeper grinned around the stem of his pipe, his gaze never wavering from the football pitch in front of them. "Look at 'em now, kickin' like bulls, runnin' like stags - any bugger says football's no preparation for war needs to come an' watch a few matches."
"And your role in this?" Maja asked, fixing him with her level, pale blue eyes.
"Keepin' 'em in line. Speakin' of which-" he suddenly raised his voice to a shout -"that was a foul, Ivy Applewood an' don't you think I didn't see it! Another one of those an' you're gettin' sent off! Bunch of hooligans, the lot of 'em," he added, with another grin. 
There was another sudden scuffle, as two players, a lanky yeoman from Greendale and the wiry Applewood girl both jumped to head the ball at the same time. There was a solid crunch as Ivy's elbow connected with her opponent's eye socket, and he went down hard on the ground. She turned to the Landskeeper, hands spread in supplication, already beginning her excuses, but he silenced her with one hard glare. "All right, Ivy, off."
"But Landskeeper-"
"Off." With a shake of his head, he drew a long dragonbone rod from his belt. "'Scuse me, Grimnir. Better see to Davey."
Maja watched from the touchline as the Landskeeper walked over to the fallen player, the rest of the team parting politely to let him through. He bent, muttering a few words too softly for her to hear, then tapped the rod lightly on the player's shoulder. There was a moment of silence, then the footballer got shakily to his feet, and the Landskeeper rejoined her, nodding with satisfaction as the game restarted.
"Very impressive. Tell me, though - is magic permitted as part of the game?"
Jack tapped out the dottle from his pipe, and started to repack it from his baccy pouch. "Nah. I just showed him the rod, an' told him I'd ram it so far up his arsehole it'd see daylight if he didn't stop carryin' on like that an' get up an' play like a Marcher.  Works like magic, don't it?"
