## Description
The ''[[Icon of the Driven]]'', also known as an ''Icon of the Ascendant'', allows a priest to perform ceremonies as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Ambition]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a [[Paragon|paragon]] or exemplar of [[Ambition]] such as [[Tian]] (often called an ''Icon of the Burnt''), [[Aldones di Sarvos]], or [[Adelmar the Lion]]. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of rooks, generally decorated with the [[Rune]] of Hunger, which is known as an ''Icon of the Rook'' or, more rarely, an ''Icon of the Hungry''. In [[Varushka]], the icon commonly takes the form of a statuette of a fox and is known as a ''Wily Fox''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - from the expertly illustrated scrolls recounting the great deeds of the [[Freeborn]], to the beautiful three-panel triptych favoured in [[The League]] (generally showing the humble origins, great struggle, and eventual success of the character depicted - with the final panel invariably suggesting that rather than resting on their laurels the ambitious person [[Will|will]] not work towards a new goal).  
Icons of the Driven are significantly less popular than other, similar icons. Priests who rely on them sometimes encounter an unspoken, perhaps even unconscious, prejudice from dedicated priests and lay followers of [[Ambition]]. Splitting one's focus - using a [[Magical Item|magical item]] to allow one to wield the [[Auras of Ambition|auras of Ambition]] is sometimes seen as reflecting a lack of character, drive, or commitment. To many ambitious people, it simply makes no sense to be dedicated to another virtue and use an [[Icon of the Driven]] - it is much more appropriate to be dedicated to [[Ambition]] and use the tools provided to employ the auras provided by lesser virtues. It is rarely acceptable to put such sentiments into words, of course.
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Ambition|auras of Ambition]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to [[Ambition]] who are not part of their [[Sect|sect]].
