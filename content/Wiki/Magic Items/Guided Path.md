## Description
There is a strongly-held belief in some sects that certain [[Religious skills|ceremonies]] have effects that will follow a dying person into the Labyrinth. They believe that an [[Anointing]] can help the passage of a soul, or a powerful [[Testimony]] follow someone into the next life in some fashion. Less merciful sects believe that if a person dies while [[Excommunication|excommunicate]] it will impede their passage to reincarnation, or even cause the soul of a criminal marked in this fashion to be destroyed. Even sects that do not adhere to such beliefs see the value of performing ceremonies to offer comfort to the dying. These sects are the ones likely to make use of a [[Guided Path]].
Normally taking the form of an amulet or talisman of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] usually marked with a Labyrinth, a [[Guided Path]] takes its popular name from the [[Navarr]]. Some [[Navarr religious beliefs|guides]] have made use of the item since long before the founding of the Empire in a quest to help the dying to find their way back to a partner in the [[Navarr culture and customs#The Great Dance|Great Dance]]. A similar item known as an ''Amulet of the Threshold'' was used by [[Highguard|Highborn]] sects who offered comfort to the dying. Both items predate the use of [[Liao]], and some theological historians suggest that the use of items such as the [[Guided Path]] may provide some evidence that the very first uses of ceremonial skills were to prepare the dying for their next lives.
