## Description
A Stalwart's Sword is a powerful weapon for any [[Wintermark]] [[Heroism|hero]] to wield. The ancient creed of the Wintermark people is "The storm can never break us" - the Sword helps an aspiring warrior live up to that heroic ideal, granting them [[Courage]] to stand firm in the face of fear as well as the inner strength needed to face down the most powerful enemies.
The artisan who crafts the Sword should take care when binding it to the warrior who will wield it. The choice to take up the Stalwart's Sword can be a key moment in a person's skein, representing a moment when they commit themselves to the path of the hero. Not every warrior is ready to make this choice, not every warrior is ready to carry a Stalwart's Sword. The sword gives the wielder the ability to resist fear, but it can't make a bannerbearer out of a maggot, no matter what magic you grant them. Those who fall short of their Sword's challenge will find their skein is [[Wintermark religious beliefs#The Frayed|frayed]].
The smiths at [[Hahnmark#Runegrott|Runegrott]] teach smiths to inscribe the Wintermark rune [[Sular]] onto the flat of the blade, three fingers width from the pommel. If that cannot be done then it can be added to the scabbard that holds the weapon. They claim that the Stalwart's Sword can help the bearer discover the best choices to make as their pursue their skein in the face of danger.

Runesmith's Law
"Sular?" queried the young girl. That seems wrong - "Surely Jotra would be a better choice?"
"Hah!" laughed Hufi Thriceforgeed. "This is no Apprentice's Blade, Sanna!" He was laughing but she could see from his smile that this was the question he had hoped she would ask.
"Jotra, the rune of battle! The Crimson Rune! The Thunderhead! Crossed swords, blood spilled, lives ended. Why not indeed? Why don't we put Jotra on every weapon we make?"
Sanna shrugged. It seemed like a fair question - she knew a lot of smiths who did put Jotra on every weapon. It was the obvious choice.
"The art of the runesmith is not the drawing of runes Sanna, it's the ''choosing'' of them. This is how we guide the skein of those we arm for battle. If you want the warrior who bears your Sword to go charging into every battle they find, then put Jotra on the blade." He paused for a long moment, list in some quiet contemplation. Sanna longed to ask another question but she'd had enough cuffs round the back of the head to learn when to wait.
"This Stalwart's Sword will fill the warrior you bind it to with [[Courage]]. She won't shy away from a fight no matter the odds. So by all means use Jotra if you want them to wind up dead quicker than a bird takes flight. If, however you want her to discover that heroism takes many forms, that there are other ways to fork their skein.. then I recommend Sular."
