## Description
This [[Apothecary|apothecary]]'s bowl is traditionally made of iron, and used to boil [[Herbs|herbs]] and other components when brewing a [[Potion|potion]]. Some ceramic, bone or wooden examples exist, used to steep herbs in boiling water rather than held directly over a fire. An [[Escharotic Cauldron]] is often decorated with [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], and inlaid with pieces of ivory. Regardless, it is usually of sturdy construction and insulated against the hot liquids it is generally employed to enchant.
An [[Escharotic Cauldron]] often bears the [[Rune|rune]] [[Xun]], although older examples are often inscribed with [[Diras]], the Rune of Secrets. Traditionally in [[Wintermark]] the apothecary carves or paints the [[Runes|runes]] [[Bravash]] (representing the [[Marrowort|marrowort]]) and [[Verys]] (representing [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]]) onto the inside of the cauldron before they use it.
## Rules
Tool
* Requirement: You must have the Apothecary skill to bond to this item.
* Effect: When you use the apothecary skill to create a [[Potion|potion]] you may substitute two drams of [[Marrowort]] for one dram of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]], or two drams of [[Cerulean Mazzarine]] for one dram of [[Marrowort]]. You can only make this substitution once per preparation.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting an [[Escharotic Cauldron]] requires seven measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
