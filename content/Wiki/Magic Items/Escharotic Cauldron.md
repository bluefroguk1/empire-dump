## Description
This apothecary's bowl is traditionally made of iron, and used to boil herbs and other components when brewing a [[Potion]]. Some ceramic, bone or wooden examples exist, used to steep herbs in boiling water rather than held directly over a fire. An [[Escharotic Cauldron]] is often decorated with [[Ambergelt]], and inlaid with pieces of ivory. Regardless, it is usually of sturdy construction and insulated against the hot liquids it is Generally employed to enchant.
An Escharotic Cauldron often bears the rune [[Xun]], although older examples are often inscribed with [[Diras]], the Rune of Secrets. Traditionally in [[Wintermark]] the apothecary carves or paints the [[Runes]] [[Bravash]] (representing the [[Marrowort]]) and [[Verys]] (representing [[Cerulean Mazzarine]]) onto the inside of the cauldron before they use it.
