## Description
This apothecary's bowl is traditionally made of iron, and used to boil herbs and other components when brewing a potion. Some ceramic, bone or wooden examples exist, used to steep herbs in boiling water rather than held directly over a fire. An [[Escharotic Cauldron]] is often decorated with ambergelt, and inlaid with pieces of ivory. Regardless, it is usually of sturdy construction and insulated against the hot liquids it is generally employed to enchant.
An [[Escharotic Cauldron]] often bears the rune [[Xun]], although older examples are often inscribed with [[Diras]], the Rune of Secrets. Traditionally in [[Wintermark]] the apothecary carves or paints the runes [[Bravash]] (representing the marrowort) and [[Verys]] (representing cerulean mazzarine) onto the inside of the cauldron before they use it.
