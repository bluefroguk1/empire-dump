## Description
A [[Burnished Rampart]], sometimes called an ''Undying Shield'', a ''Brazen Shield'' or occasionally even an ''[[Orichalcum]] Shield'' is most often made of metal, with an [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]] finish. The shield itself is difficult to destroy without the use of [[Magic|magic]].  
It was first devised by the runesmiths of the [[Steinr]] to test the resolve of young warriors. Many cocky youngsters would claim that if only their shields had not been shattered by the hammers of the trolls, they would have held the line until their deaths. Tired of such boasting, a [[Runesmith]] named Thyra created the first Undying Shields and offered them such warriors, telling him that if true [[Heroism|heroism]] burned in their souls, then such a shield would never fail them. Some were worthy of the shields' [[Magic|magic]] while some fled with little but splinters.
A [[Burnished Rampart]] may be engraved with the [[Rune|rune]] [[Pallas]], often inlaid in gold or a gold-orichalcum alloy. Some bearers [[Will|will]] mark their shields with paint to show how often it had been broken and repaired, as a display of their determination and [[Dedication|dedication]] to the Virtue of [[Pride]].
## Rules

If you are attacked or make an attack while using this ability the attempt fails and you must begin the roleplaying again.
