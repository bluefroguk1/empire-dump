## Description
The [[Strigine Mask]] empowers a ritualist with the ability to discover information about distant places. The [[Eyes of the Sun and Moon]] and [[Eye of the High Places]] are rituals often employed in the service of the Empire to help plan military strategy or uncover the details of imminent threats to its citizens. Combined with other potent [[Magic Items|magic items]] such as a [[Luminous Staff]], and in conjunction with the [[Regio#The Imperial Regio|Imperial Regio]], a master of [[Day magic]] may be able to perform these valuable rituals without the need for a full [[Coven]].
More commonly, the masks are employed by a coven to grant additional power when dealing with a magical [[Wiki Updates#Shrouds|shroud]] that attempts to stymie or mislead magical scrying. When worn by someone who has mastered the ritual, the mask can add significant strength to attempts to pierce such shrouds and determine the truth of what lies within them.
Some magicians who use these masks talk of dreaming of soaring high above the ground when they next sleep, speeding over familiar or unfamiliar terrain, and of feeling a great and comforting of detachment - as if they are above the transitory concerns of the land below them. Some [[Mystic|mystics]] in particular are fascinated by these dreams, especially in circumstances where the mask wearer describes sensations of being transformed into an eagle, hawk, owl, or albatross.
These talismans are often crafted as an owl mask or piece of jewellery depicting a bird of prey with bright penetrating eyes made of polished gemstone. Many such items incorporate [[Ophis]], the Rune of Revelation.
