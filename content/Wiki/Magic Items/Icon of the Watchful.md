## Description
An [[Icon of the Watchful]] allows a priest to perform ceremonies as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Vigilance]]. It Generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a paragon or exemplar of [[Wisdom]] such as [[Vardas]] or [[Berechiah]]. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Varushka]] it often takes the form of a statuette of a goose, and is known as a ''Vigilant Goose'' - or occasionally a [[Vigilant Swan]]; when a Visitor queries the name, pointing out the statue is obviously a goose, they are congratulated on their keen perception. In [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of the same bird, generally decorated with the Rune of Revelation, which is known as an ''Icon of the Goose'' or a ''Bright Icon''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - from the colourful Illuminated scrolls recounting the lives of the exemplars popular in [[The Brass Coast]] to the delicate green crystal spindles wrapped in weltsilver the [[Urizen]] call an ''Emerald Beacon''. 
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Vigilance]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to Vigilance who are not part of their sect.
