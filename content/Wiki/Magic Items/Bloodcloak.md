Title: Bloodcloak
---
## Description
The most common appearance of a [[Bloodcloak]] is a dark red mantle or hooded cloak, usually embroidered with the [[Rhyv|rune of blood]]. They are rarely heavily decorated, and tend to have a practical aesthetic.
The first Bloodcloaks were made centuries ago to be worn by [[Wintermark military concerns#Grimnir|grimnir]] marching alongside the original [[Wintermark military concerns#The Bloodcloaks|Bloodcloaks]] army. Indeed, the [[General]] of the Bloodcloaks was the custodian of the "original" [[Bloodcloak]] - an artifact version of the more common cloak. When the army fell to the [[Thule]] during the name of [[Empress Brannan]], the [[Bloodcloak]] was lost - and with it the knowledge of how to make this useful [[Crafting skills#Physick|physicks']] tool. 
During the last months of 380 YE, however, an escaped slave from the now [[Thule]] controlled [[Sermersuaq#Silver Peaks|Silver Peaks]] made it to Anvil and was granted hospitality at the [[Wintermark groups#Stormspire|Stormspire]] over the winter. During his stay information was given that the original Bloodcloak was now in possession of a warlock known as Skogr the Red. In Spring 381YE a [[Sentinel Gate#Conjunctions|conjunction]] was identified through the [[Sentinel Gate]] allowing negotiations between the Winterfolk and the warlock. With the aid of Juha the Cave Spider - the newly recognised [[Ambassador to Otkodov]] - Raknar Ravenstorm was able to secure not only the return of the cloak itself, but also the release of fifty Wintermark slaves incarcerated in the mines of Skogr the Red. The Bloodcloak itself was awarded to Lofyn Bloodcloak who now resides as the general of the newly formed Bloodcloak army of Wintermark.
During examination, it was discovered that concealed within the lining of the cloak - unbeknownst to the Thule - was the original [[Magic items#Schema|schema]]! In Autumn 381YE, the Senate agreed to [[Add Bloodcloak schema to Imperial Lore|add the schema to Imperial Lore]], allowing any Imperial [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] to weave and enchant it.
