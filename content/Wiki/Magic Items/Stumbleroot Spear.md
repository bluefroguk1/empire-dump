## Description
The dark wood haft of this spear must be supple and flexible, while maintaining its strength. An artisan carefully chooses the wood and treats it throughout the crafting process with [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] dissolved in pure alcohol, reinforcing the whole with [[Green iron|green iron]] to maintain its responsiveness in the hands of a skilled warrior. In [[Combat|combat]], the spear twists and turns, seemingly under its own power, and when properly guided [[Will|will]] trip or unbalance an enemy, sending them sprawling. 
Some stories claim that the more blood the [[Stumbleroot Spear]] spills, the more malicious it becomes. They suggest that the spear begins to take on a mind of its own, seeking to trip or injure opponents without the intent of the wielder. They rarely speak of these worries unless deep in their cups. There is a tradition among some thorns of [[Burning|burning]] the spear after a year to ensure it does not turn on its wielder. Some [[Imperial Orcs]] have adopted the same tradition, which meshes with their own beliefs about [[Worth]] and the ways objects may be influenced by the uses they are put to.
