## Description
The [[Luminous Staff]] taps upon the power of the  [[Realm]] of Day to bring clarity of sight and thought to the bearer, increasing their ritual aptitude. These arcane implements are employed throughout [[The Empire]] to fortify the abilities of Day ritualists.
These often pure-white gleaming implements are usually engraved with [[Cavul]], the Rune of Purity and [[Aesh]], the Rune of Thought.
The staff of the [[Archmage of Day]] is a version of the luminous staff crafted to a secret pattern, and grants twice as much power to the wielder.
