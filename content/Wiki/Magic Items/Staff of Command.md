## Description
A [[Staff of Command]] is often made of metal, or at least shod and inset with pieces of metal and gemstones.

Several prominent wielders of staffs such as these have allegedly fallen into dictatorial or even tyrannical ways - according to common folk tales these staves whisper into the ears of their owners of the joys of control and command, domination and subversion. A [[Magician|magician]] who relies on a [[Staff of Command]] can often receive a cold welcome among the [[Freeborn]].
It is common to see a Staff of Command engraved with the incantations used to cast the spells it provides. It is also common to see a Staff of Command marked with [[Runes|runes]] of [[Autumn]], most commonly [[Hirmok]] although [[Feresh]] is also common.
