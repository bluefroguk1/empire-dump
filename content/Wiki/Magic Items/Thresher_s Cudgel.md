## Description
A [[Thresher]]'s Cudgel is most commonly a stout knobkerry or shillelagh bound with iron and inlaid with [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]]. These weapons are often carried by threshers in [[The Marches|the Marches]], but they are known throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Some [[Unconquered|unconquered]] warriors among the [[Highguard]] call them ''Shamansbane'' weapons, and the nickname is often used by any skirmisher or scout who regularly finds themselves fighting an enemy [[Magician|magician]].
Battlefield opportunists find them particularly useful against enemy magicians who use the rely on staffs, finding them much easier to hit during an engagement - and because such implements are generally only carried by competent [[War|war]] casters. The most successful Orcish thief-takers acquire these weapons as a tool against well-equipped thieves who employ magical implements such as Yeoman's Bounty to help them evade pursuit. Some call it ''[[Mountebank]]’s Goodbye'' after numerous run-ins between thief-takers and [[The League|the League]]’s most dastardly criminal magicians.
Orc-made versions tend to use [[Jotra]], the [[Rune]] of Battle, to [[Fight|fight]] the opponent’s [[Magic|magic]], while Highborn artisans, favouring the power of the [[Winter]] [[Realm|realm]] prefer to use the [[Yoorn]], the Rune of Severance, to cut away the enemy’s power. While perfectly capable of wielding them, some magicians are reluctant to bond to a [[Thresher]]’s Cudgel, claiming a sense of resentment radiating from the weapon. Some oathwrights explain that as it is the weapon’s nature to destroy [[Mage|mage]] implements, most examples have an intrinsic dislike of magicians. Most other commentators believe such magicians are simply imagining the effect.
## Rules
One-Handed Weapons
* Effect: You may spend a hero point to call [[Shatter|SHATTER]] with this one-handed weapon when you strike a [[Mage|mage]] implement.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Thresher]]'s Cudgel requires nine ingots of tempest jade. five ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]], three measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], and three measures of beggar's lye. It takes one month to make one of these items.
The [[Volodny|volodny]] thrust with his staff towards [[The Three Sisters|the three sisters]], keeping them at bay as around them the tormented spirits of the damned villagers shrieked and wailed.
"I [[Will|will]] freeze your blood!" cried the [[Volodny|volodny]], his eyes flashing with silver. He thrust towards the youngest sister, Zelda Ignazy, but she swung her axe with all her might and struck the staff in the middle, shattering it to splinters. As the [[Volodny|volodny]] reeled back, the spirits of the damned villagers swarmed upon Zelda and whispered to her of her lost love, buried these long six months beneath the frozen earth, and she wept and fell to her knees.
"I [[Will|will]] drive you from my presence!" cried the [[Volodny|volodny]], drawing a rod of twisted pine marked with [[Runes|runes]] of despair and fear. He swung towards the middle sister, Magda Ignazy, but she swayed aside as a tree sways in a storm, and struck the rod with her sword, shattering it to splinters, As the [[Volodny|volodny]] staggered away, the spirits of the damned villagers surged forward again, and whispered to Magda of her dead daughter, buried these long six years beneath the frozen earth, and she wept and fell to her knees.
"I [[Will|will]] bring the shadow of death onto you all!" cried the volodny, and drew from the hidden place beneath his crimson robe a wand carved from the bone of a child and inlaid with the black stone that was his heart, the wand that looked like a wizened finger wearing an iron ring, as heavy as the full moon. 
This was what the eldest sister, Rhina Ignazy, had been waiting for. She had held back while her sisters fought, remembering what the goose had told her and her sisters, remembering the advice their grandfather had given them before they set out.
As the volodny darted forward, his sleeves flapping like the wings of a great bloody bat, she struck with her wooden club, and broke the wand into flinders of bone and shattered crystal. 
The volodny gave a single terrible cry, and then cracks ran across his skin, as he broke apart like an old clay bowl struck with a hammer, leaving nothing but dust and tattered robes.
