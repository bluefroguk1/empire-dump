## Description
The Runesmith's Glare takes its name from the device that is normally [[Painted]] on the shield, usually a raptor, often an owl, but sometimes an osprey, a hawk or a falcon. Occasionally the artisan will use a raven or another corvidae or sometimes just a pair of eyes. The tradition dates back to the very first Runesmith's Glare which was said to have been brought to [[Isenbrad]] by a bird sent by an ice giant. Isenbrad was so transfixed by the bird's glare that he painted the iMage of it (or the eyes in some version of the tale) on the shield as a token of his respect. Despite the obviously apocryphal nature of the tale (there are no such things as ice giants and there are no [[Birds]] large enough to carry a shield in [[Wintermark]]), the legend persists and most artisans who teach a student how to make the Glare pass on the story.
In addition, or sometimes instead, the artisan will often paint or emblazon [[Runes]] on the edge of the shield. Runes such as [[Tykonus]] and [[Zorech]] are both favoured - and often used together. The first invokes the power of the Summer [[Realm]], helping to bring strength and prowess in battle. The latter is more commonly associated with the Night Night realm. It is used here to invigorate the wielder's passions and strengthen their will.

Runesmith's Law
The schlacta hefted the great shield, feeling the weight of it strapped to his arm. He moved it back and forth, trying to judge how easily he might move with it in battle. "It's a good shield", he said, "How much does it [[Cost]]?"
Hufi looked at the Varushkan and suppressed a sigh. It wasn't that he didn't like Varushkans, although that was true. And it wasn't that he didn't like selling the pieces he made, although that was also true. He just resented the fact that this Warrior was picking up a [[Heroes]] shield and all he could think of to ask was "How much does it cost?"
"The Glare strengthens the body and the spirit in equal measure. The Osprey, one of the great birds of the north, is a sign of a warrior, a hunter and a hero. Those who bear an Osprey on their arm need fear no evil. Theirs is a hero's path."
"Right. Right. So how much is it?"
Hufi ground his teeth together in frustration. "For you. 4 thrones". It was a Thane's ransom, and an obvious insult, but Varushkans were rich as maggots, everyone knew that. And it was not like he didn't need the money...
