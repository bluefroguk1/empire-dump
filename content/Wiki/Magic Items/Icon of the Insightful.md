## Description
An [[Icon of the Insightful]] is also known as an ''Icon of the Measured'', ''Icon of the Shrewd'', ''Icon of the Astute'', and of course an ''Icon of the Wise''. It allows a priest to perform ceremonies as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Wisdom]]. It Generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a paragon or exemplar of Wisdom such as [[Zoria]] or Avigliana. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Varushka]] it often takes the form of a statuette of a squirrel, and is known as a ''Wise Gatherer''. In [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of ravens, generally decorated with the Rune of Wisdom (or the Rune of Thought), which is known as an ''Icon of the Raven'' or an ''Icon of [[The Blade]] (Staff)''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - from the finely written scrolls of [[The Brass Coast]] to the clear crystal trapezohedron the [[Urizen]] call a ''White Star''. 
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Wisdom]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to Wisdom who are not part of their sect.
