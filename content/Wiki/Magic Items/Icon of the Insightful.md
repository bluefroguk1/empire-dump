## Description
An [[Icon of the Insightful]] is also known as an ''Icon of the Measured'', ''Icon of the Shrewd'', ''Icon of the Astute'', and of course an ''Icon of the Wise''. It allows a priest to perform ceremonies as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Wisdom]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a [[Paragon|paragon]] or exemplar of [[Wisdom]] such as [[Zoria]] or Avigliana. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Varushka]] it often takes the form of a statuette of a squirrel, and is known as a ''Wise Gatherer''. In [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of ravens, generally decorated with the [[Rune]] of [[Wisdom]] (or the Rune of Thought), which is known as an ''Icon of the Raven'' or an ''Icon of [[The Blade|the Blade]] (Staff)''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - from the finely written scrolls of [[The Brass Coast]] to the clear crystal trapezohedron the [[Urizen]] call a ''White Star''. 
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Wisdom|auras of Wisdom]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to [[Wisdom]] who are not part of their [[Sect|sect]].
