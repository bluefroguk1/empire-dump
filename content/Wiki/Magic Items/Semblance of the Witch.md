## Description
The [[Semblance of the Witch]] is a suit of magical clothing infused with a little of the power of the dramaturgical persona of [[The Witch]]. A [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magician|magician]] who wears this clothing can draw on the power it contains to [[Empower|empower]] their ability to perform [[Night magic]]. In addition to providing additional magical power, the robes also infuse the wearer with some of the personality of [[The Witch|the Witch]].
The robe contains the essence of the [[Witch]], allowing the wearer to embrace that role in their [[Magic|magic]] and in their [[Day|day]]-to-day dealings with others. It enhances the subtlety and confidence of the wearer, potentially giving them an advantage in social and political situations.
The raiment itself is cut from expensive, luxurious fabric - silks and satins are most common. Extra effort is made to ensure the robe is comfortable to wear - [[Naga]] in particular [[Will|will]] find the touch of the material on their skin to be particularly pleasurable. It is dyed deep, powerful colours and extensively embellished with moonsilver, seed pearls, and pieces of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and dark [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]]. The cut is reminiscent of the robes favoured by some Dawnish weavers and enchanters as well as by some Highborn [[Magisters|magisters]] - a full sleeved robe with a voluminous hood. Several designs include soft fur lining and lavish edging.
Other popular designs include ''Fortune's Attire'', which is patterned after [[Freeborn]] designs combining rainbow silks worn in layers of draped material, and the delicate ''Nightwarden's Shadow'' a layered garment in striking yet subtle shades of blue patterned after traditional [[Urizen]] dress and perfect for those who wish to use their [[Magic|magic]] to aid others without drawing attention to themselves.
