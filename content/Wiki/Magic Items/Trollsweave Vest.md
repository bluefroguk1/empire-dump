## Description
The cloth used to make these sturdy pieces of clothing is woven with weltsilver threads and stiffened with ambergelt resin - a type of cloth called trollsweave by the [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]]. The hems are often intricately decorated with the rune [[Rhyv]], in the [[Varushka|Varushkan]] style, symbolising both healing and the wearer’s sacrifice of more protective garb in favour of these robes. While other magical robes are often long and dramatic, these vests tend to be shorter to prevent them hindering the wearer on the battlefield when seconds can make all the difference in saving a life. 
These valuable tunics are favoured by heroic magician-healers who move quickly through the heart of the battle in search of those hovering on the brink of death who cannot wait for the attentions of a [[Surgical skills#Chirurgeon|chirurgeon]]. This ability, to pull a patient back from the very edge of life, has led to the vest being called a “''Gravesnatcher’s Shroud''” in the [[The League|League]], and to skilled battlefield healers sometimes being called gravesnatchers. 
Some scholars claim that the intense burst of Spring magic delivered through the use of these robes has a greater chance of causing the latent [[Briar]] lineage to manifest in a patient. Several notable [[Urizen magical traditions#Stargazers|stargazers]] have publicly dismissed this theory, but those with strong prejudices against briars are leery about the use of this garment. 
When combined with a [[Woundbinder]] wand, the two items together are sometimes called the ''Warhealer's Regalia'' or occasionally the ''Chirurgeon's Tools''.
