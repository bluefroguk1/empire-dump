## Description
This rod takes its name from its most common appearance; a stout rod bearing the head of a lion and a dragon at one end and with the base carved to resemble the head of a serpent. The chimera is a legendary symbol of a ferocious, dangerous opponent that is supremely adaptable to battle, whether tearing into an opponent with its talons, poisoning them with its serpentine tail, terrorizing them with its roar or knocking them prone with an overwhelming charge. In some legends the chimera can even breathe fire or spit poison, adding a ranged component to its deadly arsenal.
In [[Highguard]] and parts of [[The League]] they call this rod a ''hidden arsenal'', and the magisters who bear them prefer to have them constructed of dark matte steel. The [[Imperial Orcs]] often carve these rods of bone (sometimes the shin-bone of a particularly Warlike shaman or a ritualist versed in the lore of Summer), tipped with [[The Claw]] of some powerful beast, and call one a ''talon of victory''.
