## Description
A [[Runemark Shirt]] is a light hauberk or harness of padded cloth or thin leather.  However, its true power lies in its ability to inspire the wearer. The appearance of these shirts varies greatly across the Empire but most bear symbols important to the wearer, emblems of organisations or ideas they believe in and can drive them to greatness. Bonding to these shirts can lead to an even greater devotion to the cause depicted, as they fill the wearer with [[Pride]] and [[Courage]]. 
Those made in [[Wintermark]] most closely live up to the name ''[[Runemark Shirt]]'', bearing [[Verys]], the Rune of Might, and other [[Runes]] important to the wearer, such as runes associated with their lineage or favoured Virtue. The presence of the runes in general remind the Winterfolk of their rich mystical heritage.
In [[Varushka]] the ''[[Runemark Shirt]]'' is more likely to depict [[Varushka Religious Beliefs#The Virtuous Animals|animals]], particularly bears, boars and hounds.
While the [[Imperial Orcs]] will obviously work their personal [[Imperial Orcs|legion]] [[Imperial Orcs hearth magic#Symbols|symbol]] into the crafting of the armour. Some take particular pride in wearing Runemark Shirts bearing the image of the Imperial [[Horse]], proclaiming that their greatest inspiration is the Empire as a whole, rather than any small part of it.
Other nations decorate them with their own favoured symbols such as  [[Dawn Culture and Customs#Heraldry|Dawnish heraldry]], the symbols of their [[Chapter]], or whatever it takes to inspire the wearer to push themselves to greater deeds.

"Forgive me, ancestors, but you are wrong.  I shall prove our worth to my brothers and sisters in the Legion.  I shall prove our worth to the humans that look on us with fear and mistrust.  And I shall prove our worth to you as well, even if I have to cross the Abyss to do it."
