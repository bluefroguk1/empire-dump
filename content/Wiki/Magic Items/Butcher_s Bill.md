## Description
These polearms are comparatively cheap to craft, and this helps to make them popular among both Marcher Households and League free companies. They can be bought in moderate numbers, and used to add additional strength to a unit of skilled soldiers, or allow a recruit to [[Fight]] nEarly as well as their more experienced colleagues. 
Their extensive use on [[The Battlefield]] as part of tight formations has given them a brutal reputation that is not entirely deserved. They take their name from the "butcher's bill", the list of casualties after a battle. Several Generals have referred to the use of these weapons as "''balancing the butcher's bill''" by ensuring there are more casualties on the enemy side than on the Imperial side.
## Rules
