## Description
These polearms are comparatively cheap to craft, and this helps to make them popular among both Marcher households and [[League]] [[Free Companies|free companies]]. They can be bought in moderate numbers, and used to add additional strength to a unit of skilled soldiers, or allow a recruit to [[Fight|fight]] nearly as well as their more experienced colleagues. 
Their extensive use on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]] as part of tight formations has given them a brutal reputation that is not entirely deserved. They take their name from the "butcher's bill", the list of [[Casualties|casualties]] after a battle. Several generals have referred to the use of these weapons as "''balancing the butcher's bill''" by ensuring there are more [[Casualties|casualties]] on the enemy side than on the Imperial side.
## Rules

The sutler looked up from her ledger at the servant in front of her, and replied: "Do me the honour of informing the [[Merchant Prince]] that his [[Business|business]] may provide him with a solid income, but he [[Will|will]] need to extend his reach if he wishes to arm one in five of his company's recruits with even the cheapest of artisan-crafted weapons." 
"But the reputation of the soldiery of [[Tassato]]!" 
"...[[Will|will]] survive this minor setback. Train them harder, and longer. I can profit better in Overton, and my concern is the [[Prosperity]] of my [[Guild]]."
