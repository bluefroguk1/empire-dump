## Description
A pectoral comes in a variety of forms, but the most common are a jewelled necklace that is suspended from the neck. They often have a large medallion, usually marked with [[Runes|runes]]. Regardless of their shape, a [[Sunfire Pectoral]] is formed of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] alloyed with gold or occasionally copper, coloured and polished with [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]], and usually with [[Green iron|green iron]] alloy chains or buckles holding it in place. They are often inlaid with decorative gemstones. It is common to see a [[Sunfire Pectoral]] marked with a heraldic device in [[Dawn]], [[The League|the League]], [[Highguard]] and [[The Marches|the Marches]], but even in nations where heraldry is not common they tend to bear a symbol of either a leaping flame (especially in [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]], where a particularly garishly decorated pectoral is sometimes called a ''Flav's flame'' after a notorious [[Corsair]] battle-[[Magician|magician]]) or the sun - a common symbol of the Virtue of [[Pride]].
Wearers often seem to be energetic and passionate, and are especially vocal about strongly held beliefs or philosophies. It is common for the pectoral to bear the [[Rune|rune]] [[Zorech]], which accentuates these traits.
