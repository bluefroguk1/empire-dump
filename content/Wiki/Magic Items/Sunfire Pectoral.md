## Description
A pectoral comes in a variety of forms, but the most common are a jewelled necklace that is suspended from the neck. They often have a large medallion, usually marked with [[Runes]]. Regardless of their shape, a [[Sunfire Pectoral]] is formed of orichalcum alloyed with gold or occasionally copper, coloured and polished with [[Iridescent gloaming]], and usually with green iron alloy chains or buckles holding it in place. They are often inlaid with decorative gemstones. It is common to see a Sunfire Pectoral marked with a heraldic device in [[Dawn]], [[The League]], [[Highguard]] and [[The Marches]], but even in nations where heraldry is not common they tend to bear a symbol of either a leaping flame (especially in [[The Brass Coast]], where a particularly garishly decorated pectoral is sometimes called a ''Flav's flame'' after a notorious [[Corsair]] battle-magician) or the sun - a common symbol of the Virtue of [[Pride]].
Wearers often seem to be energetic and passionate, and are especially vocal about strongly held beliefs or philosophies. It is common for the pectoral to bear the rune [[Zorech]], which accentuates these traits.
