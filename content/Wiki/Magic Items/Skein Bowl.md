## Description
A [[Skein Bowl]] is a ceremonial tool that commonly takes the form of a metal or wooden bowl. The bowl is popular with the priests of [[Wintermark]], where it is also sometimes called a ''[[Scop]]'s Well'' or a ''[[Stormcrow]]'s Basin''. As part of a ceremony of [[Testimony]], the priest mixes a dose of [[Liao]] with a little water, oil, or even blood (the latter is especially popular with the [[Navarr]]). During the [[Testimony|testimony]], the resultant mixture is used to either physically mark the body of the ceremony or flicked towards them in cases where they are not a willing participant.
In [[Highguard]] and [[The League]], this item is called a ''[[Righteous Aspergil]]'' and takes the form of a perforated sphere on the end of a short rod. The [[Liao|liao]] is mixed and poured into the sphere, which is used to flick the resulting liquid over the target in fine droplets. In [[Urizen]], the item more commonly is called a ''Spiritwell'' and the [[Liao|liao]] is mixed with a little ink that is used to carefully trace a sigil on the hand or face of the target of the [[Testimony|testimony]] - these items have seen increasing popularity in [[The Brass Coast]] where the [[Liao|liao]] is often mixed with henna and used to trace beautiful intricate designs on the target. This has replaced a more robust version of the item, still favoured by some [[Sutannir]], called a ''Glass Bowl'' in which [[Liao|liao]] is mixed with a little spirit that is imbibed by the priest and then sprayed toward the target at the climax of the [[Ritual|ritual]].
Regardless of the exact shape it takes, it is used in religious ceremonies and directly empowers the ability of priests to mark a target's soul. It is a tool that can be used both to create indelible marks - marks which are much more durable than normal, especially where the [[Testimony|testimony]] is part of a punishment or warning - but it can also be used to [[Empower|empower]] a priest to remove such durable marks.
