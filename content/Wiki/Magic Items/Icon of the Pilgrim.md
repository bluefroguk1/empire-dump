## Description
As with some other icons, this ceremonial tool allows a priest to perform a [[Liao]] ceremony. These icons often bear images of [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] closely associated with ideas of travel and stories of service to others, but it is difficult to make definitive statements about their appearance beyond the fact that they tend to be significant religious items wielded during a ceremony.
An [[Icon of the Pilgrim|icon of the pilgrim]] is the fruit of months of work for a skilled artisan. The work often includes small amounts of the magical [[Materials|materials]], and it is very common for a crafter to use tools inlaid with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] when working on an icon. Icons of the pilgrim take their name from their use in preparing a devout traveller for a journey away from home, granting them spiritual strength when they must go into dangerous situations or even when they simply have to spend a period away from their [[Family|family]] and friends. They often take the form of an aspergil, thurible or bowl of water or oil that is used to literally anoint the body of the ceremonial subject. 
In some parts of [[Highguard]] they take the form of a polished bowl in which the priest and the pilgrim alike wash their hands, or even sometimes their feet. In [[Wintermark]], [[The Brass Coast]] and [[The League]] they commonly appear as a large chalice or goblet with which the priest and the pilgrim share a drink of wine or fresh water as part of the ceremony.
