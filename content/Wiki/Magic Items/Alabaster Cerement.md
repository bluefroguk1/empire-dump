## Description
The power of this [[Enchanted]] robe is to grant a devout wearer a great reserve of inner strength; they bank the fires of mortality, helping the wearer to endure pain and suffering that might overwhelm and kill other people. Also called variously a ''martyr's shroud'', a ''gravedigger's coat'' and a ''widow's (or widower's) gown'' these robes are modelled after the shrouds used to wrap the dead in [[Highguard]] and several other nations. 
In contrast with many other enchanted robes they tend to be sombre, with limited decoration. The cloth is bleached with beggar's lye, toughened with [[Ambergelt]], reinforced with dragonbone and finally embroidered with delicate silver threads. Outside [[The Brass Coast]] they are rarely coloured, being commonly left white rather than any other shade. 
Among the Freeborn, by stark contrast, they are usually dyed a deep red or yellow colour, and the sleeves and hems are much more likely to be ornamented with tiny gemstones. Here they are called ''flickering shrouds''; while their association with death is not denied, it is celebrated rather than mourned.
