## Description
The standard [[Cerulean Protector]] is a hauberk or cuirass of sturdy leather. In [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] these suits are made of reinforced leather scales, and are often dyed blue or green and called ''Cerulean Scale'', after the [[Herb|herb]] [[Cerulean Mazzarine|cerulean mazzarine]]. In [[Dawn]] it is often used by [[Knights-errant|knights-errant]] who rely on speed - avoiding the weight of heavy armour leaves one open to the threat of archers. 
The main advantage of this armour comes when the warrior has reduced coverage of arms or legs for some reason, especially among warriors who prefer the freedom granted by minimizing the amount of restrictive armour they are wearing. Archers particularly appreciate both the freedom of movement and the restorative power of the armour, for as it is said in [[The Marches]] there are few creatures as miserable as a one-armed archer.
[[Rhyv]], the [[Rune]] of Blood, is fairly commonly employed on this armour for its [[General|general]] healing ability, though [[Bravash]], the Rune of Fertility, is also used to encourage the bones to grow back together rapidly. The [[Runes|runes]] are often embossed into the leather, but some smiths cut the [[Mithril|mithril]] plates into the shape of the [[Runes|runes]], creating a bold form of decoration as well as anchoring the [[Enchantment|enchantment]]. Given the use of both [[Spring]] runes and the association with [[Herbs|herbs]], some suits bear elaborate floral patterning.
## Rules
Medium Armour
* Effect: You may spend a hero point to use the relentless skill as if you know it.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Cerulean Protector]] requires three ingots of [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]], six measures of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]], and three ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
The artisan looked up from his workbench, and put down his pliers.
"Ah, Wojciech, but we are not the Winterfolk to [[Fight|fight]] as [[Heroes|heroes]] before solid ranks on a clearly defined field. Not the Dawnish, with their servants to aid them. We are wardens, and we must go wherever the wicked go, follow where they lead. We must depend on ourselves, and our [[Skills|skills]], our preparation. Not on the sort of baggage train that might follow an army, with its medical supplies and chirurgeons and apothecaries."
He gestured at the half-finished hauberk on the bench, and on the pots of liquids, and stacks of rare metals that stood to one side.
"Take this armour. It does not restrict my arms, so I can [[Fight|fight]]. It is light, so it lets me run. These qualities are common to any well-crafted armour. But I have imbued it with [[Magic|magic]] to be my [[Physick|physick]], for I go where I cannot depend on one to follow. See this varnish? That is ambergelt, for healing. This caustic? Beggar's lye. These metals? [[Green iron]], weltsilver and orichalcum. With these [[Materials|materials]], I have crafted my own physician, my own support. When a cunning blow hit to a limb strikes where the armour does not cover, or where an arrow pierces, I can call on this magical protection to remain in the fight, or to run if needs be to fight another [[Day|day]]. There have been many names for it over the years. I call it essential."
