## Description
The sentinels of [[Urizen]] and the cataphracts of [[Highguard]] alike appreciate the tactical versatility granted by these powerful weapons. Whether sweeping a foe's legs out from under them, or driving an enemy back with a mighty blow and an intimidating shout, [[The Captain|the Captain]]'s Command offers a greatly enhanced range of options.
The [[Freeborn]] often call these weapons ''Tempest Blades'' because the [[Kohan|kohan]] who wield them use them to devastating effect when moving quickly through the massed ranks of opponents, spreading [[Confusion|confusion]] and scattering their enemies in disarray like powerful winds.
## Rules
Two-Handed Weapons
* Effect: You may spend a hero point to call STRIKEDOWN or [[Repel|REPEL]] with this two-handed weapon.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Captain's Command requires twelve ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], eleven ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]]. seven measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and four ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
When asked to solve the riddle of the Mysterious Knot by the adepts of ancient [[Tsark]], the sword-scholar [[Sulemaine]] simply took up her blade and cut the adepts in two.
"Mystery only exists when someone is interested," were her final words on the subject.
