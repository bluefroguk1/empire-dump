## Description
The Sentinels of [[Urizen]] and the cataphracts of [[Highguard]] alike appreciate the tactical versatility granted by these powerful weapons. Whether sweeping a foe's legs out from under them, or driving an enemy back with a mighty blow and an intimidating shout, [[The Captain]]'s Command offers a greatly enhanced range of options.
The Freeborn often call these weapons ''Tempest Blades'' because the [[Kohan]] who wield them use them to devastating effect when moving quickly through the massed ranks of opponents, spreading confusion and scattering their enemies in disarray like powerful winds.
## Rules
Two-Handed Weapons
* Effect: You may spend a hero point to call STRIKEDOWN or [[Repel]] with this two-handed weapon.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Captain's Command requires twelve ingots of tempest jade, eleven ingots of green iron. seven measures of dragonbone and four ingots of orichalcum. It takes one month to make one of these items.
When asked to solve the riddle of the Mysterious Knot by the adepts of ancient [[Tsark]], the sword-scholar [[Sulemaine]] simply took up her blade and cut the adepts in two.
"Mystery only exists when someone is interested," were her final words on the subject.
