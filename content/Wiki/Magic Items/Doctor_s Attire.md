## Description
The Doctor's Attire is a suit of magical clothing infused with a little of the power of the [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] [[Dramaturgy#The Personae|persona]] of [[The Doctor]]. A [[Rituals|ritual]] [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] who wears this clothing can draw on the power it contains to empower their ability to perform [[Winter magic]]. In addition to providing additional magical power, the robes also infuse the wearer with some of the personality of the Doctor.
In dramaturgy, the Doctor is sometimes a fearful figure. Doctors and [[Surgical skills#Physick|physicks]] are innately tied to the resonance of death, and difficult choices – yet their Wisdom also serves to stave off the Labyrinth and bring an end to suffering. This magical garment allows a bonded magician to touch that dichotomous power, and use it to strengthen their ability to wield the dangerous might of the Winter realm. It must be said, however, that using the robe is not for the faint-hearted – only those who have an intimate understanding of the paradoxes at the heart of the Winter realm should risk using the power of the Doctor's Attire.
Yet that is not to say that this raiment is some nightmarish cultish robe infused with madness and suffering. Far from it – the power of the Doctor reminds the magician that even the darkest urges can be harnessed to do good, helping them to remain centred and to resist the temptations personified by certain malign entities of the Winter realm. To do the greatest good at the cost of the least harm is sometimes seen as the highest calling of the Winter magician.
Unlike other ritual raiments, the Doctor's is rarely brightly coloured. The material is [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|bleached]] and [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|dyed]] with sober, contrasting colours, favouring sable, argent, and deep crimson. The decoration is understated and restrained, with small quantities of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and dark [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]] used to complement the stark and severe cut of the garment. Supple gloves are almost always included – the Doctor invariably wears gloves in dramaturgy.
The raiment is heavily inspired by the rich dark fabrics favoured in [[Holberg]], and among the [[Highguard|Highborn]]. Less common designs also exist however – the ''[[Navarr magical traditions|Vate's]] Semblance'' and the ''[[Varushka magical traditions#Cabalists|Cabalist's]] Robe''. The former hints at the practical aesthetics of the [[Navarr]] [[Surgical skills#Apothecary|apothecary]], with short sleeves, leather bracers, and sturdy trousers. The latter is a dark coloured hooded robe, lined with rabbit fur, and equipped with sturdy boots perfect for performing complex rites in the freezing cold of the [[Varushka|northern Empire]].
