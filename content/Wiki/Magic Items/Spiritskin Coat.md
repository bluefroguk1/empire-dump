## Description
Despite the name this 'coat' is actually armour. Usually made in several pieces of supple leather worn in layers with heavy furs, it is favoured by [[Suaq]] and [[Kallavesi]] hunters. Traditionally a [[Spiritskin Coat]] is only made from leather gathered by the hunter who will wear the armour, working by themselves in the wilds of [[Sermersuaq]]. A suit intended to be an artefact would normally be made only from the finest leather, and some artisans refuse to make a permanent Spiritskin Coat from anything other than leather the hunter has gathered from animals slain with their bare hands.
In the days before the coming of the Vard, the Ushka wore similar light leather armour which they called a ''Shadowrunner Coat''. Usually made of dark-stained leather and [[Painted]] with occult symbols designed to Ward against evil, it sees some use today by messengers who travel between the vales and for whom mobility is more important than durability. 
In [[The League]] it is often called a ''Pigskin Jacket'', and is especially favoured by the Bravos of [[Tassato]]. Other citizens of the League tend to look down on those using this serviceable light leather but in the close confines of a street [[Fight]], or for scouts who need to be able to outrun their opponents without collapsing from their wounds, it is invaluable.
