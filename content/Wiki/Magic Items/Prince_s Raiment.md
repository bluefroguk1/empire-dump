## Description
[[The Prince]]'s Raiment is a suit of magical clothing infused with a little of the power of the dramaturgical persona of [[The Prince]]. A [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magician|magician]] who wears this clothing can draw on the power it contains to [[Empower|empower]] their ability to perform [[Autumn magic]]. In addition to providing additional magical power, the robes also infuse the wearer with some of the personality of the Prince.
The Prince represents temporal authority and influence, and this magical garment allows a trained magical practitioner to experience a portion of that power and use it to better command the subtle and far-reaching potence of [[Autumn]] [[Magic|magic]]. Through the power of [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgy]], combined with elements of the potent art of girding, the magician who dons the Prince's Raiment experiences a little of the archetypal spirit of the persona. The [[Magic|magic]] of the clothing puts them in touch with their own reserves of personal power and helps strengthen their confidence in using that power to shape the world around them.
The Prince's Raiment is designed to project authority, confidence, and power. Expensive fabrics are used, carefully bleached and dyed with strong colours. It is embroidered with sungold thread and embellished with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]], polished crystal, and delicate [[Green iron|green iron]] fastenings. Typically fashioned after the rich clothing of a [[League]] Merchant-Prince or Dawnish [[Earl]], designs are also available patterned after traditional garb worn by leaders of every nation. The ''[[Dhomiro]]'s Garb'', the ''[[Thane]]'s Attire'', and the ''[[Boyar]]'s Coat'' have proved quite popular with [[Freeborn]], [[Wintermark]], and Varushkan magicians respectively. Work has recently been completed on the ''[[Arbiter]]'s Array'', a breathtakingly beautiful robe sculpted to traditional [[Urizen]] designs patterned with an incredibly delicate webwork of metal threads and dragonbone-stiffened panels. 
At the moment ([[Winter]] 380YE), House Bourn√© is encountering difficulties creating a suitable design for a Prince's Raiment that embodies the aesthetics of the [[Imperial Orcs]]' leaders. The [[Guild]] has expressed an interest in receiving suggestions from orc artisans as to what the leaders of their people would wear and how best these could be incorporated into a new design.
