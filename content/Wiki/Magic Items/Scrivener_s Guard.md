## Description
This leather cuirass is favoured by Winterfolk and [[Freeborn]] senators, diplomats, negotiators and merchants who go to dangerous places in the pursuit of their duties. It is also popular with [[Banner|banner]]-bearers and scops. In these professions, many lack the boisterous spirit found among those who thrive on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], so they often seek out inspiring weapons to accompany the armour such as a [[Triumphant Blade]].
In [[Urizen]] each piece of leather has a strand of [[Weltsilver]] thread running through in an attempt to achieve the greatest possible shine when exposed light, while an Orcish smith might gather portions of leather from her hardiest comrades before combining them to produce a patchwork armour of great [[Worth]] drawing on the resilience of all the past owners. In [[Wintermark]] and most other lands, tiny [[Runes|runes]] are engraved into the leather, usually [[Evrom]], the [[Rune|rune]] of beginnings, to give the wearer a fresh start or occasionally [[Naeve]], the rune of hunger, to drive the wearer through hardship and on to greater things. 
The Freeborn [[Emperor Ahraz]] is known to have worn a set of [[Scrivener]]'s Guard during most of his career, including his negotiations with the rebellious orc slaves. When queried about why he did not don a more powerful suit of armour he is said to have replied:
 "I am a diplomat, not a warrior. My armour is more to stop me being a burden on my bodyguards than to aid me in battle. If a [[Fight|fight]] breaks out, I [[Will|will]] do my best but I am no soldier and no amount of armour [[Will|will]] make me one. Better I save my money and spend it somewhere it [[Will|will]] do good -  on weapons and armour for those to whom I entrust my life."
## Rules
