## Description
An [[Icon of the Righteous]] allows a priest to perform ceremonies as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Courage]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a [[Paragon|paragon]] or exemplar of [[Courage]] such as [[Inga Tarn]] or [[Isaella]]. The Icon is not always a portrait - in [[Wintermark]] it is often crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the feathers and bones of jackdaws, [[Painted|painted]] with the [[Rune]] of Battle, and called either a ''Jackdaw Icon'' or a ''Thunderhead Blade''. In [[Varushka]], it is commonly crafted as a statue called variously a ''Brave Bear'' or a ''Courageous Boar.'' In some parts of [[The Marches]], the Varushkan style of Icon has proved surprisingly popular - a statuette of a boar called a ''Brave Pig'' is used by many friars. 
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Courage|auras of Courage]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to Courage who are not part of their [[Sect|sect]].
