## Description
The [[Phlegmatic Staff]] taps upon the power of the  [[Realm]] of Winter to guide the bearer to a greater understanding of the leaching of power that is involved in ritual [[Magic]]. These arcane implements are employed throughout [[The Empire]] to fortify the abilities of Winter ritualists.
It is usual to see such an implement engraved with [[Naeve]], the Rune of Hunger or [[Irremais]], the Rune of [[Wisdom]].
The staff of the [[Archmage of Winter]] is a version of the Phlegmatic Staff crafted to a secret pattern, and grants twice as much power to the wielder.
