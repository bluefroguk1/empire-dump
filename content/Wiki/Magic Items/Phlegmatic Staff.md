## Description

It is usual to see such an implement engraved with [[Naeve]], the Rune of Hunger or [[Irremais]], the Rune of Wisdom.
The [[Archmage#Staff of the Archmage|staff]] of the [[Archmage]] of Winter is a version of the [[Phlegmatic Staff]] crafted to a secret pattern, and grants twice as much power to the wielder.
