## Description
The most common form taken by [[Atun]]'s Ring is either a single band marked with one [[Rune|rune]] associated with each of the six [[Realms|realms]] or a single ring formed of six interwoven [[Bands|bands]], each of a different precious metal.
These rings are named for the [[Paragon|paragon]] [[Atun]], the sister of [[Atuman]], exemplar of [[Ambition]]. Stories indicate that Atun was a powerful [[Magician|magician]], prone to visionary experiences even without the use of [[Magic|magic]], and a mistress of multiple realms. When she departed the nascent Highborn nation she left the artefact magical ring that bore her name with her brother as a keepsake. Her followers crafted lesser rings in its image, and when the [[Freeborn]] began their exodus it is believed that all three founding sisters bore versions. The use of the rings was also widespread among the magicians of [[Tassato]] and [[Sarvos]], and three were given as gifts by Highborn [[Magisters|magisters]] to the magicians of [[Urizen]] during early diplomatic exchanges. Of these three rings, one resurfaced during the [[Summer]] Solstice 385YE in possession of the Hall of the Newborn Sun in [[Morrow]]. It was presented to the [[Imperial Conclave]] by the [[Urizen]] [[Spire]], to be endowed on the person most responsible for the destruction of [[Druj miasma]] pillars in [[Zenith]]. The [[Bursar of the Conclave]] had [[The Ring|the ring]] endowed on Caleb of the Cenotaph, [[Exarch]] of the [[Chapter]] of the same name and a renowned master of the [[Chimes of Annulment]] [[Ritual|ritual]]. The whereabouts of the other two rings are currently unknown.
The original ring would be a treasure beyond price, were it to be found, but it vanished during the tumultuous years of the Highborn civil [[War|war]]. Its last known bearer is believed to have been [[Permion]] the Lawmaker, and it was not seen again after his assassination.
