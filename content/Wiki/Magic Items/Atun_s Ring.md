## Description
The most common form taken by Atun's Ring is either a single band marked with one [[Runes|rune]] associated with each of the six realms or a single ring formed of six interwoven bands, each of a different precious metal.
These rings are named for the paragon [[Atun|Atun]], the sister of [[Atuman]], exemplar of Ambition. Stories indicate that Atun was a powerful magician, prone to visionary experiences even without the use of magic, and a mistress of multiple realms. When she departed the nascent [[Highguard|Highborn]] nation she left the artefact magical ring that bore her name with her brother as a keepsake. Her followers crafted lesser rings in its image, and when the [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] began their exodus it is believed that all three founding sisters bore versions. The use of the rings was also widespread among the magicians of [[Tassato]] and [[Sarvos]], and three were given as gifts by Highborn magisters to the magicians of [[Urizen]] during early diplomatic exchanges. Of these three rings, one resurfaced during the Summer Solstice 385YE in possession of the Hall of the Newborn Sun in [[Morrow]]. It was [[Rings and crowns#Glare of the Noonday Sun|presented]] to the [[Imperial Conclave]] by the Urizen [[Spire]], to be [[Endowment|endowed]] on the person most responsible for the destruction of [[Druj]] [[Druj miasma#Miasma Pillars|miasma pillars]] in [[Zenith]]. The [[Bursar of the Conclave]] had the ring endowed on Caleb of the Cenotaph, [[Exarch]] of the [[Chapter]] of the [[Highguard groups#The Cenotaph|same name]] and a renowned master of the [[Chimes of Annulment]] ritual. The whereabouts of the other two rings are currently unknown.
The original ring would be a treasure beyond price, were it to be found, but it vanished during the tumultuous years of the Highborn civil war. Its last known bearer is believed to have been [[Permion|Permion the Lawmaker]], and it was not seen again after his assassination.
