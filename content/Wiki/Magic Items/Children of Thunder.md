## Description
The [[Children of Thunder]] are most often a mace and a rod. Bound with green iron and inlaid with tempest jade decoration, these arcane weapons are used to strike powerful blows that drive an opponent away. 
According to some artisans, every time the weapon or the implement hits an opponent it stores a tiny portion of the energy used to strike that blow. When needed, the cumulative force is unleashed in a single stroke, hurling the enemy away. Some wielders as a consequence make a habit of striking the children of thunder against solid surfaces before a battle, in the hope that they can "build up a charge", as it were.
## Rules
Arcane Weapons
* Effect: You may spend a hero point to call [[Repel]] when you strike with this weapon or rod. You cannot use this ability if you are wearing armour.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting the Children of Thunder requires seven measures of dragonbone, seven ingots of tempest jade, and three ingots of green iron. It takes one month to make a pair of these items.
