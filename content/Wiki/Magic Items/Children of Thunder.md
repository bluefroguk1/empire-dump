## Description
The [[Children of Thunder]] are most often a [[Weapons & Armour#One-handed weapons|mace]] and a [[Weapons & Armour#Rods|rod]]. Bound with [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] and inlaid with [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]] decoration, these arcane weapons are used to strike powerful blows that drive an opponent away. 
According to some [[Crafting skills#Artisans|artisans]], every time the weapon or the implement hits an opponent it stores a tiny portion of the energy used to strike that blow. When needed, the cumulative force is unleashed in a single stroke, hurling the enemy away. Some wielders as a consequence make a habit of striking the [[Children of Thunder|children of thunder]] against solid surfaces before a battle, in the hope that they can "build up a charge", as it were.
## Rules
Arcane Weapons
* Effect: You may spend a [[Heroic skills#Hero|hero point]] to call [[Calls#REPEL|REPEL]] when you strike with this weapon or rod. You cannot use this ability if you are wearing armour.
* Materials: Crafting the [[Children of Thunder]] requires seven measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], seven ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], and three ingots of [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]]. It takes one month to make a pair of these items.
