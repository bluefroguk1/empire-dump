## Description
This valuable item is usually crafted in the form of an orb of crystal, glass, metal inlaid with tempest jade. It is infused with potent Enchantments and attuned to the [[Realm]] of Spring. A coven can use it to draw on the power contained in measures of [[Ambergelt]] and align it with their own [[Magic]], allowing them to reduce or in some cases replace the need for crystal mana when performing [[Spring rituals]].
This 'covenstone' may take the form of a bowl or chalice, but almost always a slightly irregular, organic-seeming construction. Some are studded with irregular hooks or Thorns, and handling these items without being pricked can be quite challenging. Ambergelt comes from living trees, and even after it has set hard it maintains some of the vitality of the vegetation from which it is drawn. The item is often marked with [[Runes]]; or with iMages associated with living things, especially trees and leaves, and occasionally insects. Regardless of the precise form it takes, a coven that uses it is careful to ensure that it takes [[Pride]] of place in their ceremonies - in addition to its magical functions it is a potent reminder of their unity of purpose and their coven oath. Some covens maintain that the [[Amberglass Orb]] works best when it is kept in constant contact with living creatures, and one member of the coven tends to the orb at all times, even sleeping with it.
## Rules
Paraphernalia
* Effect: Members of the coven who are performing a Spring ritual they have mastered may use ambergelt in place of crystal mana. Every two measures of ambergelt spent count as one crystal mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting an Amberglass Orb requires seven ingots of tempest jade, four ingots of Ambergelt, and three measures of dragonbone. It takes one month to make one of these items.
