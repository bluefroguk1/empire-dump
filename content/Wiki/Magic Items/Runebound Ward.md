## Description
A traditional set of [[Runebound Ward]] is crafted using mammoth hide inlaid with strands of [[Green iron]]. Finished with a trim of [[Dragonbone]], the armour allows quick movement on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], protection from savage blows ... and also inspires the wearer, feeding the fire of their soul to perform great deeds. [[Runes]] of strength are worked subtly into the overall design of the armour, along with [[Runes|runes]] of significance to the artisan or the intended wearer of the armour.
Traditionally a [[Runesmith|runesmith]] chants a heroic saga while crafting this armour, with the rhythm of the song helps [[Guide|guide]] the crafting process. In the heat of battle, some [[Runebound Ward]] wearers claim that they can hear that song echoing faintly in the [[Music|music]] of [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], drawing inspiration from the specific heroic deeds recounted in the tale. 
In [[Dawn]] Runebound Ward is commonly crafted in the form of a leather cuirass. Called ''Elfin Guard'', composed of sculpted plates of dyed leather, it is often beautifully decorated and shaped to fit a specific wearer. A fine suit of this armour is popular with [[Troubadours|troubadours]] or senators who choose to take the battlefield, even if the [[Magic|magic]] woven into it has faded.
The [[Navarr]] may wear fine Runebound Ward in the [[Wintermark]] style, but their artisans also create ''Runehide'' armour, working coiling [[Thorn|thorn]] or vine patterns into layers of thinner leather, using green iron rivets and fastenings to hold the armour snug against the body. As armour that enhances versatility and provides options, without restricting mobility over much, it is unsurprisingly popular with the thorns.
## Rules
Medium Armour
* Effect: Gain one additional hero point.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a a set of Runebound Ward requires ten ingots of green iron and four measures of dragonbone. It takes one month to make one of these items.
I'd done the best I could by then. My work was done: thick hide, cured and crafted, with [[Magic|magic]] set into the lames, and dragonbone reinforcing the weakest points. Learned the trick of it from a [[Navarr]] I met. Vasiley would have the best gear I could manage. 
I was in [[Anvil]] the [[Day|day]] his call came through. I'd been listening to some Marcher sermonising: sounded like he'd spent too long in [[Bastion]] to me. Getting winked at by an orc. Looked like a threat, to be honest. I don't think he approved me smiling when the Marcher got fiery, but my trust in the virtues is quiet, and I wonder about those who wear their faith so open. Irony of it is I was twisting a scrap of thonging round a little wooden eagle I'd carved for Vasiley at the time. The mark of [[Pride]] in [[Varushka]]. I doubt the orc would realise.
Anyway, the call came though. I added one last talisman to it; that eagle. I've heard from one of the Dawnish that she'd seen him absolutely hammer an orc to the ground during some skirmish, and butcher it as it recovered from the shock. She said those that saw just stood and cheered him. That was pay enough for a month spent drawing [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]] wire, on and off.
He swore me an oath he'd come back, so he'd better.
