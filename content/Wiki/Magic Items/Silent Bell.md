This page details the [[Magic|magic]] item; for the Vigilant association see [[Silent Bell (Sodality)]]
## Description
This valuable item of priestly regalia is generally crafted in the form of a bell, gong, or chime. In some places, especially [[Wintermark]] and [[The Brass Coast]] it may be made in the form of a small drum, or even a rattle. Despite the name, it is usually quite capable of making a noise - its common name comes from the idea that the bell is experienced on a spiritual level as well as a gross, physical level. Unlike the musical instruments that many priests use, a [[Silent Bell]] is rarely a melodious tool for creating [[Music|music]]. It is commonly for creating a discordant racket, intended to drive away malign spirits and corrupting influences.
The [[Silent Bell]] allows a lone priest, or a small group of priests, to tackle powerful curses and evil spirits that might otherwise overpower them. It is almost always hallowed with an [[Aura|aura]] that provides [[Courage]] or [[Vigilance]] in the face of spiritual corruption, even when it is intended to be wielded by a priest dedicated to a specific Virtue.
Stories from [[The Marches]] tell of a particular [[Silent Bell]] that is widely believed to be an artefact - or possibly even a blessed relic. Brian of Heathford, the husband of a farmer from the village of the same name, was a renowned cook well known for his [[Vigilance]] and [[Wisdom]]. When local gossip suggested that the misfortunes tormenting his fellow villagers were caused by the wicked spirit of a dead sorcerer, he marched down to the spirit's haunt - a burnt out mill - and led his neighbours in a three-[[Day|day]] long chorus of the rough [[Music|music]]. In the end, despite its best efforts, the ghost was sent howling back into the Labyrinth, but the stout ladle that Brian used to beat on his cook-pot for three solid days and nights without sleeping, eating, drinking, or breaking his dissonant rhythm, was handed down to his [[Children|children]] for several generations before being entrusted to the Threshers of [[Upwold]]. According to the writings of Ander [[Thresher]] in 250YE, it still possessed a potent ability to aid the ceremony of [[Exorcism|exorcism]] and was imbued with a "singular [[Aura|aura]]". Sadly the item was lost to [[The Empire|the Empire]] in 290YE during an altercation with a [[Coven|coven]] of [[Agramant]]-inspired sorcerers threatening King's Stoke. Both the [[Assembly]] of [[Vigilance]] and the Threshers of [[Upwold]] would be keen to see the item recovered and put to good use, in the event that it is still in existence.
