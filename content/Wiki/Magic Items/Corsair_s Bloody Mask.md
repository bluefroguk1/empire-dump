## Description
The [[Corsair]]'s Bloody Mask empowers the wearer to perform [[Spring magic]] enchantments that [[Empower|empower]] fleets and [[Bands|bands]] of warriors who undertake independent action at sea or on land.
Otherwise known as the ''Crimson [[Reaver]] Mask'', this talisman is often crafted to resemble a ferocious beast of the sea, spattered with the blood of its last victim; or a maniacally grinning face with blood dripping from the sides of the mouth. The mask often inspires fear in those who view it, or makes them feel uncomfortable. As with many such items, these masks are often ceremoniously disposed of after their [[Magic|magic]] begins to attenuate - in the case of the Bloody Mask it is traditional to immerse them in salt water. This is generally done by returning them to the sea, although at least one Highborn [[Chapter|chapter]] has a catacomb full of bowls of salt water in each of which lies a mask. Recreating the [[Magic|magic]] using the same mask has in the past led to tragic circumstances where the violent passions experienced by the wearer begin to linger, or become too powerful to be easily controlled. There are also stories in which a mask used repeatedly with little rest between [[Rituals|rituals]] causes bloody welts to open up on the skin beneath.
Their construction often incorporates [[Rhyv]], the [[Rune]] of Blood, especially in the context of shedding blood rather than healing wounds.
