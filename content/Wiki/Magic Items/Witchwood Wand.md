## Description
The witchwood is a soft, pliable tree that is reasonably common in [[The Empire|the Empire]]; the wood is often used to decorate fine furniture or carved to make decorative friezes, puppets and [[Children|children]]'s toys. The wood is light and easy to shape, and has been used to craft wands since time immemorial. When a magical wand of this nature is made of a different material, it is often called a ''[[Witch]]-''something'' Wand'' depending on what it is predominantly made of.
These wands are known by a variety of colloquial names - in parts of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] it might be called a ''One-more-spell Wand'', while the [[Mountebanks|mountebanks]] of [[The League|the League]] call them ''Lucky Holdouts''. It is common for magicians in many nations to give their wand a specific name, and refer to it as their ''companion'' - so in [[Varushka]] for example the wand may be referred to as a ''Cabalist's Companion''. Some especially grumpy magicians call their [[Witchwood Wand]] a ''Reliable Apprentice'' because it is always to hand and always ready to help.
## Rules
Wands
* Effect: You gain one additional point of personal mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Witchwood Wand]] requires seven measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
[[The Mountebank|The mountebank]] eyed the wand suspiciously, bending it first one way, then the other, and handed it back to the artisan in the feathered hat. “It’s a bit... bendy for a wand, isn’t it?” she said with a sniff.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about, mein frau. That’s a [[Witchwood Wand]]. It’s witchwood. It’s not bendy, it’s pliable.”
“I’m not looking for pliable, I’m looking for reliable.”
“Hey, you’re a poet and-”
“Shut up," the [[Mountebank|mountebank]] said testily, "I’m not here to banter; I’m here because Henrietta said you were the woman to talk to about wands.”
“Trust me, it’s a real wand. It’s [[Magic|magic]] ‘cos it’s got a little bit of its own mana tied up inside of it, and for a lady in a profession like yours, it’s that little bit of extra versatility that can make all the difference, am I right?”
[[The Mountebank|The mountebank]] took the wand back and felt its heft in her hand. She swung it, and the tip wobbled comically. “I’m not sure I could take it seriously.”
“It’s as reliable as the next wand, I promise you. It’s pliable for reasons of symbolism. Versatility and all that.”
“Yes, you said that already. But what I still don’t know is-” she gave it another swing, and watched it whip briefly out of shape, “-why is it bendy?”
The artisan sighed. Some customers just didn’t want to be satisfied. “Because it’s made of witchwood, mein frau, and there’s a queue out [[The Door|the door]] for these things if you’re not interested.”
