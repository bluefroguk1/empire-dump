## Description
Setting out to create one of these great steel or [[Mithril]] axes can be a daunting proposition given the sheer amount of [[Materials]] required to create them. Also known as a ''Sundering Axe'', their most common form is that of a great daneaxe wielded by a Varushkan or [[Wintermark]] Warrior, although they are also popular in some parts of Marches. Woodcutterâ€™s Axes are often engraved with [[Yoorn]], the Rune of Ending or [[Kyrop]], the Rune of [[Weakness]].
In [[The League]], there is a tradition of making these weapons in the form of heavy, thick bladed greatswords colloquially called ''Butterknives'' - a waggish reference to [[The Way]] the weapons cut through steel as if it was butter. For a similar reason, some Marcher or Navarri warriors refer to them as ''Hotknives''. The greatsword incarnation of this weapon is often marked with the rune [[Hirmok]], representing its dominance over other tools of [[War]].
