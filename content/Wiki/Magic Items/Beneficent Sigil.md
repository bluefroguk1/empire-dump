## Description
A [[Beneficent Sigil]] normally takes the form of an amulet or talisman of bleached dragonbone, or of carefUlly treated beggarwood inlaid with dragonbone. Normally one side will be carved with an intricate labyrinth or maze, while the other bears a symbol of particular significance to the person who wields it. The labyrinth mark is not universal. In [[Dawn]], the amulet is likely to bear an iMage of a sun, usually rising or setting, giving the amulet the common name of a ''Sunrise Talisman''. In [[Wintermark]], an artisan often replaces the labyrinth with an appropriate rune or circle of [[Runes]] - often [[Verys]] (representing strength) and [[Yoorn]] (ending a [[Curse]]). In [[The Brass Coast]] these amulets are usually inlaid with golden flames, and are referred to as ''Goldfire Coins''.
A Beneficent Sigil allows a priest to unravel certain minor curses that would normally not be susceptible to a [[Liao]] ceremony. It is only useful to a priest trained in the ceremony of [[Exorcism]]. When such a priest wishes to use it, they consume a dose of Liao and uses the talisman to focus their thoughts, allowing them to perceive an effect that weakens an allies' body or spirit and burn it away. The effect is more focused than a [[Purify]] spell cast by a magician, but slightly more powerful - it allows the removal of [[Weakness]] that would normally resist a simple incantation provided that it could in theory be removed by a dose of [[Bladeroot]].
The precise workings of the talisman are a matter for conjecture; the common belief is that the priest destroys the connection between the effect and the target's body  with their knowledge of exorcism and the power of the [[Magic]] item, while simultaneously strengthening the patient's soul with the power of Liao and their own spiritual power (using similar connections to those employed in the [[Dedication]] ceremony).
## Rules
Regalia
* Effect: When you use the Exorcism skill you may remove the WEAKNESS condition from a target rather than exorcising a spiritual effect.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Beneficent Sigil requires five measures of beggar's lye and five measures of dragonbone. It takes one month to make one of these items.
