## Description
Most often crafted as a pair of maces, these weapons are based on a design originally used by the [[Barbarian]] orcs.
The [[Warden]] fellowships of [[Varushka]] favour them to thin out the ranks of their enemies, should they find themselves outnumbered or surrounded. Particularly famed for their use was the Brotherhood of Thunder who all bore these weapons and used them to [[Fight|fight]] the wolf swarms of [[Miekarova]]. They were well-known for triumphing in the face of overwhelming numbers through judicious use of these weapons. 
[[Earthquake Drummers]] are also found among the Frayed of [[Wintermark]] who use them much as the [[Barbarian|barbarian]] orcs did, charging the enemy before the battle lines meet in hopes of causing as much chaos among their foes as possible. Weapons made for this purpose sometimes bear [[Mawrig]], the [[Rune]] of Storms and Disaster, as a symbol of their ill-fated owners and the chaos they hope to sow among their enemies.
Stretcher-bearers and field doctors with some martial skill appreciate these weapons as a form of defence when at work on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], earning them the name ''Doctor's Orders''.
## Rules
Paired Weapons
* Effect: You can call [[Repel|REPEL]] against a target you hit with both weapons simultaneously by spending a hero point.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a pair of [[Earthquake Drummers]] requires ten ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] and seven ingots of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make a pair of these items.
"...so you had formed a shield-wall, according to practise?"
The young [[Guardian|guardian]] stood bolt upright, a bead of sweat forming on his brow. 
"Yes, ma'am. The [[Unconquered|unconquered]] with us came through the line, the sergeant commanding called the order, we closed ranks and locked."
"...and you joined the second rank? And what happened next, may I enquire?" 
"Yes, ma'am. The orcs came, ma'am, and we faced them off. Shield to defend myself against any pikes in their second rank, sword to attack the orc charging the guardian to my front and left. As it is written." 
"...and then?"
"A guardian in the front rank near me called a [[Challenge|challenge]] to the largest of the orcs, who came straight at them, ma'am. "
"...do carry on..."
"The orc was carrying two hammers, ma'am. Shouldn't have been much trouble to an experienced shieldmaiden. [[Barbarians]] armed like that usually concentrate of beating your shield away, and don't bother with the parry that much. But this one had some [[Magic|magic]] on them. Battered her shield for a second, no longer, then she was barrelling backwards through the ranks, causing an awful mess. That first orc came through the gap in the line, and others followed. It caught her on the ground, and smashed her face in, begging your pardon ma'am."
"In [[The Empire|the Empire]] we call such weapons "Earthquake Drummers". A few in [[Wintermark]] carry then, a [[Warden|warden]] or two also. I have heard worse. And seen such errors before. That is not [[Courage]], that is foolishness.  And how many others fell?"
"I do not know ma'am. A fair few."
"And you left your assigned position, am I right?"
"Yes, ma'am. I ignored the orcs who'd broken the line, and stepped into the gap in the front rank, ma'am. The front line must stand as one, and others would kill those who'd come through."
"[[Magic]] is a fact of [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]], is it our response that marks us as [[Heroes|heroes]]. You are accepted as a [[Cataphract|cataphract]]. Congratulations."
