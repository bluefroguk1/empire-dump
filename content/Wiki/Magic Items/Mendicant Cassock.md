## Description
A cassock is an ankle-length robe especially popular with priests of [[Highguard]] and [[The League]]. Among the priests of [[Varushka]] and the [[Navarr]] it is more likely to be a long coat, usually of stout wool with simple embroidery, and both nations tend to call it a ''[[Guide]]'s Coat'' (albeit with slightly different implications). It may be tight or loose-fitting, and while it is often sumptuously dyed in rich colours with gold, silver or [[Mithril|mithril]] embroidery, the [[Mendicant Cassock]] tends to be a much more utilitarian garment. Generally a [[Mendicant Cassock]] is of a singe colour, and styled for comfort and practicality rather than ostentation. Only in [[The Brass Coast]] are these vestments likely to be brightly coloured, if only because of the negative associations with black or white clothing.
Despite its simplicity, the power of the Mendicant Cassock is not to be discounted. It allows a priest to perform a small number of ceremonies without the use of [[Liao]], which can be an especial boon to priests without access to a [[Congregation]], or whose primary focus is on the politics of the [[Imperial Synod]] rather than the accumulation of this precious substance. Traditionally, wealthy priests have looked down on those who rely on a Mendicant's Cassock - the [[Assembly|assembly]] of [[Prosperity]] in particular has [[Gone|gone]] through periods in which priests relying on this [[Magic|magic]] item were actively disdained.
The Mendicant Cassock is quite limited - it provides the equivalent of only a single dose of [[Liao|liao]] to a single ceremony each [[Day|day]]. If a priest wishes to take advantage of abilities to create stronger auras, they [[Will|will]] still require some actual liao. It is valuable, however, in that it is equally useful to a priest who performs a ceremony by themselves as to members of a [[Sect|sect]] not all of whose members participate in [[The Synod|the Synod]].
The use of this vestment is not restricted to Imperial priests. It is known in the [[Sumaah Republic]], where it is treated in much the same way it is in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. By contrast, in some [[Foreign Nations|foreign nations]] where liao is difficult to acquire, the priests value this item considerably more than their Imperial counterparts do. In [[Jarm]] and Sarcophan, followers of [[The Way|the Way]] must often rely on garments such as this to perform ''any'' religious ceremonies due to the difficulty of securing liao at a reasonable price. There are likewise stories of certain Axou spiritualists and Asavean slaves making use of similar items in their pursuit of spiritual power.
