## Description
An [[Icon of the Seer]], like some other icons, is Generally a ceremonial tool that allows a priest to perform a [[Liao]] ceremony they have not personally mastered. Sometimes called an ''Icon of the High Tower'', they often bear symbols associated with [[Wisdom]] or [[Vigilance]], or the iMages of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] who showed great [[Insight]] or clarity of thought, especially The [[The Sentinel]]. In parts of [[Highguard]], the item is called an Icon of the High Tower and takes the form of a tall, thin tower carved with eyes, or an ''Icon of the Beacon'', which depicts a lighthouse rather than a tower. Freeborn, [[Navarr]] and [[Urizen]] alike may wield an ''Icon of the Clear Sky''. For various reasons they often take the form of a stout walking stick or rod with a sphere of clear gemstone, polished metal sphere or crystal set into one end.
An Icon of the [[Seer]] requires months of work by a skilled artisan, commonly with a set of tools inlaid with dragonbone used especially for crafting religious items. They often including trace amounts of the Magical [[Materials]], especially tempest jade and weltsilver.
