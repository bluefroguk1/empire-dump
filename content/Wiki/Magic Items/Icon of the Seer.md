## Description
An [[Icon of the Seer]], like some other icons, is generally a ceremonial tool that allows a priest to perform a [[Liao]] ceremony they have not personally mastered. Sometimes called an ''[[Icon of the High Tower]]'', they often bear symbols associated with [[Wisdom]] or [[Vigilance]], or the images of [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragons and exemplars]] who showed great [[Insight|insight]] or clarity of thought, especially [[The Sentinel|the sentinel]]. In parts of [[Highguard]], the item is called an Icon of the High Tower and takes the form of a tall, thin tower carved with eyes, or an ''Icon of the Beacon'', which depicts a lighthouse rather than a tower. [[Freeborn]], [[Navarr]] and [[Urizen]] alike may wield an ''Icon of the Clear Sky''. For various reasons they often take the form of a stout walking stick or rod with a sphere of clear gemstone, polished metal sphere or crystal set into one end.
An Icon of the [[Seer]] requires months of work by a skilled artisan, commonly with a set of tools inlaid with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] used especially for crafting religious items.
