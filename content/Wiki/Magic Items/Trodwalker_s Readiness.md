## Description
The warrior with magical abilities or the [[Magician|magician]] with the confidence and inner fire to be a true hero both benefit from the use of these arcane weapons. Both weapon and implement are often marked with mirrored spirals, or designs reminiscent of the [[Trods]] that the [[Navarr]] walk. 
There are many stories that suggest that the weapons occasionally channel additional strength to their wielders when they are employed in the vicinity of a [[Trod|trod]], although there may be other explanations for this phenomenon (if it even exists - all the evidence so far is anecdotal). Obscure stories from the earliest days of the pre-Imperial [[Navarr]] suggest that these weapons were wielded by some form of elite Terunael champion, one who embraced both warfare and arcane study. There is some evidence to support this - relic hunters have uncovered more than one sets of these weapons in old burial grounds or [[Vallorn]]-choked ruins. Presumably, the items went by a different name in the days before the trods were established.
These weapons are not common in [[The Empire|the Empire]] - the [[Skills|skills]] needed to use them are rare. One must not only possess personal discipline and [[Magical skills|magical skills]], but also the training needed to do something useful with that discipline and [[Magic|magic]] before one can get good use out of these items. They are somewhat more common in the hands of [[Urizen]] magicians who [[Fight|fight]] alongside the sentinels.
