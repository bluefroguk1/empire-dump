## Description
The Warrior with Magical abilities or the magician with the confidence and inner fire to be a true hero both benefit from the use of these arcane weapons. Both weapon and implement are often marked with mirrored Spirals, or designs reminiscent of the Trods that the [[Navarr]] walk. 
There are many stories that suggest that the weapons occasionally channel additional strength to their wielders when they are employed in the vicinity of a [[Trod]], although there may be other explanations for this phenomenon (if it even exists - all the evidence so far is anecdotal). Obscure stories from the Earliest days of the pre-Imperial Navarr suggest that these weapons were wielded by some form of elite Terunael champion, one who embraced both warfare and arcane study. There is some evidence to support this - relic hunters have uncovered more than one sets of these weapons in old burial grounds or [[Vallorn]]-choked Ruins. Presumably, the items went by a different name in the days before the trods were established.
These weapons are not common in [[The Empire]] - the Skills needed to use them are rare. One must not only possess personal discipline and [[Magical skills]], but also the training needed to do something useful with that discipline and [[Magic]] before one can get good use out of these items. They are somewhat more common in the hands of [[Urizen]] magicians who [[Fight]] alongside The Sentinels.
