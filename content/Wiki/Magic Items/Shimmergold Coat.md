## Description
These beautiful long coats are usually worked with [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]]-and-gold thread, and dyed vibrant, [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent colours]]. They are popular with folk from all walks of life, offering a level of protection similar to that granted by armour but without the weight or restriction on movement or magic. They are particularly popular with senators and priests, but they are also worn by wealthy individuals such as physicians or magicians who regularly travel to dangerous locations or fear assassination.
This coat was most famously owned by the dashing [[Mountebank]] Joaozinho Andre di Tassato, whose foolhardy daring has been immortalised by numerous songs and play. Although a highly accomplished ritualist, he was well-known for charging head-long into brawls and battles armoured in only his distinctive purple [[Shimmergold Coat]], much to the distress of his companions. ''Purple-Coated'' is a slang term used by some [[Free Company|Free Companies]] of [[Tassato]] to refer to foolhardy bravery.
Although the benefit of the enchantment is clear, many who live in the wilds find the garish colouring of these robes challenging. Shimmergold robes of [[Navarr]]i or [[Suaq]] manufacture are more commonly long tunics worn under other layers or occasionally linings sewn into furs. These are known as ''Summer-Plume Shirts'' and are appreciated by scouts across the Empire. A few Shimmergold Coats are even reversible, allowing the owner to flip between subtle and showy sides.
