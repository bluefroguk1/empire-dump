## Description
Purified with beggar's lye, the materials used to craft [[Twilight Pauldrons|twilight pauldrons]] are carefully coloured and woven with threads dyed with iridescent gloaming. This potent suit of mage armour greatly increases the number of spells the wearer can cast.
All the magical materials needed for this suit can be found in the forests of the Empire. It is said that the first set of pauldrons was made either for or by [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|Star]], one of the first [[Navarr|Navarri]] [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|Vates]], when the remnants of [[Navarr history|Terunael]]â€™s defenders fled into the forests. It served as a symbol of how the wilds contained power that the resistance could use to their advantage. This first suit was dyed a twilight blue and decorated with flecks which sparkled like stars. The celestial theme is found elsewhere. Suits made in [[Urizen]] often bear a design of a large star surrounded by six smaller stars, representing the world and the six magical realms, as well as reminding the wearer of the [[Net of the Heavens]].
Bonding to these suits has been linked to bursts of arrogance, but it has been impossible to tell whether this is an effect of the bond or a natural consequence of such an increase in personal power. In peaceful or well-defended regions, [[Ashen Mantle|Ashen Mantle]]s are more popular among the most powerful magicians, thus donning this armour in such places is considered a statement of over-dedication to the arts of war. Meanwhile in border regions under active attacks, powerful mages who stick to [[Ashen Mantle|Ashen Mantle]]s are seen as a little naive or shirking their duties in battle.
## Rules
Mage Armour
* Effect: You gain four additional points of personal mana.
* Materials: Crafting [[Twilight Pauldrons|twilight pauldrons]] requires five ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], three ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]],  five measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]], three measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], and fifteen measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]],   and. It takes one month to make one of these items.
It had, he reflected, been a perfectly normal meeting of the Senate. It seemed now to be quite a trivial matter. How should magic be best used in the Empire's campaigns? The Senator for Casinea had been going on and on about the importance of ritual magic in a support role. 
He'd been speaking for the front-line battle-mage. In his old green robe, as usual. Nothing showy, nothing over-decorated. Just a plain green robe. Like a barbarian might wear, they said, when they thought he wasn't listening. 
***''And hand raised to the Net of Heavens, and pull down the power...''***
The smoke had been choking, he remembered.  Maybe some beggarwood had got in to the pile outside? Then, of course, the messenger had pushed his way in and suddenly a simple debate became a tumult. She'd called for silence, and he'd read the message. When she asked: "Who's with us?", he'd clasped his hands in agreement to what had become a unanimous decision. After a short pause for effect, of course.
***''And turn, and swing, and drive the orc away...''***
He'd gone outside and called over a  friend from the Brass Coast to help his shrug his old green robe off. To reveal his full mage armour beneath. He rather suspected no one realised he always wore it to Senate meetings. Not because he thought he might need the extra power from the [[Twilight Pauldrons]] he'd been give to mark his election as Senator for Morrow, but to remind himself that he was a battle-mage, first and foremost. 
Here is where he's most at home. To feel the touch of perfection in battle. To strive for arete over the bodies of the Empire's enemies.
***''And that orc falls into two others, and you've time for a smile before the next one...''***
