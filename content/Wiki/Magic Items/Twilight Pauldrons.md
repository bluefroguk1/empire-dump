## Description
Purified with beggar's lye, the [[Materials|materials]] used to craft [[Twilight Pauldrons|twilight pauldrons]] are carefully coloured and woven with threads dyed with [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. This potent suit of [[Mage|mage]] armour greatly increases the number of spells the wearer can cast.
All the magical [[Materials|materials]] needed for this suit can be found in the forests of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. It is said that the first set of pauldrons was made either for or by Star, one of the first Navarri Vates, when the remnants of Terunaelâ€™s defenders fled into the forests. It served as a symbol of how the wilds contained power that the resistance could use to their advantage. This first suit was dyed a twilight blue and decorated with flecks which sparkled like stars. The celestial theme is found elsewhere. Suits made in [[Urizen]] often bear a design of a large star surrounded by six smaller stars, representing the world and the six magical [[Realms|realms]], as well as reminding the wearer of the [[Net of the Heavens]].
Bonding to these suits has been linked to bursts of arrogance, but it has been impossible to tell whether this is an effect of the bond or a natural consequence of such an increase in personal power. In peaceful or well-defended regions, Ashen Mantles are more popular among the most powerful magicians, thus donning this armour in such places is considered a statement of over-[[Dedication|dedication]] to the arts of [[War|war]]. Meanwhile in border regions under active attacks, powerful mages who stick to Ashen Mantles are seen as a little naive or shirking their duties in battle.
## Rules
[[Mage Armour]]
* Effect: You gain four additional points of personal mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting [[Twilight Pauldrons|twilight pauldrons]] requires five ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], three ingots of [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]],  five measures of beggar's lye, three measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]], and fifteen measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]],   and. It takes one month to make one of these items.
It had, he reflected, been a perfectly normal meeting of [[The Senate|the Senate]]. It seemed now to be quite a trivial matter. How should [[Magic|magic]] be best used in [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s campaigns? The [[Senator]] for [[Casinea]] had been going on and on about the importance of [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magic|magic]] in a support role. 
He'd been speaking for the front-line battle-[[Mage|mage]]. In his old green robe, as usual. Nothing showy, nothing over-decorated. Just a plain green robe. Like a [[Barbarian|barbarian]] might wear, they said, when they thought he wasn't listening. 
***''And hand raised to the Net of Heavens, and pull down the power...''***
The smoke had been choking, he remembered.  Maybe some beggarwood had got in to the pile outside? Then, of course, the messenger had pushed his way in and suddenly a simple debate became a tumult. She'd called for silence, and he'd read the message. When she asked: "Who's with us?", he'd clasped his hands in agreement to what had become a unanimous decision. After a short pause for effect, of course.
***''And turn, and swing, and drive the orc away...''***
He'd [[Gone|gone]] outside and called over a  friend from [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] to help his shrug his old green robe off. To reveal his full [[Mage|mage]] armour beneath. He rather suspected no one realised he always wore it to [[Senate]] meetings. Not because he thought he might need the extra power from the [[Twilight Pauldrons]] he'd been give to mark his election as [[Senator]] for [[Morrow]], but to remind himself that he was a battle-[[Mage|mage]], first and foremost. 
Here is where he's most at home. To feel the touch of perfection in battle. To strive for [[Arete|arete]] over the bodies of [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s enemies.
***''And that orc falls into two others, and you've time for a smile before the next one...''***
