## Description
A Watcher's Flute allows a priest to use a musical performance to draw on the power of the [[Auras of Vigilance#Consecration|consecration]] of [[Vigilance]] to inspire their audience. Listeners are filled with a profound sense the need to protect others, and the importance of actively rooting out threats to their friends and family. The power of the magical musical instrument itself is only part of the process that brings about this spiritual experience - the performance itself helps connect the spirit of the audience with the power of the potent consecrated aura. 
One of these items often takes the form of a delicate instrument that plays quiet music - a flute, or a harp are common forms. Such instruments reward quiet contemplation, and careful listening - and they are often used in a quite formal performance where an audience actively listens to the priest's music. In [[Wintermark]], Vigilance is represented by [[Ophis]], and this [[Runes|rune]] is often worked into the decoration of the instrument.
It is very common for a priest to include a short sermon in their performance, reminding the audience of the dangers of complacency and the importance of virtuous action in defence of loved ones and home.
As with many religious [[Magic Items]], it is common for a Watchers Flute to be [[Hallow|hallowed]]. A popular choice is the [[Auras of Vigilance#Hallowing of the Bell|Hallowing of the Bell]] - a priest with such an instrument may focus their performance around a particular threat and work to rouse their audience in opposition to it.
