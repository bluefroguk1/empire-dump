## Description
A Watcher's Flute allows a priest to use a musical performance to draw on the power of the [[Consecration|consecration]] of [[Vigilance]] to inspire their audience. Listeners are filled with a profound sense the need to protect others, and the importance of actively rooting out threats to their friends and [[Family|family]]. The power of the magical musical instrument itself is only part of the process that brings about this spiritual experience - the performance itself helps connect the spirit of the audience with the power of the potent consecrated [[Aura|aura]]. 
One of these items often takes the form of a delicate instrument that plays quiet [[Music|music]] - a flute, or a harp are common forms. Such instruments reward quiet contemplation, and careful listening - and they are often used in a quite formal performance where an audience actively listens to the priest's [[Music|music]]. In [[Wintermark]], [[Vigilance]] is represented by [[Ophis]], and this [[Rune|rune]] is often worked into the decoration of the instrument.
It is very common for a priest to include a short sermon in their performance, reminding the audience of the dangers of complacency and the importance of virtuous action in defence of loved ones and home.
As with many religious [[Magic Items]], it is common for a Watchers Flute to be hallowed. A popular choice is the Hallowing of the Bell - a priest with such an instrument may focus their performance around a particular threat and work to rouse their audience in opposition to it.
