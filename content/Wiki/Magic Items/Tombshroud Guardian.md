## Description
The [[Tombshroud Guardian]] is most often made of heavy segmented leather finished with [[Ambergelt]] resin and carefUlly inlaid with weltsilver. It sees most use by scouts, spies, merchants, and others who find themselves operating for long periods of time in potentially dangerous situations. There is a tradition for sets of the armour crafted and sold in Crown's Quay to be Hallowed by priests of [[Vigilance]] especially when being used by [[Fleet]] captains trading in [[Foreign ports]]. According to popular belief, when the armour is used dead spirits who have yet to pass into the labyrinth of ages are drawn to the wearer and offer a little of their essence to revitalise the wearer in whatever battle they are engaged.
Building on these legends, the [[Imperial Orcs]] call this armour a ''Shaman's Beacon''. They claim that when they call on the revitalizing energy bound into the armour their renewed energy comes from their ancestors, and they often hear them more clEarly than normal when they evoke its power.
