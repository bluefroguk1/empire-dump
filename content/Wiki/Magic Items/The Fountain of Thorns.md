## Description
[[The Fountain of Thorns]] is a very powerful [[Ritual|ritual]] tool attuned to the swirling [[Magic|magic]] of the [[Spring]] [[Realm|realm]]. While many are crafted in the shape of a wooden or bone spheres or orbs, it is much more likely that the item takes the form of a bowl, cauldron or chalice. As with many items associated with the [[Spring Realm|Spring realm]], it tends to have an organic look, as if it were grown rather than shaped by craft. Many items are irregular, and most have small [[Thorn|thorn]]- or hook-like protrusions scattered at random across their surface. 
During [[Rituals|rituals]] [[The Fountain|the Fountain]] of Thorns often plays a central role, a powerful reminder of the magical power a [[Coven|coven]] wields. As with the less-powerful Green World when in the form of a bowl or chalice, it is often filled with liquid at the beginning of a ritual and passed around, each member of the coven drinking from it or adding a drop of blood to it in turn. Even when it is crafted in another form, it is common for ritualists to anoint it with their own blood during a ritual, pricking their finger on its thorns or cutting their palms with a ritual knife. Especially among the [[Navarr]], a Fountain of Thorns is likely to be stained with blood after only a handful of uses. By contrast the magicians of [[Highguard]] and [[Urizen]] are often careful to keep the item clean, washing it in fresh water after every use to prevent it darkening and (if some stories are to be believed) malignant.  
A Fountain of Thorns is usually only marked with [[Wintermark]] [[Runes|runes]] if it is crafted for the use of a Winterfolk coven. More traditionally, they are inscribed with representations of the [[Constellations|constellations]] of [[The Fountain]] or [[The Claw]].
