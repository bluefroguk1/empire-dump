## Description
These tools allow an artisan to extend their ability to deal with the bonds that all [[Enchanted]] items require. They most often take the form of a small pair of shears, scissors or snips, depending on the [[Materials]] the artisan works with. Some traditional crafters - especially in [[Wintermark]], [[Varushka]] and among the [[Navarr]] - favour rune-carved blades, with which they inflict a tiny nick on a person whose bond they are severing. Often a little of the blood is used to sketch the rune [[Evrom]] on the item, assuming both owner and item are present. 
Whatever form they take, [[Lodestone Shears]] are usually made of heavy metal and Generally marked with the Rune of Ending.
