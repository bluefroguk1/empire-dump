## Description
This six-foot spear is usually made of blackened ash-wood, with an [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]]-iron alloy head, generally shaped like a leaf, and kept at razor sharpness. They were popular with the Vard, and used extensively during their conquest of the land that is now [[Varushka]]. The spear has largely fallen out of use, but it is still popular in some of the more isolated vales where warriors armed with a [[Razorleaf Hasta]] and a round shield support heavily armoured [[Schlacta|schlacta]] in defending their homes against certain monstrous threats, especially husks.
Beyond [[Varushka]], the spear is used by many [[Navarr]] [[Brands|brands]] who are not also warriors, and by some Highborn cataphracts who still practice an adapted form of the one-handed spear and shield fighting style their ancestors used from horseback.
