## Description
The [[Icon of the Devoted]] allows a priest to perform [[Religious skills|ceremonies]] as if they were [[Dedication|dedicated]] to the virtue of [[Loyalty]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragon or exemplar]] of Loyalty such as [[Bolstering Bill (Exemplar)|Bolstering Bill]]. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of hawks and falcons, generally decorated with the [[Lann|Rune of Bargains]], which is known as an ''Icon of the Hawk''. In [[Varushka]], the icon commonly takes the form of a statuette of a dog and is known as a ''Loyal Hound''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - from the beautifully [[The Brass Coast culture and customs#Art|calligraphed]] scrolls of [[The Brass Coast]] to the delicately embroidered [[Dawn hearth magic#Favours|favours]] of [[Dawn]], the only constant is that the [[Icon of the Devoted]] be a piece of art that inspire the bearer with the essence of Loyalty.
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to [[Religious skills#Performing a Ceremony|perform]] ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Aura|auras]] of Loyalty in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to [[Religious skills#Cooperation|cooperate]] with priests dedicated to Loyalty who are not part of their [[Bands#Sects|sect]].
