## Description
The [[Icon of the Devoted]] allows a priest to perform ceremonies as if they were dedicated to the virtue of [[Loyalty]]. It generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a [[Paragon|paragon]] or exemplar of [[Loyalty]] such as [[Bolstering Bill]]. The Icon is not always a portrait, however - in [[Wintermark]] it is sometimes crafted in the form of a medallion or short rod decorated with the bones and feathers of hawks and falcons, generally decorated with the [[Rune]] of Bargains, which is known as an ''Icon of the Hawk''. In [[Varushka]], the icon commonly takes the form of a statuette of a dog and is known as a ''Loyal Hound''. Other less common variants are certainly possible - from the beautifully calligraphed scrolls of [[The Brass Coast]] to the delicately embroidered favours of [[Dawn]], the only constant is that the [[Icon of the Devoted]] be a piece of art that inspire the bearer with the essence of Loyalty.
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Loyalty|auras of Loyalty]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to Loyalty who are not part of their [[Sect|sect]].
