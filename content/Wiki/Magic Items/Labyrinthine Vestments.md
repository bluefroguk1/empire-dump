## Description
A labyrinthine vestment is a sturdy robe or tunic, often with a hood, that allows a priest to use significantly greater amounts of [[Liao]] when performing a [[Religious skills|spiritual ceremony]]. Through use of one of these robes, a lone priest can greatly increase the [[Religious skills#Ceremony Strength|strength]] of their ceremonies, either to create a powerful and durable [[Aura]], a lasting [[Excommunication]] or [[Testimony]], or to overcome or [[Exorcism|exorcise]] a potent [[Malign Spiritual Presences|malignant]] spiritual aura or curse. 
Quite apart from the spiritual power it grants, a Labyrinthine Vestment also represents the investment of dozens of ingots and measures. A set of [[Labyrinthine Vestments]] are significantly more expensive that a [[Wayfarer's Robe]], and thus more likely to be worn by a powerful and influential priest of the [[Imperial Synod]] than a mendicant adventurer. 
The traditional design for one of these garments is a simple robe of a single colour covered with intricate [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]]-and-[[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] embroidery in the form of swirling or angular maze. This design is by no means universal however. In [[The League]] it is commonly called a ''cardinal's robe'' or ''bishop's robe'' - and rather than subtle embroidery the [[Crafting skills#Artisans|artisans]] who weave them often go out of their way to stress how valuable the robe is and how prestigious the wearer is. Some priests of [[Prosperity]] and [[Pride]] see ownership of one of these glorious garments as a sign of their virtue, taking inspiration from the item itself; others view it as a powerful adjunct to their ceremonial abilities. Both schools of thought can appreciate the beautiful dyes, sumptuous fabrics and precious metals that augment and ornament the splendid vestment.
As with many [[Magic Items]] that are of use to a priest, a set of [[Labyrinthine Vestments]] is often [[Hallow|hallowed]]. Common hallows include [[Auras of Ambition#Hallowing of the Masquerade|Hallowing of the Masquerade]] or [[Auras of Ambition#Hallowing of Aldones|Aldones]], the [[Auras of Pride#Hallowing of The Throne|Hallowing of the Throne]], or the [[Auras of Courage#Hallowing of Brass|Hallowing of Brass]].
## Rules

* Roleplaying Effect: While wearing this robe bodily discomforts like hunger, thirst, or exhaustion feel muted and distant
* Materials: Crafting a labyrinthine vestment requires five ingots of [[Materials#Weltsilver|Weltsilver]], five ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], eleven measures of [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]], nine measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|Iridescent gloaming]], and fourteen measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
