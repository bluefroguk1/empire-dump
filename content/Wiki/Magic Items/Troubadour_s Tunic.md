## Description
A ''[[Troubadour]]'s tunic'', ''templar's cucUlla'', or a ''[[Sutannir]]'s coat'' (in [[Dawn]], [[Highguard]], and [[The Brass Coast]] respectively) is an ornamented priestly garment that helps the wearer connect with their inner reserves of passion and personal power. Both [[Navarr]] and Varushkan priests favour a more subdued coat, with a brightly coloured and decorated interior - not because they are modest, or afraid of calling attention to themselves, but because it allows them to move among the people unremarked until it is time for them to take action. Regardless of form, this vestment is heavily reinforced with pieces of dragonbone, which help to connect the priest to their own reserves of inner strength.
The vestment Generally appeals to two distinct priestly paths. More martial priests wear it beneath their armour when they take [[The Battlefield]], sometimes in conjunction with a weapon such as an Apprentice's Blade, [[Thresher]]'s Cudgel, or Butcher's Cleaver. Others draw on the power it offers to help them endure dangerous urges or to inSpire and protect their allies.
As with many such [[Magic Items]] intended for the use of priests, a Troubadours Tunic is often Hallowed to over additional spiritual strength to the wearer. Common choices include Hallowing of the Shepherd, the Hallowing of [[Isaella]]'s Resolve or Ashwine's Rose, or the Hallowing of the [[Unconquered]].
