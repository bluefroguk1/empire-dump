### Description
Unlike many other magical standards, a Chirurgeon's Ensign tends to be a single stark colour with a simple design on it. Many of these banners are blood-red, snow-white, or solid-black with a simple image such as the [[Rhyv|rune of blood]], the silhouette of a [[Wintermark culture and customs#Birds and feathers|bird]] or [[Varushka religious beliefs#The Virtuous Animals|virtuous animal]], or a symbol representative of healing such as a cup or goblet. In some places, especially among the [[Highguard|Highborn]], these magical standards are called ''Sorrow's Stanchion'' or (much more rarely) ''Memoriam Mortis'' (memories of death). They are sometimes a sign that a regiment or army has suffered a terrible loss at some point in the past, one where many soldiers died. For several decades after their near destruction at the hands of the [[Druj]] during the reign of [[Empress Varkula]], the [[General]] of the [[Highguard military concerns#The Granite Pillar|Granite Pillar]] fought beneath a Chirurgeon's Ensign.
The magical standard is also popular with some [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]], who call it ''Death's Challenge'' and often rally their allies with songs and shouts that mock the foolishness of death and the ability of the living to outwit him or her. More stoic warrior-physicians, especially the [[Wintermark military concerns#Grimnir|grimnir]] of [[Wintermark]], also favour these standards - they were common among [[Wintermark culture and customs#Art and history|scops]] who supported the soldiers of the [[Wintermark military concerns#The Bloodcloaks|Bloodcloaks]] army before their destruction by the [[Thule]]. The ensign is not universally popular however - it cannot be denied that culturing an awareness of the fragility of life in the banner bearer can lead to dangerous levels of empathy for the dying - even for enemies. The urge to wrestle Death that the banner creates in its bearers can lead to them being "distracted" ensuring the fallen on ''both'' sides of a conflict survive - which can be a mixed blessing.
Only those who already have a certain passionate fire can tap into the power of a Chirurgeon's Ensign. It is common for such banner bearers to be equipped with potions such as [[Philtres of War#Skop.27s Mead|Skop's Mead]] that replenish their [[Heroic skills#Extra Hero Points|inner reserves]].
