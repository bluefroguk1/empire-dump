### Description
Unlike many other magical standards, a [[Chirurgeon]]'s Ensign tends to be a single stark colour with a simple design on it. Many of these banners are blood-red, snow-white, or solid-black with a simple image such as the [[Rune|rune]] of blood, the silhouette of a bird or virtuous animal, or a symbol representative of healing such as a cup or goblet. In some places, especially among the Highborn, these magical standards are called ''Sorrow's Stanchion'' or (much more rarely) ''Memoriam Mortis'' (memories of death). They are sometimes a sign that a regiment or army has suffered a terrible loss at some point in the past, one where many soldiers died. For several decades after their near destruction at the hands of the [[Druj]] during the reign of [[Empress Varkula]], the [[General]] of the [[Granite Pillar]] fought beneath a Chirurgeon's Ensign.
The magical standard is also popular with some [[Freeborn]], who call it ''Death's [[Challenge]]'' and often rally their allies with songs and shouts that mock the foolishness of death and the ability of the living to outwit him or her. More stoic warrior-physicians, especially the [[Grimnir|grimnir]] of [[Wintermark]], also favour these standards - they were common among scops who supported the soldiers of the [[Bloodcloaks]] army before their destruction by the [[Thule]]. The ensign is not universally popular however - it cannot be denied that culturing an awareness of the fragility of life in the [[Banner|banner]] bearer can lead to dangerous levels of empathy for the dying - even for enemies. The urge to wrestle Death that the banner creates in its bearers can lead to them being "distracted" ensuring the fallen on ''both'' sides of a conflict survive - which can be a mixed blessing.
Only those who already have a certain passionate fire can tap into the power of a Chirurgeon's Ensign. It is common for such banner bearers to be equipped with potions such as Skop's Mead that replenish their inner reserves.
