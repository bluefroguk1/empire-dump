### Description
A [[Thaneshall Banner]] is a potent Magical reminder of the history and martial prowess of the people of [[The Empire]]. It usually bears a symbol that represents a historical hero, one who performed great deeds on [[The Battlefield]]. Bleached wool and vibrant dyes are used to create the banner itself, while the [[Weirwood]] banner pole is usually reinforced with green iron and embellished with dragonbone and orichalcum.
The Thaneshall Banner takes its common name from [[Wintermark]], but it is known throughout the Empire.  Among various other nations it might be called a ''dhomiro's flag'', ''exarch's banner'', ''[[Earl]]'s pennant'', ''SteSteward's standard'', ''warlord's banner'', ''wolfshead standard'', ''[[Brand]]'s rally'', ''boyar's banner'', or an ''[[Arbiter]]'s inspiration''. The warrior-standard bearers who carry a Thaneshall Banner into battle often draw on its strength not only to allow them to inSpire their allies, but also to renew their their Fighting spirit or even will to live. Others lead [[The Way]] into the thick of battle wielding their banner in one hand and a weapon in the other - anything from an Apprentice's Blade to a [[Winternight Lifestealer]] may be granted extra potency by the standard's [[Magic]].
One of the most famous examples of this magical standard is surely ''Winter Fury'', the white-stag battle-flag of Queen Ilsin whose army was apparently devoured long ago by Vallornspawn in [[Hercynia]] following a short-lived [[War]] with the pre-Imperial [[Navarr]].
