### Description
A [[Thaneshall Banner]] is a potent magical reminder of the history and martial prowess of the people of the Empire. It usually bears a symbol that represents a historical hero, one who performed great deeds on the battlefield. [[Materials#Beggars Lye|Bleached]] wool and [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|vibrant dyes]] are used to create the banner itself, while the weirwood banner pole is usually reinforced with [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] and embellished with [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]].
The [[Thaneshall Banner]] takes its common name from [[Wintermark]], but it is known throughout the Empire.  Among various other nations it might be called a ''dhomiro's flag'', ''exarch's banner'', ''earl's pennant'', ''steward's standard'', ''warlord's banner'', ''wolfshead standard'', ''brand's rally'', ''boyar's banner'', or an ''arbiter's inspiration''. The warrior-standard bearers who carry a [[Thaneshall Banner]] into battle often draw on its strength not only to allow them to inspire their allies, but also to renew their [[Heroic skills#Get it Together|their fighting spirit]] or even [[Heroic skills#Stay With Me|will to live]]. Others lead the way into the thick of battle wielding their banner in one hand and a weapon in the other - anything from an [[Apprentice's Blade]] to a [[Winternight Lifestealer]] may be granted extra potency by the standard's magic.
One of the most famous examples of this magical standard is surely ''Winter Fury'', the white-stag battle-flag of Queen Ilsin whose army was apparently devoured long ago by vallornspawn in [[Hercynia#Deer's Folly|Hercynia]] following a short-lived war with the pre-Imperial Navarr.
