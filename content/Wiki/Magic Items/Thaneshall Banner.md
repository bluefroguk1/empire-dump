### Description
A [[Thaneshall Banner]] is a potent magical reminder of the [[History|history]] and martial prowess of the people of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. It usually bears a symbol that represents a historical hero, one who performed great deeds on [[The Battlefield|the battlefield]]. Bleached wool and vibrant dyes are used to create the [[Banner|banner]] itself, while the [[Weirwood|weirwood]] banner pole is usually reinforced with [[Green iron|green iron]] and embellished with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] and [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]].
The [[Thaneshall Banner]] takes its common name from [[Wintermark]], but it is known throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]].  Among various other nations it might be called a ''[[Dhomiro|dhomiro]]'s flag'', ''[[Exarch|exarch]]'s banner'', ''[[Earl|earl]]'s pennant'', ''[[Steward|steward]]'s standard'', ''[[Warlord|warlord]]'s banner'', ''wolfshead standard'', ''[[Brand|brand]]'s rally'', ''[[Boyar|boyar]]'s banner'', or an ''[[Arbiter|arbiter]]'s inspiration''. The warrior-standard bearers who carry a [[Thaneshall Banner]] into battle often draw on its strength not only to allow them to inspire their allies, but also to renew their their fighting spirit or even [[Will|will]] to live. Others lead [[The Way|the way]] into the thick of battle wielding their banner in one hand and a weapon in the other - anything from an Apprentice's Blade to a [[Winternight Lifestealer]] may be granted extra potency by the standard's [[Magic|magic]].
One of the most famous examples of this magical standard is surely ''[[Winter]] Fury'', the white-stag battle-flag of Queen Ilsin whose army was apparently devoured long ago by vallornspawn in [[Hercynia]] following a short-lived [[War|war]] with the pre-Imperial [[Navarr]].
