## Description
These items were first crafted in [[Highguard]], and were also popular with both the [[Freeborn]] and the founding cities of [[The League]]. Their usefulness soon saw them spread across all the Imperial nations, and beyond. Travellers suggest that their use is equally common in [[Faraden]] and the [[Principalities of Jarm]].
Unlike many other items of [[Ritual|ritual]] paraphernalia they are usually crafted in the form of an actual chalice, goblet, tankard or bowl of [[Green iron|green iron]] decorated with [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]]. They are usually rich in appearance, and it is common for them to be further ornamented with precious metals and carefully selected precious stones. During [[Rituals|rituals]] an orator's chalice is passed back and forth between the subjects of the ritual and the [[Coven|coven]] using it, symbolically reinforcing the connections between all the [[Groups|groups]] involved. The nature of the ritual defines precisely how it is used but it is common for everyone to share a drink from [[The Chalice|the chalice]] at the beginning ,or during the performance, of the ritual.
The ability to extend the power of a ritual to individuals from two [[Bands|bands]] is subtle but should not be underestimated. These items are often used before [[Battles|battles]] to perform powerful [[Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Splendid Panoply of Knighthood]] or [[Vitality of Rushing Water]] on members of two [[Bands|bands]], or to allow rituals such as [[Streams of Silver]] or [[Fallow Fields and Dried Meat]] on the resources controlled by members of different groups in the same region.
As with the similar Cartographer's Eye, several covens of a mercantile bent make great use of this 'covenstone', but it is probably more popular with magicians like those associated with the [[Rod and Shield]] order of the [[Imperial Conclave]] who specialise in enchanting warriors heading for some battlefield or another.
## Rules
