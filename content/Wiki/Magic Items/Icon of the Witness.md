## Description
These ceremonial tools, in common with several other icons, allow a priest to perform or assist with a [[Liao]] ceremony that they have not personally mastered. The [[Icon of the Witness]] is often decorated with images of exemplars and paragons who have exalted others more than themselves, or whose tales include inspirational moments of [[Judgement|judgement]], revelation and the like. It is common for one of these icons to include themes of measuring or weighing - scales are often used, but so are short staves marked at regular intervals. The [[Paragon|paragon]] [[Zoria]] is said to have crafted the first [[Icon of the Witness]], an artefact in the shape of a three-foot rod marked in inches, although the truth of this claim is difficult to ascertain.
An [[Icon of Judgement|icon of judgement]] requires months of work by a skilled artisan, commonly with a set of tools inlaid with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] used especially for crafting religious items.
