## Description
In parts of [[The League]] a rod of this nature is called an ''Rod of Expeditious Retreat'' or more rarely a ''Lefthand Bastard.'' Both names refer to its use by Magicians who find themselves in trouble, providing an opening through which to flee. The Lefthand Bastard is a reference to a popular combination used by some ambidextrous mountebanks in which the rod is wielded in one hand while a long blade is used in the other. A magician equipped with both can drive one opponent away while delivering a nasty slash with the other hand.
