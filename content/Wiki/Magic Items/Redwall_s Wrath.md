## Description
The Redwall's Wrath is a dangerous weapon when used by a hero of [[Wintermark]]. The schema was recovered during a conjunction through the [[Sentinel Gate]] to rescue Yantl the Storm Runner. Originally known as the ''Linebreaker's Axe'' the weapon was renamed in honour of the fallen Warrior Sven Red Wall, who fell in [[Liathaven]] during the Winter Solstice 384YE, by Kali Keen-Eye who passed the schema to Sulkavaris to be added to Runesmith's Law.
The original schema suggested use of the [[Runes]] of Storms, Might, Battle, and Victory. The inclusion of Redwall's Wrath has seen a stir of enthusiasm amongst the [[Suaq]] who have shown a great deal of interest in what could prove to be a very cunning weapon.
