## Description
The [[Blackwillow Twist]] is a flexible, resilient weapon whose head is usually made of greensteel (an alloy of green iron), and whose haft is treated with [[Ambergelt]]. In the hands of even a relatively green recruit it can render an opponent briefly helpless, allowing the wielder to strike while the enemy is off-guard, or make a swift retreat.
## Rules
One-Handed Spears
* Effect: Once per day you may call STRIKEDOWN with this one-handed spear.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Blackwillow Twist requires eight ingots of green iron and five ingots of ambergelt. It takes one month to make one of these items.
