## Description
The [[Blackwillow Twist]] is a flexible, resilient weapon whose head is usually made of greensteel (an alloy of [[Green iron|green iron]]), and whose haft is treated with [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]]. In the hands of even a relatively green recruit it can render an opponent briefly helpless, allowing the wielder to strike while the enemy is off-guard, or make a swift retreat.
## Rules
One-Handed Spears
* Effect: Once per [[Day|day]] you may call STRIKEDOWN with this one-handed spear.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Blackwillow Twist]] requires eight ingots of green iron and five ingots of [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
