## Description
While it usually takes the form of a small bowl, a [[Sungold Basin]] is just as likely to be a goblet, cup, or urn. During use, a dose of [[Liao]] is poured into the container. When the user stirs the liao with a finger, the [[Magic]] of the bowl heats it and infuses it with power allowing the priest to use their understanding of the [[Dedication]] ceremony in a manner reminiscent of the techniques used to create dreams. Rather than sharing a dream, however, the priest shares a little of their will-to-live with the target, bringing them back from the threshold of the Labyrinth.
The basin is usually metal, made of an orichalcum alloy with dragonbone inlay, or fired dragonbone ceramic [[Painted]] with orichalcum-infused pigments. Commonly the item bears a labyrinth design on the interior, although when crafted by a [[Wintermark]] artisan it will often bear a rune such as [[Rhyv]], [[Lann]], or [[Verys]] instead (or as well).
The Sungold Basin is relatively popular among Highborn priests who accompany champions into dangerous environments, although it also sees some use among those who minister to League Free Companies. It is at its most valuable among people who have easy access to liao, but where chirurgeons are not common.
## Rules
Regalia
* Effect: When you use the Dedication skill on a dying target you may restore them to 1 hit rather than having the normal effect.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Sungold Basin requires five ingots of orichalcum, and five measures of dragonbone. It takes one month to make one of these items.
