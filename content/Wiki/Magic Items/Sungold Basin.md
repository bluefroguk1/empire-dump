Title: Sungold Basin

## Description
While it usually takes the form of a small bowl, a [[Sungold Basin]] is just as likely to be a goblet, cup, or urn. During use, a dose of [[Liao]] is poured into the container. When the user stirs the liao with a finger, the magic of the bowl heats it and infuses it with power allowing the priest to use their understanding of the [[Dedication]] ceremony in a manner reminiscent of the techniques used to create [[Dedication#Dreams|dreams]]. Rather than sharing a dream, however, the priest shares a little of their will-to-live with the target, bringing them back from the threshold of the Labyrinth.
The basin is usually metal, made of an [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]] alloy with dragonbone inlay, or fired [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] ceramic painted with orichalcum-infused pigments. Commonly the item bears a labyrinth design on the interior, although when crafted by a [[Wintermark]] [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]] it will often bear a rune such as [[Rhyv]], [[Lann]], or [[Verys]] instead (or as well).
The [[Sungold Basin]] is relatively popular among [[Highguard|Highborn]] priests who accompany [[Highguard military concerns|champions]] into dangerous environments, although it also sees some use among those who minister to [[The League|League]] [[Free Company|Free Companies]]. It is at its most valuable among people who have easy access to liao, but where [[Surgical skills#chirurgeon|chirurgeons]] are not common.
## Rules
Regalia
* Effect: When you use the [[Dedication]] skill on a [[Combat#Dying|dying]] target you may restore them to 1 hit rather than having the normal effect.
* Materials: Crafting a [[Sungold Basin]] requires five ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], and five measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
