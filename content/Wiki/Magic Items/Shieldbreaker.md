## Description
A [[Shieldbreaker]] is often a one-handed axe, hammer or mace. It is especially favoured by the [[Steinr]], who use it to great effect when fighting the well-armoured orcs that infest the lands to the west of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Many artisans take [[Pride|pride]] in proving the superiority of their craft over that of the [[Barbarians|barbarians]], showing that anything the orcs could create could be broken by their arts.
Swift and lightly armoured skirmishers among the [[Navarr]], Marcher beaters, and Highborn [[Unconquered]] make use of these weapons to even up the odds against shield-bearing opponents and to soften such foes up for their comrades in the main battle-line. Hammers and axes are the most common forms among these [[Groups|groups]], who sometimes call them ''Bullâ€™s Eye Bait'' as skilful use of these weapons [[Will|will]] open up the target for a deadly shot from allied archers.
Runesmiths often inscribe the [[Rune|rune]] [[Verys]], Rune of Might, on a [[Shieldbreaker]]. Although some smiths prefer to use [[Mawrig]], the Rune of Storms, weapons bearing this mark are often considered to draw their wearers into dangerous situations; they are used by the frayed but many others prefer to avoid them. This weapon is popular with many orcs, both the [[Imperial Orcs]] (especially their reavers), and barbarians.
