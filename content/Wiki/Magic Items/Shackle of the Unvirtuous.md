## Description
These rings were first used among the Highborn as a mark of punishment. A priest who had acted in an inappropriate manner might be sentenced to wear one for a time, cut off from their fellows and the ability to wield religious power as a reminder of some unvirtuous act. However, within a few decades, their use had expanded slightly. Ilyes, son of Castor, a scion of a declining patrician [[Family]], took to wearing one of The Rings as a rejection of the priests who condemned his heritage and lifestyle. He soon discovered that [[The Ring]] offered an unexpected benefit; ceremonies designed to read the [[Aura]] failed utterly when used on him. 
Within a few years a subculture of rejectionists calling themselves "the shackled" began to wear the rings openly in criticism of the growing power and influence of the chapters. The [[Highguard]] [[Assembly]] quickly declared the use of the rings to be a heresy, and the movement collapsed. When [[The Empire]] was formed, the Highborn assembly moved that the rings continue to be considered heretical, but to their dismay they failed to have this made a point of law. Several Senators cited concerns of privacy, despite claims that the virtuous had nothing to fear from ceremonies such as [[Testimony]].
Today, wearing a [[Shackle of the Unvirtuous]] (variously called a ''Rejectionist Ring'', a ''Band of Discretion'', or a ''Shadowcrown'') is frowned on by many priests of [[The Way]] who would very much like to see anyone using one declared a heretic. Several wearers have cited the ability the ring offers to ensure a sleep untroubled by bad dreams as their reason for bearing one, while others have more brazenly admitted that they simply do not like the idea of priests peering into their souls (if they have them).
Traditional shackles were big, obvious rings intended to bring shame to the wearer, but modern versions tend to be more discreet. They are often marked on the inside with the [[Diras]], Rune of Secrets, or the more sinister [[Queros]], Rune of Plots.
