## Description
[[The Captain]]'s Mask empowers a ritualist with the ability to confer additional toughness. The mask is often in the shape of a polished steel mask that covers the forehead and cheeks, reminiscent of a helmet, and is often emblazoned with thunderbolts. Another common form, particularly favoured by Dawnish magicians, is a full- or half-face sun mask. 
The mask often incorporates the [[Rune]] of Battle, sometimes openly and sometimes on the inside so that it rests against the brow of the wearer. A martial animal such as a lion, or the bear and the boar popularised as symbols of [[Courage]] by Varushkan [[Storytellers|storytellers]]. Likewise, a [[Wintermark]]-made mask is likely to represent a hawk or falcon - [[Birds|birds]] associated with the virtue of [[Loyalty]]. 
While this  is most often crafted in the form of a mask, it is sometimes created as a brooch or large amulet depicting crossed swords upon a bright shield. A few [[League]] magicians favour an [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] ring. set with a red or amber stone, and engraved on the inside with a martial motto or inspirational phrase from their [[Coven|coven]] oath; such a ring often specifically represents their [[Loyalty|loyalty]] to their coven.
As with all the magical masks, these foci are used to grant additional power to perform [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magic|magic]]. In this case, it enhances [[Splendid Panoply of Knighthood]]; [[Strength of the Bull]]; and [[Crown of Phoenix Fire]]. A lone [[Summer]] ritualist can use the power of the mask along with the Imperial [[Regio|regio]] to enchant their allies without the aid of a coven, while a committed band of magicians might use the mask to help them enchant large numbers of warriors with a single performance. 
While the mask is useful, there are rumours of a much more potent version whose use allows additional warriors to be [[Enchanted|enchanted]] with a single ritual. If such a mask exists, the secrets of its construction are not common knowledge.
