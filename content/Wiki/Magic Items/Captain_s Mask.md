## Description
The Captain's Mask empowers a ritualist with the ability to confer additional toughness. The mask is often in the shape of a polished steel mask that covers the forehead and cheeks, reminiscent of a helmet, and is often emblazoned with thunderbolts. Another common form, particularly favoured by [[Dawn|Dawnish]] magicians, is a full- or half-face sun mask. 
The mask often incorporates the [[Jotra|Rune of Battle]], sometimes openly and sometimes on the inside so that it rests against the brow of the wearer. A martial animal such as a lion, or the [[Varushka Religious Beliefs#The Virtuous Animals|bear and the boar]] popularised as symbols of [[Courage]] by [[Varushka|Varushkan]] [[Varushka religious beliefs#Storytellers|storytellers]]. Likewise, a [[Wintermark]]-made mask is likely to represent a [[Wintermark culture and customs#Birds and feathers|hawk or falcon]] - birds associated with the virtue of [[Loyalty]]. 
While this  is most often crafted in the form of a mask, it is sometimes created as a brooch or large amulet depicting crossed swords upon a bright shield. A few [[The League|League]] magicians favour an orichalcum ring. set with a red or amber stone, and engraved on the inside with a martial motto or inspirational phrase from their [[Bands#Covens|coven]] oath; such a ring often [[Rings in the League|specifically represents]] their loyalty to their coven.
As with all the magical masks, these [[:Category:Foci|foci]] are used to grant additional power to perform [[Rituals|ritual]] magic. In this case, it enhances [[Splendid Panoply of Knighthood]]; [[Strength of the Bull]]; and [[Crown of Phoenix Fire]]. A lone Summer ritualist can use the power of the mask along with the [[Regio#The Imperial Regio|Imperial regio]] to [[Enchantment|enchant]] their allies without the aid of a coven, while a committed band of magicians might use the mask to help them enchant large numbers of warriors with a single performance. 
While the mask is useful, there are rumours of a much more potent version whose use allows additional warriors to be enchanted with a single ritual. If such a mask exists, the secrets of its construction are not common knowledge.
