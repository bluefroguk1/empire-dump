## Description
The ''[[Icon of the Proud]]'' is, paradoxically, rarely actually called an Icon of the Proud. Rather, every bearer tends to refer to it by a name that has personal meaning for themselves and their people. In [[Dawn]], unsurprisingly, it is an ''Icon of the Glorious''. In [[Wintermark]] an ''Icon of the Hero''; in [[Urizen]] an ''Icon of Excellence'', in [[The Brass Coast]] an ''Icon of Glass''. It might be an ''Icon of the Resolute'' or ''Faithful'', an ''Icon of Sacrifice'', or an ''Icon of the Calloused Hand''. And these are just the common names that reflect [[Pride]] in a nation, rather than the myriad other names that represent more personal pride.
It Generally takes the form of a piece of religious art, usually depicting a paragon or exemplar of Pride such as Richilde. Usually, the iMage is of a figure that the bearer personally finds inspiring and this may mean that it contains the likeness of someone who is not ''technically'' a paragon or exemplar. Some League priests bear a particular ''Icon of the Clever'' that bears the image of [[Emperor Giovanni]] for example, inSpired by his practical politics. The Icon is not always a portrait either - even more so that other icons it is common for an Icon of the Proud to take the form of a piece of art particular to a given nation. In [[Varushka]] for example, it often takes the form of a statuette of an eagle, and is known as a ''Proud Eagle'' or occasionally (and a little paradoxically) a ''Wise Eagle''.
The icon is equally valuable to a priest who is dedicated to one of the other six virtues as it is to a priest who is dedicated to none of them. It allows them to perform ceremonies such as [[Anointing]], [[Consecration]], and [[Hallow]], and create [[Auras of Pride]] in place of the auras they would otherwise have access to. It also allows a priest to cooperate with priests dedicated to Pride who are not part of their sect.
