## Description
Modelled after the habits favoured by the monks and friars of [[The Marches]], the Keeper's Habit most often takes the form of a wide-sleeved, hooded robe. Generally simple in design, they are nonetheless woven from delicate lambs' wool and beautifully decorated with [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]], [[Green iron|green iron]] and [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]]. These decorations often take the for of symbols assocaited with the virtues of [[Loyalty]], [[Pride]], and [[Prosperity]].
The vestment empowers the priest who wears it to strengthen their allies, inspiring them to keep fighting regardless of the odds against them. The healing power it provides relies on the ability of a properly trained priest to briefly connect their own spirit to the spirit of their injured companion.
As with many item intended for use by a priest, these vestments are often hallowed. Common choices include Hallowing of the [[Cicisbeo]], Hallowing of [[The Little Mother|the Little Mother]], or the Hallowing of the [[Steward]].
