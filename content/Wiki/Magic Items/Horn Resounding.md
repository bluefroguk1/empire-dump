## Description
[[A Horn Resounding]] allows a priest to use a musical performance to draw on the power of the [[Consecration|consecration]] of [[Pride]] to inspire their audience. Listeners are filled with a profound sense of self-esteem, their inner strength revitalised and empowered to face the challenges that are to come. The power of the magical musical instrument itself is only part of the process that brings about this spiritual experience - the performance itself helps connect the spirit of the audience with the power of the potent consecrated [[Aura|aura]]. 
These items often take the form of a brass instrument - horns or trumpet especially - although any musical instrument is appropriate. The metal used to create them is infused with [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and polished with [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] decorations or keys. A more traditional artisan may make the instrument from the horn of a mighty beast, inlaid with dragonbone and with an orichalcum mouthpiece. In [[Wintermark]], [[Pride]] is represented by [[Feresh]], and this [[Rune|rune]] is often worked into the decoration of the instrument.
The loud, resounding tones a musician coaxes from these powerful instruments stirs the heart of the audience, filling them with [[Pride|pride]] and confidence. Often, a priest [[Will|will]] intersperse their performance with short readings or recitations of poetry specifically chosen to inspire their audience - tales of [[Paragons and Exemplars]] are common but as an instrument of [[Pride]] it is just as effective to evoke the names of cultural [[Heroes|heroes]] and the work of beloved poets. A [[Horn Resounding]] is often employed by soldiers to greet the [[Dawn|dawn]] and the dusk, and to sound the mournful dirge at a warrior's funeral. In [[Wintermark]] and [[Highguard]] particularly there is a belief that notes played on this instrument at twilight are audible to the dead; a reminder of what they gave their lives for and an assurance that their deeds are never forgotten.
As with many religious [[Magic Items]], it is common for [[A Horn Resounding|a Horn Resounding]] to be hallowed. A popular choice is the Hallowing of [[Lepidus]], which inspires the bearer to inspire others, or the Hallowing of Richilde which inspires the bearer to strive to create beautiful [[Music|music]].
