## Description
This valuable item is usually crafted in the form of an orb of crystal, glass, metal inlaid with tempest jade. It is infused with potent Enchantments and attuned to the [[Realm]] of Day. A coven can use it to draw on the power contained in ingots of weltsilver and align it with their own [[Magic]], allowing them to reduce or in some cases replace the need for crystal mana when performing [[Day rituals]].
A [[Radiant Orb]] is almost always highly polished to maintain a reflective surface. It might be crafted as a bowl or mirror, a brazier, or a censer used to burn perfumed herbs during Rituals. The item is often marked with [[Runes]]; or with iMages associated with divination, such as eyes or flames. Regardless of the precise form it takes, a coven that uses it is careful to ensure that it takes [[Pride]] of place in their ceremonies - in addition to its magical functions it is a potent reminder of their unity of purpose and their coven oath. In some cases the Radiant Orb is kept surrounded by candles, so that it is never in darkness. Some Highborn covens keep the orb immersed in fresh water when it is not in use, helping to ensure that it remains 'pure', and ensure that it is carefUlly washed after every use.
## Rules
Paraphernalia
* Effect: Members of the coven who are performing a Day ritual they have mastered may use weltsilver in place of crystal mana. Every two measures of weltsilver spent count as one crystal mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Radiant Orb requires seven ingots of tempest jade, four ingots of weltsilver and three measures of dragonbone. It takes one month to make one of these items.
