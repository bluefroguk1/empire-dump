Title: Bondring

## Description
Sometimes called a ''Dragonbone Ring'', a [[Bondring]] is a piece of magical jewellery favoured by anyone who links their life to that of another. They are used extensively by [[The League|League]] [[The League culture and customs#Relationships|cicisbeo]], by trusted [[Dawn|Dawnish]] [[Retainer|retainers]], by bodyguards across the Empire, and by sworn comrades-in-arms and battle partners from all nations. They are also a popular gift between lovers, and it is not uncommon for a wedding to include an exchange of Bondrings and the ceremonial [[Create Bond|bonding]] of the partners together. 
The magic of the [[Bondring]] works through the power of the bond. It allows the wearer to offer aid and succour to their partner - the person they are bonded to. In some cases, two such wearers are bound together with mutual bonds but this is not a requirement (for example, while a bodyguard or cicisbeo is likely to be bonded to a patron or client, the reverse is rarely the case). While a [[Bondring]] does not offer dramatic healing power, it cannot be denied that these talismans save lives across the Empire every year. 
A Bondring is almost always a ring, or less commonly a bracer, either made from dragonbone or decorated with dragonbone inlays. They are frequently decorated with symbols of love, commitment or [[Loyalty]] (such as hounds, hawks or falcons); runes such as [[Zorech]], or [[Lann]]; or stones that evoke the image of [[The Three Sisters]] or [[The Chain]].
## Rules
Jewellery
* Effect: This item allows the [[Create Bond]] spell to be cast to connect you to a single willing target; you can be bonded to only one person at a time, and if you stop being bonded to the bond ring, this additional bond breaks. Once per day you may use either [[Heroic skills#Stay With Me|stay with me]] or [[Heroic skills#Get it Together|get it together]] on the other person that you have bonded the ring to, without spending a [[Heroic skills#Hero points|hero point]].
* Materials: Crafting a Bondring requires seven measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
