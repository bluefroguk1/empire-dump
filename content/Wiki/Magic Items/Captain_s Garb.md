## Description
[[The Captain]]'s Garb is a suit of magical clothing with a distinctly martial look, infused with a little of the power of the dramaturgical persona of [[The Captain]]. A [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magician|magician]] who wears this clothing can draw on the power it contains to [[Empower|empower]] their ability to perform [[Summer magic]]. In addition to providing additional magical power, the robes also infuse the wearer with some of the personality of [[The Captain|the Captain]].
As a garment infused with the essence of [[The Captain|the Captain]], the robe also empowers the wearer's awareness of their own heroic qualities, helping them to stand firm and giving a gentle reminder of what is important â€“ their friends.
The raiment itself is generally woven from wool, carefully bleached and dyed with vibrant colours, and decorated with sungold embroidery. They invariably include an amount of both soft leather and [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]] incorporated into the embellishments or used to provide additional shape for the [[Costume|costume]]. The clothes tend to have a martial cut, designed to allow the wearer to move freely, reflecting the role of [[The Captain|the Captain]] as a figure who takes action. The Captain's Raiment tends to reflect the fashions of [[The League]] and [[Dawn]], but designs also exist for an even more practical outfit employing Marcher style, dubbed the ''[[Mummer]]'s Yeoman'', and a version cut to fit the aesthetics of a wealthy [[Steinr]] dubbed the ''Hero's Tunic''.
While the Captain's Garb provides no protection in itself, it is an easy matter for the [[Costume|costume]] to be created with an eye to being worn under a suit of [[Mage|mage]] armour, leaving space to integrate pauldrons, pectoral, belt, circlet, vambraces, gorget, or greaves. In this way, a magician who also fights the enemies of [[The Empire|the Empire]] with rod or staff can continue to draw on the power of the Captain infused into the robe.
