## Description
[[The Bishop]]'s Ensemble is a suit of magical clothing infused with a little of the power of the dramaturgical persona of The [[Bishop]]. A [[Ritual|ritual]] [[Magician|magician]] who wears this clothing can draw on the power it contains to [[Empower|empower]] their ability to perform [[Day magic]]. In addition to providing additional magical power, the robes also infuse the wearer with some of the personality of [[The Bishop|the Bishop]].
As [[The Prince]] represents temporal power, so the [[Bishop]] represents the power of the spiritual [[Realms|realms]]. The dramaturgical persona represents questions of morality and ethics, and of the motivations that move people of all kinds. [[The Bishop]] possesses keen [[Insight|insight]] and unassailable [[Judgement|judgement]], and this magical garment is infused with a little of that ethereal potence. In addition, the power woven into the threads of the [[Bishop]]'s Ensemble strengthens and extends the critical faculties of the wearer, supporting their ability – and [[Will|will]] – to offer profound advice to those who need it. A magician girded in the guise of [[The Bishop|the Bishop]] [[Will|will]] rarely falter in the pursuit of what they know to be right.
A trained ritual magician bonded to the robe can touch the essence of the [[Bishop]] and draw on additional strength when working [[Day]] [[Magic|magic]]. With the [[Insight|insight]] and discernment of the persona enhancing and supporting their own, they can weave much more potent effects either by themselves or as part of a [[Coven|coven]].
The garment itself tends to suggest both authority and spirituality. The cloth – woven from fine linen and wool – is repeatedly bleached in vats of beggar's lye until even the tiniest impurity is removed. Moonsilver and sungold threads are used to embroider the outer robe with symbols of spiritual power – often the Labyrinth, the wheel, or iconography of the seven Virtues (especially [[Wisdom]] and [[Vigilance]]).
While the standard design is clearly patterned after the vestments of the [[Bishops|bishops]] of [[Tassato]] and [[Sarvos]], the decorations are carefully chosen to represent the spiritual symbols of the wearer. For example, a [[Bishop]]'s Ensemble crafted for a Varushkan magician might replace the common iconography with images of the virtuous animals, and substitute a striking crimson cloth for the under-robe. Likewise, a robe woven for an [[Urizen]] magician might eschew the [[Symbols of the Way|symbols of the Way]] in favour of designs reflecting the imagery of the sun and moon, or an intricate web of seed pearls and [[Weltsilver|weltsilver]] thread.
House Bourné produces a popular alternate design they have dubbed the ''[[Seer]]'s Ensemble''. It abandons the more usual gold-and-white colour scheme in favour of a deep blue cloth patterned with curving weltsilver lines reminiscent of sunlight on water – a design that has obvious Asavean influences and has allegedly proved quite popular in [[The Brass Coast]].
