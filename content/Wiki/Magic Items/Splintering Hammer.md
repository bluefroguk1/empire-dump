## Description
Usually taking the form of a massive two-handed warhammer, maul, or club the [[Splintering Hammer]] allows a warrior to smash the weapon or armour of their opponent. Less versatile than a Woodcutter's Axe, the hammer allows only one powerful blow each [[Day|day]] but nonetheless proves quite popular with many Imperial soldiers. In particular, it is sometimes carried as a "back up" weapon by weapon masters who favour a different fighting style - allowing them to shift to the two-handed hammer when they need a little extra might to devastate a particularly stubborn opponent.
These weapons are popular in [[Dawn]] and among the [[Imperial Orcs]]. A heavy hammer or great mace, studded with [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] and inlaid with [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and [[Green iron|green iron]], swung with a forceful two-handed blow can sometimes cause a poorly made [[Barbarian|barbarian]] shield to literally explode into wooden splinters. Denied their protection, the follow-up swing from a skilled warrior leaves the enemy crippled or bleeding out with shattered ribcage and pulverised internal organs. Knights who favour these potent weapons have a perhaps not undeserved reputation for brutality - especially if they choose to use a [[Splintering Hammer|splintering hammer]] in a duel or tournament. By contrast, that very reputation for brutal, straightforward practicality that first disarms and then destroys an opponent makes them quite popular with the Orcs (and with more than a few who carry the [[Briar]] [[Lineage]]).
## Rules
