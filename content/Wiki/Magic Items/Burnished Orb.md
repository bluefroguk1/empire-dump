## Description
Few [[Ritual|ritual]] tools are as splendid as those associated with the practice of [[Summer magic]]. This valuable item is usually crafted in the form of a metal orb inlaid with [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] and usually decorated with gold, silver and precious gems. It is infused with potent enchantments and attuned to the [[Realm|realm]] of [[Summer]]. A [[Coven|coven]] can use it to draw on the power contained in ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]] and align it with their own [[Magic|magic]], allowing them to reduce or in some cases replace the need for crystal mana when performing Summer [[Rituals|rituals]].
A [[Burnished Orb]] most often takes the form of an actual 'covenstone' wielded by one of the magicians in a ritual, but it is not the only shape appropriate to this item. Some covens possess burnished orbs that take the form of a bowl or chalice, while others possess a literal crown that is worn by one of the ritualists to display the aspects of majesty and potence that are core to many [[Summer rituals]]. The item is often marked with [[Runes|runes]]; or with images associated with power and strength such as physically strong animals (stags and eagles being the most common); clenched fists; castles; or the accoutrements of [[War|war]]. Regardless of the precise form it takes, a coven that uses it is careful to ensure that it plays a central role in their ceremonies - in addition to its ceremonial use it is a symbol of their unity of purpose and their coven oath.
## Rules
Paraphernalia
* Effect: Members of the coven who are performing a [[Summer ritual]] they have mastered may use orichalcum in place of crystal mana. Every two measures of orichalcum spent count as one crystal mana.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Burnished Orb]] requires seven ingots of tempest jade, four ingots of orichalcum and three measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
