## Description
The [[Straw Mask]] Empowers the wearer to perform [[Rituals]] that vastly increase the output of their lands. It is often constructed using lacquered corn-ears, strung together to cover the face and interlaced with fine knotwork of metallic threads. It is rare for these talismans not to incorporate at least one [[Bravash]], the Rune of Fertility, either in place of one of the eyes or (especially outside [[Wintermark]]), on the inside of the mask so that it touches the forehead, cheeks or chin when the mask is worn. Regardless of the precise design, even in [[The League]] it is usually constructed out of natural material such as wood. Some traditions of dramaturgists (especially mummers) prefer to personify the mask as a beast - usually a goat, sheep or bUll - incorporating it into bawdy ritual plays involving more than a little suggestive dialogue.
Some [[Navarr]] and Varushkan artisans create this item in the form of a ''Crown of Thorns and Ivy'' - a circlet of interwoven strands of the titular material, sometimes bound together with threads of gold and silver, with carefully preserved berries or small flowers. At the end of a year, the crowns are ceremonially burnt or buried, or abandoned near a funeral glade.
As with all the Magical masks, these foci are used to grant additional power to perform ritual [[Magic]]. In this case, it enhances a suite of rituals that enchant Farms to ensure an excellent harvest. By itself, it will allow even a novice of Spring or [[Winter magic]] to perform [[Blessing of New Spring]] or [[Fallow Fields and Dried Meat]] without having mastered them, and without the [[Assistance]] of a coven.
Likewise, the mask may help an adept of Summer lore perform the [[Strong Ox, Golden Sun]] ritual by themselves, or contribute toWards the power of a coven attempting to enchant multiple farms. A true Autumn master could use the mask along with the Imperial [[Regio]] and the power of a [[Melancholic Staff]] to achieve a personal performance of the complex [[Gathering the Harvest]] ritual, should they be so inclined. A single mask rarely makes a significant difference with the latter ritual, but each additional rank of lore can prove useful - especially when performing the ritual on multiple farms at once. It can also prove useful for a mixed coven - by providing an advantage in three connected rituals from three separate realms of magic it can help a coven member who is less well-trained in some of the lores to contribute more fully to a group performance, especially if they have mastered the ritual.
The mask is most versatile in the hands of a ritualist who has trained in all four of the lores it uses - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter - but some covens simply pass these masks back and forth between their members over the course of a year as different rituals are required in different seasons. Some examples of these masks in [[The Marches]] and [[Dawn]] are said to have been passed around in this fashion since before the first Dawnish boots touched the soil of the [[Bay of Catazar]], and are treated with special reverence.
