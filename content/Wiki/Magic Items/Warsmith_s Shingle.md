### Description
This Magical standard takes its name from the famous "banner" carried by Vasilisa the Prosperous, a Varushkan hero who was said to possess supernatural ability to [[Mend]] and repair anything - from Shattered spears and shields to broken hearts and sundered friendships. She is often depicted in Varushkan art with her "banner" - the wooden sign of a smith's force hanging from a simple yet sturdy pole. Today, the Warsmith's Shingle is much more likely to take the form of a strong canvas flag, banner, or pennant; but it is likely to be decorated with symbols of craftsmanship, industry, and [[Prosperity]] (such as Anvils, hammers, and bees) either on the pole or worked into the edges of the main banner.
A Warsmith's Shingle is usually woven with threads of orichalcum, both the banner and its pole will be reinforced with [[Ambergelt]] solution that makes them hard-wearing and prEvents fading and accidental daMage. Members Of The Warrior band know to look for the standard on [[The Battlefield]] if their weapon or shield is damaged, confident that they will be able to get it repaired. Banner-bearers who wield a Warsmith's Shingle consequently tend to further enhance their ability to repair splintered weapons and shields by further investing in items such as a [[Redsteel Chisel]], [[Forge of Isenbrad]], or phials of Artisan's Oil.
The standard is popular with many nations - especially those that favour pole-arms (such as Marchers) or heavy shields (such as [[Dawn]], the [[Imperial Orcs]], and the Highborn) - simply for its ability to repair damaged weapons and shields. Some nations, however, look for more subtle benefits in a Warsmith's Shingle. In the citadels of [[Urizen]] for example it is sometimes called a ''[[Sentinel]]'s Compass'' and they value it as much for [[The Way]] it enCourages the bearer to look for opportunities to intervene in places where the unit can make the most difference. A contingent of sentinels under this banner will quickly identify places where the battleplan is going awry, and take steps to "resolve" that situation.
