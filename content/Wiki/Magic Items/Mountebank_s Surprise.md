## Description
A wand and a one-handed sword are a common combination for a [[The League magical traditions|mountebank]] in [[The League|the League]]. This particular pair of enchantments are favoured by those who specialise in two person confidence tricks. When both of the swindlers are armed with these, they can often take on a surprising number of angry marks by [[Empower|empowering]] each other. A particularly notorious [[The League territories#Tassato Mestra and Tassato Regario|Tassatan]] pair named Tullio and Miguelito were known to employ such tactics in the latter part of their career, most notably to escape the guards of the de Guerra [[Guilds|Carta]] after conning their [[The League leadership|Merchant Prince]] out of his signet [[The League hearth magic#Rings|ring]], a tale immortalised in the popular opera ''The Golden Trod''.
In [[Dawn]], these items are known as ''Mirrors of Glory'', for by strengthening an ally, the [[Dawn magical traditions|war witch]] is also strengthened. Those among the [[Navarr]] who have taken the oaths of both the [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|vate]] and the [[Thorn]] sometimes wield these in the form of a [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] axe and a stout [[Materials#Dragonbone|worldmarrow]] rod, calling them ''Star-Sworn Legacies'' in remembrance of [[Navarr magical traditions|Star]], one of the first vates, who provided Navarr and Thorn with magical aid in their battles against the [[Vallorn]]. A number of Navarr [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]] make this items only at night, under visible stars, while reciting the [[Navarr Culture and Customs#vows|oaths]] of vates, thorns and [[Brands]] to teach the two items to support each other and to assist their wielder in aiding others. 
In the League, both items often bear [[Lann]], the [[Runes|rune]] of bargains, representing the benefit of the spell to both parties, while Dawnish versions use the [[Runes#Runes of Summer|Gryphon runes]], placing [[Feresh]] and [[Verys]] on the rod and [[Jotra]] and [[Tykonus]] on the blade.
## Rules

The tavern-master sighed, and went back to his glasses. 
"...and then I said.... 'That old saw? Your thumb? Ambition's balls, that was old when Richilde first called for minstrels! Is that your best?', and her friend hissed  'And who are you to say?' and I say 'Why, nothing but a street rat, oh king of cats!', and she spits 'A rat indeed, by the state of your doublet! And what do you want of me?' and so ''I'' said 'One of your nine lives; and if that goes well, I'll have the other eight...'"
The ragged man winced to an ill-judged movement. He kept his left arm close to his body, tied up in a makeshift sling.
"Oh, I forget what else. It was witty, though. Of course, then they came for me, the pair of them. Now, I clocked the one of them tap the other with their wand, and so I was ready for her to be good with her blade, and I caught it on my guard, but I wasn't expected the other to come through so hard and so damned fast! They only had a wand out: but no, they drew a blade, and caught me under the standard, right in the pit. Over I went, then it was down to boots in the gutter... Near the church-door by the well, you know it?" 
He coughed, into a blood-stained handkerchief.
"Everyone's a critic, aren't they? Now, do you have a spot of Anodyne Analgesic to go with this wine...?"
