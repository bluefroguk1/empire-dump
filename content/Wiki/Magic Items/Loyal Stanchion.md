### Description
Usually hanging from a stout oaken shaft, a [[Loyal Stanchion]] allows the banner bearer to renew the Fighting spirit of their allies and stave off death for another day. They are particularly popular among both the yeomen of Marcher Households the cataphracts of [[Highguard]], and the Warriors of the [[Imperial Orcs]] for their ability to allow a soldier in fUll harness to provide much needed Healing and support to their allies. The banners themselves are usually woven of sturdy wool strengthened with beggars lye and [[Ambergelt]], with a straightforward sigil enhanced with vibrant dyes. The Oaken banner pole will be reinforced with green iron and ambergelt varnish, and decorated with dragonbone embellishments.
The banner bearer can draw on the standard to keep their allies on their feet. There have been several notable Loyal Stanchions in [[Imperial history]] - for example, during the reign of [[Empress Teleri]] the Marcher [[Assembly]] gifted the [[Cardinal of Loyalty]] an artefact standard Hallowed with true [[Liao]]. Named ''Duty'', for over a century the [[Cardinal]] would bestow custodianship of the standard on a banner possessed of exemplary integrity and [[Loyalty]]. Unfortunately, Duty is believed to now lie at the bottom of the [[Bay of Catazar]], lost along with the then-Cardinal Jocelyn Rosewood when the Barabbine [[Fleet]] was destroyed.
Several armies have made good use of Loyal Stanchions. Both the heavily armoured [[Golden Sun]] of [[Dawn]], and the adaptable [[Golden Axe]] of [[Varushka]] have been known to equip core contingents with these banners, for example, but they are also popular with the [[Jotun]] and Imperial orcs. As with many such regimental standards, the Magical stanchions are reforged over and over, with each successive artisan adding a new embellishment, or replacing an element that has worn out. These Loyal Stanchions technically contain no element of the original banners at all - but nobody who has ever borne one into battle is left in any doubt as to the power that courses through them, reinforced by decades or centuries of holding the spirit Of The Warrior band.
Bearers of a Loyal Stanchion, particularly one that has been reforged multiple times, often hear a supportive voice encouraging them. This voice is especially strong when they are afraid, or uncertain. Many bearers report that the voice reminds them of that of a trusted [[Family]] member or close friend, especially one that is long departed. Others believe that the voice is that of the banner itself - that its [[Magic]] somehow senses when the bearer is faltering and needs a word of support or validation. A few Imperial Orcs have claimed that the Loyal Stanchion talks to them in the voice of an ancestor, although it is not clear whether this is down to the standard or the Imperial Orcs themselves.
