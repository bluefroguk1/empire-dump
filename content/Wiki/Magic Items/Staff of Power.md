## Description
While a [[Staff of Power]] is sometimes disparaged but offers a straightforWard reserve of additional power to any magician. As the [[Hakima]] Zacarias i [[Guerra]] said during an argument with Tiberius of SunSpire, "For the price of one of your staffs, magus, I can give a staff of power to both my brothers, and still have enough left over for a stormcudgel with which to beat you." For this reason they are more Generally found amongst those people who value [[Magic]] less than martial prowess.
A staff of power often bears the six Dawnish symbols of the Realms, worked in with orichalcum or carved along its length. Alternatively, the haft itself may have the form of a hexagonal prism (with rounded grips for the hands, of course), or a hexagonal weight at the casting end. A staff with this form, whether carved with the [[Realm]]-[[Runes]] or not, is known as a Staff of the Six Realms, after a very ancient example which actually predates the development of the [[Staff of the Magi]], and which therefore represents the pinnacle of achievement in this field in its day. The original Staff of the Six Realms is long-since lost, disappearing in the shipwreck that killed its owner, Polonius of Coppermount [[Spire]], in the [[Bay of Catazar]] in the second century B.E.
