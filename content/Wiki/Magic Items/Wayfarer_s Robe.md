## Description
This sturdy garment is often made of soft wool treated with beggar's lye and dyed in rich colours. The robe is decorated with [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]], and often bears beautiful embroidery. It often bears a hood, and is commonly designed to be worn over other clothing - or even armour on some occasions. It is favoured by priests who serve as spiritual advisors, especially to military units, and in some places it is called a ''Warpriest's Robe''. The robe can also prove valuable to itinerant or missionary priests who regularly find themselves in situations where there are no other priests of [[The Way|the Way]] nearby. This has led to the item being dubbed a ''missionary robe'' or a ''mendicant's coat'' in various parts of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
The potential strength it offers to a priest's ceremonies which makes it appealing to active, adventurous priests such as a [[Troubadour]] who supports a band of questing knights or a Varushkan priest who investigates spiritual corruption alongside a [[Warden|warden]] fellowship. Such adventurous priests never know when they might encounter a malign [[Aura]] that must be removed, or the influence of a malignant spirit that must be exorcised. Being able to strengthen the potence of a ceremony can make the difference between success and tragic failure.
Also known as a ''Pilgrim's Robe'', this vestment was traditionally called a ''[[Wayfarer]]'s Chasuble''. A chasuble was a pilgrim's garment popular among pre-Imperial Highborn priests. This took the form of a circle or oval of cloth, a little like a poncho, with a hole in the middle for the head, falling  on all sides nearly to the ground and gathered up to allow the arms to be used freely. Often made of tough wool, sometimes treated with [[Ambergelt|ambergelt]] to make it waterproof. Its association with pilgrimages and thus itinerant [[Preachers|preachers]] led to it being further associated with several early [[Chapters]]. The popularity of the chasuble grew as [[The Way|the Way]] spread, but over time it fell out of fashion. Today the use of the chasuble has been largely replaced by the use of robes.
As with many [[Magic Items|magic items]] of a ceremonial nature, it is common for a Wayfarer's Robe to be hallowed, even where it is intended to be worn by an undedicated priest of the Way (rather than a member of a specific virtue [[Assembly|assembly]]). Common hallows include the Hallowing of [[Inga Tarn]], the Hallowing of the [[Archivist]] or Scout, or the Hallowing of the [[Volhov]].
