## Description
These ceremonial tools, in common with several other [[:Category:Icons|icons]], allow a priest to perform or assist with a [[Liao]] ceremony that they have not personally mastered. The [[Icon of the Judge]], or ''Icon of Judgement'', is the rarest of its kind. They are often crafted from thin rods or even short staffs, or from a bundle of thin rods bound together with bands of precious metal. This last form is a metaphor for the idea that a single stick can be broken, but several sticks bound together are almost impossible to snap. Given the uses to which this item, and the ceremony it provides, are commonly put the bundle's symbolism is especially apt.
An [[Icon of the Judge]] requires months of work by a skilled [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisan]], commonly with a set of tools inlaid with [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]] used especially for crafting religious items. The materials used are usually carefully purified, and in [[The Marches]] in particular a crafter will not embark on creating one of these icons without first being [[The Marches culture and customs#shriving|shriven]] by a trusted priest. Unlike most other icons, an [[Icon of the Judge]] is rarely ornamented. They are serious items with a very serious purpose.
