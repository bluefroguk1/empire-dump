## Description

It is common for them to be granted by Dawnish knightly orders to a new member who has just passed their Test of Mettle. When given in such a way they are traditionally decorated with the heraldic symbols of the knight errant’s new order.
They also have some popularity in [[The Marches|the Marches]] where yeomen with a sense of irony [[Commission|commission]] great [[Green iron|green iron]] poleaxes called ''[[Dawn]]’s [[Folly]]''.

Lord Bohemond held out the great two-handed sword towards Annice.
“Annice, have you been to all nations Imperial and saved the life of one citizen of each in turn as was your Test of Mettle?”
“That I have, sir” she replied solemnly
“Then  arise, Lady Annice.Take this blade as a sign of membership of the Order of the [[Spring]] Colt”
Lady Annice rose from her knee, plate clinking into position. She turned to face the rising sun. A cloud of dust had risen over the lip of the hill. 
She held the new sword aloft and smiled, the weltsilver [[Horse|horse]]’s head glistened in the light.
The assembled host cheered and roared, louder even than the approaching [[Barbarian|barbarian]] mass.
Lady Annice stepped forward against the orc charge. The crude battleline broke like a wave upon the cliffs.
