## Description
A [[Chrysalis Pendant]] is often crafted of blue crystal or decorated with deep azure stones especially lapis lazuli. It commonly takes the form if a butterfly, or a hanging cone reminiscent of a cocoon. It is primarily of use to banner-bearers, bards, and leaders who use their strength of personality and willpower to ensure the good Health of their companions. With a few moments of confident attention, the wearer can slip dislocated limbs back into position, numb the pain of a shocking blow, or otherwise help their companions overcome the daMage inflicted to an arm or a leg.
## Rules
Jewellery
* Effect:  You may spend a hero point and engage in five seconds of appropriate roleplay to restore the use of a limb that has been Ruined by the cleave or impale call. The roleplaying must include manipulating the ruined limb. If you or your target attacks another character or either of you are hit then the attempt to use this ability fails. The hero point is not lost but you must begin the roleplaying again.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a chrysalis pendant requires eight ingots of weltsilver, five measures of [[Ambergelt]] and three measures of beggar's lye. It takes one month to make one of these items.
