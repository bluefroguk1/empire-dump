## Description
A Cartographer's Eye may take a number of forms; a sphere of glass or crystal, often contained within [[Bands]] of metal; a set of actual map-maker's tools; or a beautifUlly inlaid and detailed map are all common forms. The item is usually set with tempest jade and often has precise measurements laid out in weltsilver around the edges to help focus the minds of the Magicians who use it on the wider geographical scale.
The first Cartographer's Eyes were used by Marcher Landskeepers to extend the influence of Rituals such as [[Blessing of New Spring]], [[Strong Ox, Golden Sun]] and [[Gathering the Harvest]]. They were quickly adopted by magicians in other nations, however, especially in [[Varushka]], [[The Brass Coast]] and the [[The League]]. The ability to extend the power of rituals to cover far-flung businesses and Farms is especially valuable to magicians of those nations. While the similar Orator's Chalice is commonly used for the benefit of Warriors and armies, the Cartographer's Eye is ''much'' more valuable to economically minded magicians; they are rarely shy about charging for the added versatility that comes from its use. Some magicians lament the fact that there seems to be no way to combine the power of the Cartographer's Eye with that of the Orator's Chalice; the coven must always choose between using their rituals on members of two bands, or on targets in two Regions, never having both options.
It should be noted that while this is a powerful tool, it is useless when combined with rituals that effect entire regions or territories; it cannot be used to enchant or [[Curse]] two regions or two territories. The restriction is subtle, and often hard to explain to non-magicians, but it boils down to the fact that it only affects rituals that affect a distinct range of targets within a geographical region by extending the area within which those targets may be selected.
## Rules
Paraphernalia
* Effect: When your coven performs a ritual that targets resources in a single territory, they can also include resources from a second territory provided both are part of the same nation.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a Cartographer's Eye requires seven ingots of tempest jade, five ingots of weltsilver, and four measures of dragonbone. It takes one month to make one of these items.
