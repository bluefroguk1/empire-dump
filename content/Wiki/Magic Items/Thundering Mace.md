## Description
These weapons strike with incredible force. The [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]] inlaid into the head and handle enhance the weapon's momentum and hurl the enemy to the ground - sometimes literally lifting them off the ground with the power of the blow before bringing them crashing back [[Down to Earth|down to earth]], prone and vulnerable. Many foes are unprepared for the mighty blow this weapon can strike, and the moment of fear and [[Confusion|confusion]] coupled with their disadvantageous position makes them easy prey for any follow-up strikes.
Several [[Magistrates|magistrates]] are known to maintain a small stock of these weapons, issued to trusted adjutants and investigators for the express purpose of preventing suspected criminals from evading capture. In some quarters, they may be called a ''Watchman's Rod'' or more informally a ''Culpritbane Cudgel''.
## Rules
One-Handed Weapons
* Effect: Once per [[Day|day]], you may call STRIKEDOWN with this one-handed weapon.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting a [[Thundering Mace]] requires eight ingots of tempest jade, eight ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]] and five ingots of [[Orichalcum|orichalcum]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
"Correction, the magistrate thinks he has a stock of Thundering Maces in the locked chest in his basement - what he actually has is a pile of driftwood fished from the river.  I swapped those maces with Big Aldo, the quartermaster in the Greenapples [[Free Company|free company]], for a sack of officer's uniforms that were on their way to be laundered.  As you know, the Greenapples run security for the Grandiose playhouse, so we use those uniforms to infiltrate during their busiest time of day and make our way to the third floor, where the [[Troupe|troupe]] keep their [[Ritual|ritual]] paraphernalia.  Spiro here [[Will|will]] run a [[Bishop]]'s Bloomers wheeze to keep all the attention up front while Carlotta and I pick the locks make our way inside.  Once we get in then we swipe everything and leave a glove so they know it was the Flash Hand mob that done the job, before exiting via the stage door onto the waiting canal boat!"
"An ingenious plan, Fortenza, with just one small flaw."
[[The Mountebank|The mountebank]] gasped as he turned towards the doorway where Magistrate Inskipp stood, glowering.  Five burly [[Bravos|bravos]] in deputised city colours stood at his back, each one wielding a fierce looking cudgel of green metal.
"You see, Fortenza, I still have my stock of Thundering Maces - what you gave to Aldo were five excellent props, supplied by the players of the Grandiose when they learned that you were planning to rob them."
Fortenza could only gape, mouth opening and closing in horror as the steel manacles were brought forth and placed on his arms.  How could all his work, all his plans have come to [[Ruin|ruin]] so quickly?  The entire Flash Hand mob pinched at once, they'd never recover from this...
"You'll have your day in court, of course." Inskipp leaned in, "But in the meantime you'll be sharing a cell with Big Aldo, and he's not too pleased with you at present"
Inskipp allowed a rare smile to cross his craggy features, "Take them away, boys!"
