## Description
These arcane weapons are reasonably rare; they are powerful only in the hands of a warrior who combines a deep understanding of [[Spellcasting#Offensive Spells|offensive magic]], including the ability to cast the spell [[Entangle]] with the puissant drive of the true [[Heroic skills#Hero points|hero]]. In the right hands, however, they are deadly. By binding an opponent in place with her magic, the wielder has several heartbeats in which they can use their advantage to deliver a crippling blow or a mortal strike.
There are more efficient weapons that can deliver [[Calls#IMPALE|crippling strikes]] against an enemy - the [[Bravo's Blade]] or [[Labyrinth's Gate]] come to mind - but using these weapons effectively requires a certain discipline and elegance that appeals to some expert warrior-magicians.
## Rules
Arcane Weapons
* Effect: After you successfully [[Entangle]] a character, you may spend a [[Heroic skills#Hero|hero point]] to call [[Calls#IMPALE|IMPALE]] when you hit the entangled character with this weapon.
* Materials: Crafting the [[Thorns of the Rose]] requires twelve ingots of [[Materials#Tempest Jade|tempest jade]], seven measures of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], five ingots of [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] and five measures of [[Materials#Iridescent Gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make a pair of these items.
