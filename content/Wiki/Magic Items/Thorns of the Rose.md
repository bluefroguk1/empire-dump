## Description
These arcane weapons are reasonably rare; they are powerful only in the hands of a Warrior who combines a deep understanding of offensive [[Magic]], including the ability to cast the spell [[Entangle]] with the puissant drive of the true hero. In the right hands, however, they are deadly. By binding an opponent in place with her magic, the wielder has several heartbeats in which they can use their advantage to deliver a crippling blow or a mortal strike.
There are more efficient weapons that can deliver crippling strikes against an enemy - the [[Bravo]]'s Blade or Labyrinth's Gate come to mind - but using these weapons effectively requires a certain discipline and elegance that appeals to some expert warrior-magicians.
## Rules
