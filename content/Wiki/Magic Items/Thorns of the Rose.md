## Description
These arcane weapons are reasonably rare; they are powerful only in the hands of a warrior who combines a deep understanding of offensive [[Magic|magic]], including the ability to cast the spell [[Entangle]] with the puissant drive of the true hero. In the right hands, however, they are deadly. By binding an opponent in place with her [[Magic|magic]], the wielder has several heartbeats in which they can use their advantage to deliver a crippling blow or a mortal strike.
There are more efficient weapons that can deliver crippling strikes against an enemy - the [[Bravo]]'s Blade or Labyrinth's [[Gate]] come to mind - but using these weapons effectively requires a certain discipline and elegance that appeals to some expert warrior-magicians.
## Rules
Arcane Weapons
* Effect: After you successfully [[Entangle]] a character, you may spend a hero point to call IMPALE when you hit the entangled character with this weapon.
* [[Materials]]: Crafting the [[Thorns of the Rose]] requires twelve ingots of [[Tempest jade|tempest jade]], seven measures of [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]], five ingots of [[Green iron|green iron]] and five measures of [[Iridescent gloaming|iridescent gloaming]]. It takes one month to make a pair of these items.
