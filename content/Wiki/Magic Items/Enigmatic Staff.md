## Description
The [[Enigmatic Staff]] taps upon the power of the [[Realm]] of Night, revealing the inner secrets of ritual [[Magic]]. These arcane implements are employed throughout [[The Empire]] to fortify the abilities of Night ritualists.
Some of these staves are of polished black wood, unobtrusive and discreet as their owners' magic. Others are intentionally bright and showy - the Enigmatic Staff of a guiser or mummer will often be [[Painted]] in rainbow colours and festooned with bells and baubles and trinkets. In [[The Brass Coast]] especially, the staves are of dark wood wrapped with gold or silver - beautiful works of art in their own right - or else blackened and charred from a few too many encounters with open flames symbolising passion and transformation. 
As with many such [[Magic Items]], these staves may be runebound. All four of the so-called [[Runes]] of night are used: [[Diras]], [[Wyr]], [[Xun]], and [[Zorech]] all appear regularly on such staves. One common practice of the [[Suaq]] and [[Kallavesi]] who make these staves in [[Wintermark]] is to include a fifth rune (often [[Queros]] or [[Pallas]]) somewhere on the staff, the location of the rune being a secret known only to the crafter and the wielder who looks for it.
Alternatively, they may have be decorated with one or more constellations such as [[The Great Wyrm]] or the Lock, either inlaid in silver or picked out in deep, lustrous gemstones. Among Urizeni crafters it is a common practice to select a single constellation that resonates strongly with the kind of magic the magician will focus on.
### [[Archmage]] Staff
The staff of the [[Archmage of Night]] is a version of the Enigmatic Staff crafted to a secret pattern, and grants twice as much power to the wielder. Unlike most such staves, the same physical staves are reforged each year; some of the staves are believed to have developed spontaneous Auras as a consequence. There are occasional rumours that the staves exert a subtle influence over the archmages of Night, similar to the [[Aura]] created by The [[Chamber of Delights]] ritual.
