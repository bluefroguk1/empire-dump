## Overview
The Prelate of Adelmar's Shrine is an [[Imperial title]] appointed by the Assembly of [[Ambition]]. The Academy of Arms was [[Expand Academy of Arms|commissioned]] by the Imperial Senate during the Spring Equinox 385YE as part of an [[Build_up_my_body#Place_of_Pilgrimage|opportunity]] to create a place of pilgrimage.

## Responsibilities
The Prelate of Adelmar's Shrine has a responsibility to protect the pilgrims who visit the Academy. In addition if the Academy of Arms were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Prelate to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Bounty of Liao
The sinecure provides ten doses of [[liao]] to the Prelate each season, to be used as they see fit.
### Voice in the Synod
The Prelate receives twenty votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]. They may use these votes in any appropriate assembly, following the [[Sinecure#Synod_Votes|normal rules for votes provided by a Sinecure]].
### Academy Training
The Prelate can allow a single [[military unit]] to train in the gymnasium and palaestra. The Prelate is able to grant permission to a single military unit to train there each season. At the end of that time, the starting military unit is upgraded by one rank to reflect the gain in skills and training. A military unit that is already upgraded is unable to gain the benefits. To use this power the Prelate player should [mailto:plot@profounddecisions.co.uk plot@profounddecisions.co.uk] with the CID of the owner of the military unit being upgraded that season.
## Academy of Arms
The Academy has a large gymnasium and palaestra where students can train and study. Along the back wall of the palaestra is a series of frescoes honouring those who were instrumental in the expansion of the Academy; a wolf with butterfly wings to honour Ranae de Rondell who was responsible for the Academy's consecration; a mighty lighthouse on a desolate rock to honour the [[Urizen_groups#The_Lighthouse_at_Nikephoros|Lighthouse at Nikephoros]] and a bright sun partially occluded by a dense web, rising over two mountains to honour Laelius of the Waxing Sun who provided the wains for the Academy's expansion.

Visitors are able to take part in the lessons the Academy offers alongside the existing students. There is extensive accommodation to house the many visitors and a small auditorium where the resident priest can deliver sermons on the life and achievements of Adelmar. The structure serves as a grand site of pilgrimage, attracting devotees of [[Ambition]] not only from across the Empire but from across the known world.

## Appointment
The Prelate of Adelmar's Shrine is a [[New_Imperial_titles#The_Imperial_Synod|virtue position]] which is [[Appointment|appointed]] by [[judgement]] of the [[Assembly#The_Virtue_Assemblies|Ambition assembly]] each year during the Summer Solstice.

The title can be held by any Imperial citizen. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Ambition Virtue Assembly, and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
