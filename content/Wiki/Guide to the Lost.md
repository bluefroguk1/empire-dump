## Overview
The Guide to the Lost is an [[Imperial title]] awarded to a citizen of the [[Imperial Orcs]]. Construction of the Open Hand of the Ancestors was [[Construct Open Hand of the Ancestors|announced]] by Bleakshield Groza as [[Legion Engineer]] during the Summer Solstice 385YE. The sinecure forms part of the Proffered Hand Network.

## Responsibilities
The Guide to the Lost has no particular responsibilities beyond the safety of the sinecure. If the Open Hand of the Ancestors were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Guide to the Lost to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[opportunity]] were to arise related to the Open Hand, the Guide would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.

## Powers
### A Portion of Liao
The sinecure provides 6 doses of [[liao]] to the Guide to the Lost each season, to be used as they see fit. 

### Voice in the Synod
The Guide to the Lost may sit in the [[Imperial Synod]], and possesses 12 votes in Synod affairs (or an additional 12 votes if they already have a [[congregation]]). They may use these votes in any assembly for which [[Sinecure#Synod_Votes|they are eligible]].

## Appointment
The Guide to the Lost is an [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial Orc]] [[appointment]] made by a [[judgement]] of the Imperial Orcs [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]]. This is a national title and can only be held by a citizen of the Imperial Orcs.

As with most sinecures, this appointment has [[tenure]]. The assumption is that the Guide to the Lost retains the position until they die or step down. They can be [[Revocation|revoked]] by a lesser majority of the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Assembly of the Nine, or by the Imperial Orcs National Assembly.
