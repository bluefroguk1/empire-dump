## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects

The [[herb garden]] produces an extra two drams of each herb over the next season. 





### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional herb gardens in the same territory. Each additional herb garden increases the magnitude by 6. The character who controls each herb garden must be present throughout the ritual.

## Description
This spell is harsh but effective. It kills vermin that might damage growing plants and protects a [[herb garden]] from disease, but the magic of the enchantment also ruthlessly destroys any weed or plant that does not have medicinal value that grows in the garden. The dead plants serve as compost for their more valuable siblings. When working in the herb garden, it is easy to see which plants are likely to produce strong medicinal preparations and which would be better off removed; with a simple twitch of a trowel or a snip of secateurs, the weak plant is gone and the other plants in the garden will grow a little taller as a consequence.

This ritual is quite old and has been practised in places such as [[Navarr]] and [[Varushka]] since time-out-of-mind. It is cruel, but valuable, and by ruthlessly tending the herb garden, its owner produces many more medicines to aid their people. Those wise in the ways of Winter would say there is a lesson there ...

## Common Elements
The ritual encourages hardy plants to become even hardier and kills plants that are weak. Ritual performances occasionally include the evocation of the rune [[Bravash]], but are much more likely to include [[Irremais]], the Rune of Wisdom. Sometimes a [[Wintermark]] ritualist will include [[Gralm]] and [[Ull]] to represent difficult choices. Hearth magics and symbols associated with tradition, health, and [[Wisdom]] are also commonly evoked, such as shedding small amounts of blood or offering a cup or bowl of wine, ale, milk, or mead to the targets.

This ritual is sometimes combined with an invocation to the eternal [[Wise Rangara]], or to a [[Paragons and Exemplars|paragon or exemplar]] of [[Wisdom]], [[Vigilance]], or [[Courage]].
