Chords: Am G Em x4


Chorus
The limbs, the veins, the head and the heart
The earth, the roots, the leaves and the bark
The limbs, the veins, the head and the heart
The earth, the roots, the leaves and the bark

Chorus

Verse 1
For shelter and shade has the oak tree grown
(The limbs, the veins, the head and the heart)
The boat and cradle, the hearth and home
(The earth, the roots, the leaves and the bark)

Verse 2
Tear the leaves and the crops will fail
(The limbs, the veins, the head and the heart)
Cut the branch and your ships wonâ€™t sail
(The earth, the roots, the leaves and the bark)

Chorus

Verse 3
Arms so strong they hold the sky
(The limbs, the veins, the head and the heart)
Fell the tree and the heart won't die
(The earth, the roots, the leaves and the bark)

Verse 4
What dies when the sea returns?
(The limbs, the veins, the head and the heart)
What grows when the black rain burns?
(The earth, the roots, the leaves and the bark)

Chorus

Instrumental

Verse 5
For seven generations the oak trees grow
(The limbs, the veins, the head and the heart)
The roots reach deep to the rocks and bones
(The earth, the roots, the leaves and the bark)
