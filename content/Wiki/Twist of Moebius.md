## Rules

### Performing the Ritual




### Effects

This ritual allows the [[Groups#Covens|coven]] that casts it to perform one additional ritual on the day after it is performed.

Performing ''Twist of Moebius'' always counts as a use of the [[Groups#Covens|coven]] bond and counts towards the number of rituals the coven can perform that day. 

The ritual counts as an [[enchantment]] on the coven (or the coven bond itself) rather than the individual ritualists.

The effect of the enchantment takes effect immediately and lasts until the additional ritual is performed, or until the sun has risen twice, whichever comes first.

## Description

This ritual captures the potential to perform a ritual and temporarily seals it in place, to allow the [[Groups#Covens|coven]] to perform an additional ritual the next day. It is worth noting that the power of this [[enchantment]] goes into effect immediately; even though the ritual cannot be performed until after the next sunrise.

The ritual was first formalised by the [[The League|League]] magician Bridenal von Temeschwar who used it to great effect both to allow for extra rituals to be performed immediately prior to (or in some cases, during) a battle and to allow his coven to arrange for multiple castings of [[Rivers of Gold]] during prestigious performances. Bridenal and his troupe were slain during the reign of [[Empress Giselle]] during her retreat from [[Holberg]]. According to some rumours, the final performance of Bridenal's ''Twist of Moebius'' is still sealed in a lacquered oak box; stories say that if it were recovered a coven would be able to draw not only on the ability to perform an extra ritual but on the potence of Bridenal's entire coven (despite the fact that, as several [[Urizen]] scholars have claimed over the years, this would be quite impossible - the [[Mountebank|mountebanks]] of the League do not let these 'facts' get in the way of a good story). Perhaps of more value would be the [[The Iron Labyrinth|Iron Labyrinth covenstone]] belonging to Bridenal's [[troupe]].

## Common Elements
The ritual often involves taking a strip of paper, parchment or cloth, giving it a twist and sealing the ends together to create a shape that seems to have only one surface. The strip is then usually sealed in a box or sack until it is needed. When the magic is unleashed the strip is cut or destroyed. Some covens create a similar effect by inscribing a glyph, rune (often [[Hirmok]]) or sigil on themselves or an item that can be destroyed. These elements are not vital to the creation of the enchantment - it will still work if the element is lost, it simply requires a little more effort the next day to release the stored energy.
