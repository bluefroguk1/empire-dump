### Overview
The Valiant Pegasus is a relatively new army; recruitment was only completed in 378YE. Initially, the force incorporates some of the finest Highborn siege architects, and was well prepared both to take advantage of Imperial [[fortifications]] and bring down barbarian strongholds. Following the [[Iron_and_wine#Opportunity: The Quality of Mercy|opportunity]] offered by the celebration of [[Empress Lisabetta]], the [[Valiant Pegasus]] refocused its efforts to the [[Army_qualities#Physick|preservation of life]] on the battlefield, supported by many apothecaries. As a new army, it has yet to establish a particular identity or reputation for itself.

The third Highborn General leads the Valiant Pegasus, and is appointed (or re-appointed) at the Spring equinox each year.
