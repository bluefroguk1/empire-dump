## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must possess the [[Magical skills#Battle Mage|battle mage]] skill.



### Effects

The target character gains two additional ranks of [[Combat skills#Endurance|endurance]], but only while wearing [[Weapons & armour#Mage_Armour|mage armour]]. 

They are also under a [[roleplaying effect]]; you feel confident in their personal prowess, and certain that your magic is a match for any challenge they may encounter.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 6. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This ritual, also known as the Thunder of the Stag's Heart and the Prism of the Glorious Soul empowers a [[Magical skills#Magician|magician]] to make greater use of their [[Weapons & armour#Mage Armour|mage armour]]. The protective ability of the armour is enhanced, but the ritual achieves that by enhancing the aura of the wearer rather than the armour itself. Battle-magicians, especially [[Dawn|Dawnish]] war-witches and [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial orc]] [[Imperial Orcs magical traditions#Warcasters|warcasters]] make extensive use of this [[enchantment]], preparing themselves for the dangers of the battlefield.  Some mages feel that the ritual can lead to dangerous over-confidence in battle, or speculate it may magnify personality flaws with repeated use.

## Common Elements
This ritual usually involves the magician and their mage amour. The armour is often donned as part of the performance, each piece accompanied by an invocation or marked with a rune or symbol. It is common for a [[Groups#Covens|coven]] of battle-magicians who have gained some knowledge of Summer rituals to perform this ritual together on their own coven, the morning before they take the field. 

Another common element is marking key points on the body that correspond roughly to the locations where mage armour is worn (the brow, the shoulders, the forearms, the shins, the belly, the chest and the neck), or (especially for a [[Navarr magical traditions#Vates|vate]]) spilling a few drops of blood from those locations before donning the mage armour.

The rune [[Feresh]] is often used with this ritual, and evocations of [[The Stallion]], of horses or bears, and especially of [[Legendary beasts#Gryphons|gryphons]].
