## Description
The Blackwillow Twist is a flexible, resilient weapon whose head is usually made of greensteel (an alloy of [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]]), and whose haft is treated with [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]]. In the hands of even a relatively green recruit it can render an opponent [[Calls#STRIKEDOWN|briefly helpless]], allowing the wielder to strike while the enemy is off-guard, or make a swift retreat.

## Rules

* Effect: Once per day you may call [[Calls#STRIKEDOWN|STRIKEDOWN]] with this one-handed spear.
* Materials: Crafting a Blackwillow Twist requires eight ingots of [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]] and five ingots of [[Materials#Ambergelt|ambergelt]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.
