## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must be a [[Rituals#Contributors|contributor]] participating in the performance of the ritual.


### Effects
This enchantment allows the target to call [[Calls#Mass Calls|MASS]] [[Calls#ENTANGLE|ENTANGLE]] once during the duration. The character must be able to cast spells to make this call - it explicitly will not work if they are wearing armour. 

While under the effect of the enchantment, the target experiences a [[roleplaying effect]]: the target feels an urge to organise everyone around them, especially on the battlefield. The need for people to be in the correct "place" (literally or metaphorical) nags at them constantly. In a non-martial context, this effect urges them to try and arrange political promotions for their allies, and demotions for their enemies. During a fight, they find it hard not to shout orders at those nearby. The effect is particularly pronounced if the subject is of the [[cambion]] [[lineage]]; it is all too easy for them to overtly treat others as playing pieces to be moved around as suits their long-term goals.

 The power of the ritual can be invoked only ''once'' during this time.

### Additional Targets
The ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude of the spell by 25. Additional characters must be present throughout, and each must [[Rituals#Contributors|contribute]] to the performance of the ritual.

## Description
This battlefield ritual allows a powerful magical attack to be unleashed against a group of enemies. It binds them in place for a short time, allowing the magician's allies to overwhelm them if they act quickly. It is especially useful when used to support soldiers with [[Weapons & armour#Pole-arms|pole-arms]] against enemies with short weapons, or to pin down skirmishers so that [[Combat skills#Marksman|archers]] can devastate them with arrows or crossbow bolts. 

Of all the similar battlefield rituals, this is the easiest to perform, but it also requires the most strategic thinking if it is to have an impact. Unless the magician's allies are prepared to take advantage of the period of confusion the power of this ritual provides, then it is likely to be wasted. One place where the ritual excels is in capturing high-value targets; the ability to entangle a group of opponents from a distance (albeit a short distance) is a rare power usually unavailable to even the most powerful magician. The magic is also indiscriminate - it can be hurled into a group, entangling them all, and then the target can be picked out of the (hopefully) subdued unit. Finally, unlike rituals such as [[Howling Despite of the Yawning Maw]], the magic has no lasting effect on those caught by it - which means that it is less important to ensure no allies are caught in the area.

## Common Elements
When performing this ritual, a coven often invokes symbols of binding, stagnation and hesitation. Some magicians weave invocations of doubt and uncertainty, while others evoke subtle forces intended to subvert the battle-plans of their enemies. Skirling pipe-music may often be involved, as might interweaving flutes. Sinuous dances are common, but so are things that bind - chains, threads, ropes, nets and even ribbons.

Other common elements in this ritual might include runes, especially [[Hirmok]]. Beasts such as spiders and great serpents that crush their prey may be mentioned, and some [[The Brass Coast|Freeborn]] use images of octopi, squid or even [[Mundane beasts#Kraken|kraken]] in their magic. The constellation of [[The Chain]] are sometimes invoked, as are the names of the Autumn [[eternal|eternals]] known as the [[Lictors]].

If the ritual draws additional power from the use of ambergelt, it is common to dissolve the material in strong alcohol and use it to paint runes on the target's clothing, [[Weapons_%26_armour#Mage_Armour|mage armour]]. and [[Weapons_%26_armour#Implements|implement]]. Such a solution sets quickly, leaving behind resinous, translucent runes and sigils.
