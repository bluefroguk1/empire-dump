There is a central library, which incorporates many of the writings held in the [[Anvil#The_Anvil_Library|Anvil Library]].

There are seven smaller chapels within the seminary, each dedicated to one of the virtues. At the centre of each chapel stands a hearth fire, which copies the design of the national hearth fire on show during Anvil summits. Each chapel has symbolism throughout showing animals of the appropriate virtue.
