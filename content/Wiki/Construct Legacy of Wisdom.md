__NOTOC__
An announcement by bearer of an Imperial Wayleave, Edmundo. To construct a great work in Morrow to enhance the production of mana. To be known as ‘Lorenzo’s Legacy of Wisdom.’ At a cost of 40 wains of mithril and 10 thrones to be funded by ‘La Volpe’ and the Bloody Butchers of Temeschwar.''Imperial Wayleave by of Damakan's Forge''
## Overview
* Constructs a [[great work]] in [[Morrow]].
* Announcement
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## Costs
* This [[great work]] uses [[Great_work#Costs|standard costs]].
* 40 wains of mithril
* 80 crowns labour
* Three months to complete
## Progress
* 40 wains of mithril and 10 Thrones provided by Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar following the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* Due to the Druj invasion of Morrow, all progress was lost. Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar received a partial refund after the Summer Solstice 382Y.
## Outcome
* The Druj [[382YE_Autumn_Equinox_winds_of_war#Lost_in_the_Echo_.28Morrow.29|invasion of Morrow]] resulted in the destruction of the construction site of the central stellae and several smalelr stelae. As such the contributor received a partial refund for materials and labour costs. In theory if Caeli were recaptured before the Summer Solstice 383YE, construction could be begun again without the need for either another senate motion or a new commission, but work would need to start from scratch.
* When complete, the commission would have created a great work that distributes 37 crystal mana between the [[mana site|mana sites]] of [[Morrow]].
