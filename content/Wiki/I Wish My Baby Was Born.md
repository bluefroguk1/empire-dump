Very slightly filked lyrics below: 


I wish, I wish my baby was born
And sitting on its papa's knee
And me, poor girl, were dead and gone
And the cold marsh growing o'er my feet

I ain't ahead, nor never will be
Till the sweet apple grows on a sour apple tree
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I shall be as one

I wish, I wish my love had died
And sent his soul to wander free
Then we might meet where ravens fly
Let our poor bodies rest in peace

(optional)
The owl, the owl is a lonely bird
It chills my heart with grief and terror
That someone's blood there on his wing
That someone's blood there on his feathers.
