## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 

This ritual targets an [[Imperial armies|Imperial army]]. The [[Imperial Military Council|general]] responsible for the army (or the [[egregores|egregore]] if the general is not at Anvil) must be present throughout.


Cut Them Down
* Attacking order
* Casualties inflicted by this army are increased by three tenths
* Casualties suffered by this army are increased by a fifth
The army takes every opportunity to engage with the enemy to try and cut them down. They may claim some territory, but this is secondary to their goal of slaughtering as many of the enemy as possible. This emphasis on engaging the enemy means that the army loses more troops itself; but the commitment to fighting and preparations it takes mean that it suffers comparatively less than the opponents it engages.

### Effects
This ritual enchants a campaign army, filling the soldiers with a passionate fervour to see their enemies defeated. The army loses any existing [[army qualities|quality]] and gains the ''[[Army qualities#Relentless|Relentless]]'' quality for the duration. For the duration the general can issue the order ''cut them down'' when [[army orders#Attacking|attacking]].

While the enchantment persists, the general responsible for the army experiences a roleplaying effect: ''you are filled with confidence and assertiveness, and are driven both to take responsibility for others and to “get things done”. Anyone who stands between you and your goals should be dealt with swiftly and without mercy.''

## Description
This ritual was one of the very first to become part of [[Urizen magical traditions#Urizen lore|Urizen lore]], following the Autumn Equinox 383YE. Contributed by Mord Thorntarry of the [[spire]] of Auric Horizen, the ritual was one of those contained in the book ''Meditations''. Written by Callus Strategos, [[Dean of the Lyceum]] during the reign of [[Empress Britta]], the book also contained [[Good Green Oak]], [[Hook of the Hoarfrost Guardian]], [[Eyes of the Hills]] and two rituals that had already become part of [[Imperial lore]] - [[Find the Best Path]] and [[Hammers of the Brilliant Shore]].

Soldiers in the army enchanted by this ritual are filled with a passionate fervour, driven by a desire to absolutely crush their enemies. These powerful emotions are harnessed to their will however; they are no more likely to fight among themselves than normal, reserving their passion for their enemies. A soldier can switch between calm detachment or pleasant demeanour to murderous intensity in a moment, and then return to their normal disposition just as swiftly once a threat is overcome - something which can be quite unsettling to observers who do not know what is going on.

''Meditations'' records that the eternal [[Meraud]] offered helpful advice during the formulation of the original ritual, but the magicians of the Lyceum chose not to directly involve any eternal in its creation reasoning that giving an eternal another method to influence the Imperial armies was not ideal. When the ritual was originally codified, General Clarisse de Rhenai of the [[Golden Sun]] and Gundal of the [[Green Shield]] reportedly fought a duel for the right to be the first to be enchanted with it. The Dawnish general was the victor and the first target of the ritual. According to Callus, there was some concern among members of the [[Sevenfold Path]] that the passions inflamed by the enchantment might be seen as inspiring a [[Malign_spiritual_presences|malign spiritual presence]], and indeed the magician was eventually called to [[inquisition]] over its effects. He was acquitted however and the ritual went on to be used several times during the campaigns of Empress Brennan against the Druj.

## Common Elements
This ritual enhances a campaign army, and the general of the target army serves as a vital focus for delivering the magic. IA banner or standard that will be used by the target force makes an ideal additional focus for the ritual. The magic involves unleashing powerful emotions that urge an army to violence, and as such the general should be urged to maintain their [[Urizen_culture_and_customs#Poise|poise]] - to harness the destructive passions to the will so that they may be used with precision rather than risk overflowing and turning against those who experience them. As such, a form of guided meditation may be employed in which the target is inspired to view the raging will for victory that the magic inflames as a weapon to be wielded only against their enemies.  

The [[astronomancy|astronomantic]] constellation of [[the Mountain]] has a strong association with this ritual, but [[The Drowned Man]] also has resonance - the ultimate aim of the enchantment is to end a conflict in an absolutely decisive fashion after all. Those [[Urizen]] who make use of the [[runes]] may find [[Jotra]] and [[Tykonus]] resonate with its power, but the [[Aesh|Rune of Thought]] an the [[Zorech|Rune of Passion]] is also applicable - the one harnesses the other in pursuit of the general's goals. 

While their power is not directly involved in this ritual (indeed, according to the original source the magicians of the Lyceum made a conscious decision to decline offers of direct assistance from the inhabitants of the Summer realm), the names of [[Eleonaris]] and [[Meraud]] might be evoked as part of the performance.
