We should give official recognition to the loyalty of those military unit commanders who commit their troops to support our armies in the field. We suggest a roll of honour be posted each season listing those who have aided each campaign.
''Proposed by Kallavesa, seconded by Astolat.''

## Spring 377YE

### Overview
* A public record of [[military unit|military units]] aiding [[Imperial armies]] to be produced and made public.
* Passed unanimously.

### Cost
* The Civil Service compiles this information for the benefit of the [[Military Council]]; as such additional costs involved in creating an additional copy for purposes of the roll of honour are negligible.

### Progress
* [[Imperial Roll of Honour]] created.

### Campaign Outcome
When the civil servants compile lists of recent military campaigns for the Military Council, an additional copy of the information will be made and disseminated via the Hub.

It is worth noting that if this information were not already being compiled, or if many additional copies were required, the costs would likely be significantly higher.

## Winter 377YE
That the Roll Of Honour defined in Senate sessions passim is available in the Imperial Public Library for all citizens to see.
''Proposed by Hahnmark, seconded by Volodmartz.''

### Overview
* The public record of [[military unit|military units]] aiding [[Imperial armies]] to be recorded for posterity.
* Passed unanimously.

### Progress
* Complete
