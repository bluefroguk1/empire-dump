The Navigators lyrics by Jude Reid

To the tune of Sacred Harp 121 (Florence), [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZnUyJvIulc recording and score on youtube], tune is the middle line.
-------------


So many times the stars have turned
Since in those days of yore
The Navigators first set sail
To seek a distant shore
Through chilling winds and beating rains,
Through waters deep and cold,
Their enemies surrounding them,
Take courage and be bold.

Though storms and hurricanes arise,
And foes be all around,
And foul Eternals may appear,
To profane the sacred ground.
Dark nights and clouds and gloomy fear â€”
And dragons fearsome roar 
We'll hold as fast as heros of old
Who sailed for Highguard's shore.
