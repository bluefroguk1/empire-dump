## Overview
Marshal of the Pit of Revelations is an [[Imperial Orcs|Imperial Orc]] [[Imperial title]] created following an [[Construct Pit of Revelations|announcement]] during the Spring Equinox 383YE by the [[Bearer_of_an_Imperial_Wayleave#The_Orc_Wayleave|Bearer of the Imperial Orcs Wayleave]]. The construction was completed shortly before the 383YE Summer Solstice. The position of Marshal of the Pit of Revelations is a [[sinecure]] in [[Skarsind]], requiring minimal responsibility but offering a regular income of crystal mana. 
## Responsibilities

If the Pit itself were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Marshal to deal with those threats  - but also to deal with any opportunity to expand the sinecure, or to make any decisions about its operation.
## Powers
### Bounty of Mana
The Marshal has custodianship of a sinecure and receives an income of 9 crystal mana each season.
## Appointment
The Marshal of the Pit of Revelations is appointed by unanimous decision of the [[Imperial Orcs]] [[senator|senator]]. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, the title [[Appointments_by_the_Senate#National_Position|may be appointed]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] instead.

The title can be held by a Imperial Orc citizen. The Marshal has [[tenure]], and serves until they die or step down. They can be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Imperial Orc [[Assembly#The_National_Assemblies|National Assembly]], and by the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].
