## Overview
This page lists all the details that are specific for the Winter Solstice 2015. There is an additional page with [[event information]] which lists arrival and departure times and similar details that are common for all Empire events.

## IC News
Please see the [[378YE Winter Solstice winds of fortune]] for the latest IC developments known throughout the Empire.

For the Civil Service events set to occur and at what location, please refer to the [[378YE_Winter_Solstice_civil_service_timetable]]

## Battles
At the event we will be running two large battles, one Saturday morning and one Sunday morning. The large battles will follow the normal rules for [[battles]]; you may only participate in a single battle as your character and you must monster the other battle if you decide to participate in one. The sides for the battles will be chosen by the generals in the [[Muster]] of the [[Imperial Military Council]] on Friday night. 

The fighting begins at 11:00 am - but if you are playing the battle then you will need to muster up before this time and if you are monstering then you need to make your way to the monster area for 10:00 am to give us time to get you into costume, made-up and briefed.

## Quests
Sadly our backup site does not have any woods, so we are developing out a new plan this year to take advantage of the open spaces that we have instead. As part of this plan we're aiming to run larger quests than last year, with more players and monsters on them.

There are over 50 members of the Hundred booked already for the event, but to make the most of the space we'd like to try and run larger quests that that. To make these encounters as awesome as possible, we are asking players who like the existing quests to consider volunteering a second time during each event. This will allow us to run a lot more fights for everyone.

To help us organize folk, we've set aside a slot for each nation to volunteer to monster, which are listed below.

Monstering during this slot is purely voluntary - but it will help us put on a much better event for everyone. To try and make things as fair as possible, our plan is to track the number of volunteers coming from each nation on an ongoing basis and use that to create equivalent sized quest opportunities for those nations at the next event. In effect, we'll try and deliver more fights to the nations that volunteer the most - on the assumption that those nations contain the players who want those opportunities the most.
## Site Map
The map shows the layout of the IC and OOC areas for the event with the location of each nation's camp site. The roads will be marked with fencing pins and rope as usual. There is a narrow strip of land around the edge of each field which is deliberately set aside for use by birds and wildlife. This area will be fenced off, as you ''must'' make sure that you do not drive or camp there.

The camp coordinators for each camp will have their own layout for their camp, showing where all the tents they know about are to be pitched. If you do not know where you are supposed to be camping, then please speak to them on arrival at your nation's camp.

No unescorted vehicles are allowed off the road in the IC camping area - you may only use the road indicated by the black dashed line that circles around each field. The road will be wide enough for you to pull up and park so that you can unload your vehicle next to your camp. Please unload your camping equipment and then move your vehicle to the car park before putting up your tent to allow other players to unload.

If you have a trailer or a large vehicle filled with heavy kit then you may drive that on to the field to unload. To do that you must wait at the IC entrance to the field. A member of the PD security team will then escort you vehicle to your camp where you can unload your vehicle. Once you are ready to move your vehicle to the car park you must request a member of the PD team escort your vehicle off the field.


## OOC Camping
The OOC camping area will be laid out in lines so that people can pitch their tent next to their car. The gate team will direct you where to park. The section of the OOC camp nearest to the IC area will be set aside for any player with mobility issues as normal. Please ask the gate crew for directions if you are eligible to camp here.

### Quiet Camp
The map shows one of the fields laid out for quiet camping. We have spoken to most of the residents of the nearby village of Spernall and they have been incredibly friendly and welcoming. However we are determined to show our gratitude for that by ensuring that we cause as little disturbance for them as possible. For this reason we have marked this area of the site for quiet camping. Anyone is welcome to camp here, but we will require anyone staying in this field to ensure that they keep the noise to a reasonable level after 10 pm. If you want to party then use the IC fields or the main OOC caming area.
