## Rules


### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects
This ritual calls forth a band of [[Adamant|koboldi]] from the depths of a [[mine]]. They form a powerful [[military unit]] under the control of the character who owns the target mine, and fight under that character's command during the coming season.

The target mine produces no special [[materials]] during the coming season; they are claimed by the [[eternal]] [[Adamant]]. At the end of the season production is returned to normal.

The military unit created consists of supernatural troops that can be [[Military_unit#Downtime_Options|assigned]] any of the tasks that a normal military unit can undertake. While they are effective at all these tasks, the warriors are especially well suited to [[Military_unit#Defend_Fortification|defending a fortification]] and receive a five rank bonus (equivalent to an additional 100 fighting force) when they do so.

### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional mines in the same [[territory]]. Each additional mine increases the magnitude by 15. The character who controls each mine must be present throughout the ritual, and each receives control of their own military unit.

## Assurance
The magic of this ritual is sufficient to summon heralds of Adamant even if the Imperial Conclave has declared enmity with the eternal but doing so not only has legal implications but is likely to anger the Throne of Stone.

The ritual loses all power and becomes useless if there is ever a season where there are no fortifications in Urizen territory. for purposes of the agreement only permanent fortifications created with white granite count - magical fortresses such as those created by Frozen Citadel of Cathan Canae do not count. The ritual's power might be restored by renegotiation with Adamant but it is by no means certain it would function the same way.
Of the three rituals in ''A Year of Perfect Stillness'', I think that this one is the most useful. In return for the right to claim the magical metals produced by a mine, a cohort of ''koboldi'' come to serve the owner in battle. While they may be short, they excel as defenders of a fortified position. They are also delightfully friendly, polite company,  with a boundless capacity for wonder, which is certainly a refreshing change for those more used to the... difficult... personalities of some other inhabitants of the Summer Realm.
## Description
This ritual became part of Urizen lore during Winter 383YE along with [[Stone's Unyielding Defiance]] and [[Vital Strength of the Earth]]. All three rituals were contained in ''A Year of Perfect Stillness'', a tome of magic owned by the magicians of [[Redoubt#Delving|Delving]], a spire known for their expertise in working stone, in engineering, and in mining. They are also on good terms with [[Adamant]], and ''Raise the Dragonsworn Cohort'' draws on that [[eternal|eternal's]] power. By all accounts the ''King Under the Mountain'' is inclined to help the people of Urizen. The creation of the [[Morrow#The_Three_Watchers|Three Watchers]] and the [[383YE_Summer_Solstice_Synod_judgements#Judgement_49|public thanks]] issued by the Urizen [[assembly]], as well as the [[mandate]] encouraging Urizeni to [[383YE_Autumn_Equinox_Synod_judgements#Judgement_24|work with eternals]] all apparently factored in to the architects of Delving receiving his blessing to share the magic he helped to create.

Home to a number of respected [[architect|architects]], they were among the first to see the potential benefits of sharing some of their personal lore with their fellow Urizeni. [[Arbiter]] Severus presented the [[Some_heavenly_music#The_Architects_of_Stone|opportunity to gain access to the book's rituals]] in return for an [[appraisal]] commissioned by the [[Imperial Senate]] to [[A place on a map|identify sites for new fortifications in Urizen]]. When the Senate did so, representatives of the Spire delivered the scrolls that make up ''A Year of Perfect Stillness'' to [[Anvil]] and it was duly added to Urizen lore.

The ritual works differently to similar rituals such as [[Carve the Crystal Guardian]] or [[Conclave of Trees and Shadow]]. Rather than drawing on the magic of the [[Resource#Personal_Resource|resource]] to embody spirits from the Summer realm, ''Raise the Dragonsworn Cohort'' is significantly more transactional in nature. Adamant dispatches a unit of ''koboldi'' soldiers to fight for the person who owns the [[enchantment|enchanted]] [[mine]], while the ''Stone Dragon'' claims everything it would have produced over the season for their great hoard. 

The size and experience of the ''koboldi'' warband is directly proportionate to the size of the enchanted mine, and they excel at [[Military_unit#Defend_Fortification|defending]] a [[fortification]]. They are also, by all accounts, unfailing polite, pleasant, cheerful, and upbeat even in the face of defeat. They are also endlessly fascinated by the mortal world, and possess an almost child-like capacity for wonder... while at the same time being skilled and terrible combatants equipped with a wide variety of fine quality magical armour and weapons. 

A note in the ritual remarks that the ''colour'' of the ''koboldi'' seems to be related to the primary material produced in the mine. An [[orichalcum]] mine sees golden- or emerald-scaled ''koboldi'' arrive to fight on behalf of the owner. [[Weltsilver]] seems to result in silver- or crimson-scaled warriors, while [[green iron]] leads to bronze-, copper-, or sable-scaled ''koboldi'' heralds appearing. [[Tempest jade]] appears to invariably produce azure-scaled ''koboldi'' who express a particular enjoyment in shattering the weapons, shields, and armours of enemy combatants.

(''OOC Note: Under most circumstances, the koboldi summoned during Profound Decisions events will, unfortunately, have to remain primarily as a downtime or plot resource rather than something that can be used on the field. At player events, this might not be the case; but we cannot commit to phys-repping koboldi at short notice nor can they be used in uptime battles due to their inability to pass the Sentinel Gate.'')

## Common Elements
The ritual often involves a map of the mine to be [[enchantment|enchanted]]; in the case of the [[Urizen]] a map of the entire area may be studied, and that information woven into the invocation itself. Where possible the ritual is performed using materials that come from the mine in question although this is not a requirement. If the ritual is performed with the intent that the ''koboldi'' protect a particular [[fortification]], maps of that castle's location might also be an element. Unsurprisingly, the eternal Adamant is almost invariably invoked as part of the performance.

Other common features include minerals from the target area; valuable crystals of gemstones; symbols of [[Loyalty]]; or weapons and armour (or implements and mage armour), especially enchanted version of those items.
