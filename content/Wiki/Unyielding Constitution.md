## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
 



### Effects

The target may ignore the [[roleplaying effects]] of traumatic wounds. The traumatic wound is still present, and can be healed as normal, but the target can endure the wound without penalty... until it kills them.

The target experiences a [[roleplaying effects|roleplaying effect]]; the target finds it increasingly difficult to care about injuries that are not incapacitating, and often forgets to seek out healing unless reminded to do so.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Banners|banner]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 7. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

This ritual is often used in advance of situations where warriors know they will receive desperate injuries, allowing them to keep fighting. Warriors who find themselves in the thick of battle often embrace it, although in some battles it is much more useful than others. An engagement that includes wights, powerful beasts or the cruel weapons of the [[Druj]] barbarians are all much more likely to result in complications for the warriors involved.

The [[eternal]] [[Sorin]] is known to offer boons that enhance or empower the casting of this ritual, and it is sometimes known as ''That Which Does Not Kill Us'' after a saying allegedly attributed to the callous eternal king.

## Common Elements
Common elements include washing away blood, especially with melted snow, but may also include rubbing soil into the injured location (especially when the caster or the target is a [[The Marches|Marcher]]). [[paragons and exemplars]] may be invoked, especially those associated with determination and resilience, and the rune [[Jotra]] or [[Rhyv]] is used to encourage fortitude and determination as are the constellations of [[The Oak]] or [[The Drowned Man]].
