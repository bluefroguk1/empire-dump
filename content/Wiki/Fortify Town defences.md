Defensive improvements required for towns in the League, Marches and Highguard.
''Proposed by Mitwold, seconded by Temeschwar.''

### Overview
* Defensive improvements required for towns in [[The League]], [[The Marches]] and [[Highguard]]
* Passed at 60 Thrones with 13 votes against, money distributed to Senator Mitwold.

### Date
* Passed Winter 376YE (Easter 2013)

### Cost
* 40 wains of White Granite will provide sufficient fortification to suppress banditry in these regions
* 300 wains of White Granite are required to fortify these regions

### Progress
* 40 wains of White Granite presented by Bridget Eastville nee Talbot, Senator for [[Mitwold]] in Winter Solstice 2013 downtime

### Constitution
* This motion does not follow constitutional protocol
Senate motions should only contain a single item. The motion was not struck down by magistrates at the time and the construction has now begun.

### Campaign Outcome
* Banditry in League, Marches and Highguard suppressed
* [[Mitwold#Meade|Meade]], [[Bastion#Sybela|Sybela]] and [[Temeschwar#Mellfort|Mellfort]] have been partially fortified.
Partial fortification does not confer a military advantage. It is sufficient to redress the banditry problems in those areas, but not sufficient to class as a separate fortification. It would require a total of 260 additional wains of White Granite to complete the three [[fortifications]].
