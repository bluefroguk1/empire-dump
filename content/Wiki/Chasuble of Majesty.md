## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
   The target character must possess the [[Religious skills#Dedication|dedication]] skill.

 

### Effects
When the target [[Religious skills#Performing a ceremony|performs]] or [[Religious skills#Cooperation|cooperates]] in the performance of a [[Religious skills|religious skill]], they may spend up to two additional doses of [[liao]] to increase the [[Religious skills#Ceremony Strength|strength]] of the ceremony by the same amount.

In addition, they may choose to respond to any [[roleplaying effect]] that would cause them to doubt or abandon their cause, philosophy, or beliefs with a declaration of certainty and bolstered commitment.



### Additional Targets
This ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Sect|sect]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude by 8. Additional characters must be present throughout.

## Description

It is easy to focus solely on the physical and war-like potence of the magic of Summer, but as this [[enchantment]] demonstrates there is much more to the Realm than that. This ritual enhances and strengthens the spiritual powers of a priest, allowing them to perform more potent ceremonies through the use of additional [[liao]].

While some priests are concerned about allowing magic to influence them, there are many more who see the strength this ritual can grant in a very positive light. Whether they are creating a potent [[Religious skills#Consecrate|consecration]] or [[Religious skills#Exorcism|exorcising]] a [[Malign Spiritual Presences|force of corruption]], the usefulness of ''Chasuble of Majesty'' cannot be denied. Indeed, the ritual was first used extensively by [[Highguard|Highborn]] [[Magister|magisters]], and some religious magicians point to it as proof that magic is another tool for humanity to use in pursuit of its glorious destiny.

The ritual is named for the travelling garment popular among pre-Imperial pilgrims, although it is also commonly called ''Mantle of Majesty''. A roughly oval piece of tough woollen cloth, with a hole in the centre through which to pass the head, falling below the knees on all sides and gathered up on the arms to allow them to be used freely. It became associated with several early [[chapters]] and as the Way spread, so too did the chasuble. While it was eventually replaced by the beautiful robes favoured by high ranking priests today, the chasuble remains popular with some sects, especially among the priests of the Assembly of the Way.

## Common Elements
This ritual often incorporates religious imagery of the [[The_Way#The_Paths_of_Virtue|Imperial Virtues]]. Some magicians, especially in [[Wintermark]] use the seven accepted [[Runes#Runes and the Imperial Faith|runes of the faith]] when they perform the ritual, but others prefer to focus more on symbols of the Way, especially the seven-spoked wheel.
