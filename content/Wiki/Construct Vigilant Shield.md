__NOTOC__
To build a liao sinecure in Casinea called the Vigilant Shield, creating a title ‘Captain of the Throne Guard’. Responsibilities: to organise and lead the Throne Guard at Anvil, to protect the person of the Throne. Appointed annually by the Throne. Recallable by the Assembly of Nine and the General Assembly. Self-funded. Proposed by Reikos, seconded by Necropolis
## Overview
* An attempt to create a [[sinecure]] for use of the Captain of the Throne Guard
* Passed
## Date
* Summer 383YE
## Costs
* Unknown

## Progress
* 10 wains of white granite and 20 crowns provided by Severin Teyhard von Holberg after Summer Solstice 383YE.

## Outcome
* The intent is that the Vigilant Shield would be placed in the custody of the new [[Imperial title]], [[Captain of the Throne Guard]].

## Constitution
* It is not possible to make a sinecure that provides liao without an [[opportunity]] - so the viable constitutional interpretation of this motion is to commission a sinecure that provides both votes and liao.
