## Overview
The Champion of Wisdom is an [[Imperial title]] that was [[383YE_Winter_Solstice_Senate_sessions#Create titles of Champions of Virtue|created]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 383YE. The title would confer custodianship of the [[Magic_items#Artefacts|artifact]] [[Pilgrim's Shield]] known as ''Measure'', were it to be recovered and gifted for that purpose.

## Responsibilities
The Champion of Wisdom is intended to serve as an inspiration to the Pilgrims of the faith and laity as to what it means to be wise, particularly in a military context. They are also charged with bearing and protecting the shield known as ''Measure''. Historically the bearers of ''Measure'' formed, along with the bearers of the other Pilgrims shield, the “Seven Pilgrims” band. 

## Powers
### Regalia of the Champion of Wisdom
The Champion of Wisdom bears ''Measure'', the unique Pilgrim's Shield. If the Champion of Wisdom loses their position, then the item must be given to the new Champion with all haste. The Champion is encouraged to take all appropriate precautions to keep this item safe, and is expected to do everything within their power to recover it if it is lost.

At present, ''Measure'' has been lost to the Empire. Even if it is located, until it is provided and becomes formal regalia, there is no legal obligation to provide the shield to the title-holder.

The most recent known location of ''Measure'' is in the hands of Zamashka, Prince of Votika, in the [[Principalities of Jarm]], having been [[Of_tribute|acquired from Tharim and the other "sovereign-lords of the Wasteland"]] after the Winter Equinox 379YE.

## Appointment
The Champion of Wisdom is chosen every Autumn Equinox by a [[judgement]] of [[appointment]] by the [[Assembly#The Virtue Assemblies|Assembly of Wisdom]].

Any Imperial citizen may hold this title. They can be revoked by the [[Assembly#General_Assembly|General Assembly]], the Wisdom Assembly, and the [[Assembly#Assembly_of_the_Nine|Assembly of the Nine]].



## History
The shield ''Measure'' was created by Ezkiah the Benefactor, greatest smith of the [[Highguard|Highborn]] along with six other shields. Each was gifted to a different hero, forming a company known as the “Seven Pilgrims”. 

''Measure'' was first carried by Sister Carmena the Peacemaker, whose efforts brought Dawn and the Marches from the brink of bloodshed during the notorious War of the Sisters crisis. Passed from Champion to Champion, or selected by the priests of Wisdom when this was not possible, it remained an enduring inspiration to the faithful of the Empire. 

At the battle of [[Reikos]] in 367 YE the Seven Pilgrims of the day charged an entire [[Druj]] army on their own, allowing the outmatched Imperial forces time to quit the field in good order. ''Measure'' was lost along with the other six shields.

Historically the Shield was passed from Champion to Champion; the Synod has ended this tradition through the creation of a formal title, following the example set by the [[Create_title_Champion_of_Courage|creation]] of the [[Champion of Courage]].
