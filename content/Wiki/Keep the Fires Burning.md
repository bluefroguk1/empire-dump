The Wolves in the wood cry lonely tears
Their hearts are cold with fear
They cannot feel the hearths' bright warmth
Tis hunger draws them near

Chorus: 
Keep the fires burning high
Keep your voices loud
Keep the cold from out your bones
Wychlova, sing proud

Snow falls deep and snow falls fast
'twill bury the tents and the gear
It spins and dances in the night
The drifts are piling near

Chorus

The winds howl cold and biting teeth
It tears at our cloaks and the furs
It pulls and drags at the screaming trees
And flings their branches far

Chorus

On a moonless night the clouds draw in
The stars are hidden from sight
Beyond the fire's warming glow
Wychlova, carry your light

Chorus

Deep in the trees comes a warning growl
And eyes aglow in the dark
The monsters prowling all around
Tis song that holds them back

Chorus

Out in the dark night a hunter's horn
The tearing of flesh and of bone
A clash of steel and a splash of blood
Hunters, we're calling you home

Chorus

As dawn's light comes, the blizzard ends
The camp is safe and calm
All the children fast asleep
Our song is nearly done

Last Chorus:
Let the embers warm our bread
Let our voices calm
The night has passed and the wolves are gone
Wychlova, safe from harm.
