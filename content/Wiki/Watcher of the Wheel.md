## Overview
Watcher of the Wheel is an [[Imperial title]] [[Construct Tower of the Wheel|announced]] by the [[Arcane Architect]] in Autumn 382YE. Unlike many similar sinecures, the Keeper receives not a bounty of crystal mana, but an amount of [[vis]].
## Responsibilities
The Watcher has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of [[vis]]. If the Tower were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Watcher to deal with those threats.
## Powers
### Vis
The Watcher of the Wheel gains custodianship of a [[sinecure]]. They receive an income of one portion each of [[Vis#Warm_Ashes|warm ashes]], [[Vis#Vital_Honey|vital honey]], [[Vis#Crystal_Fire|crystal fire]], and [[Vis#Heart.27s_Blood|heart's blood]] each season.
==Appointment== 
As with all titles created by the Arcane Architect, the appointment, replacement, or removal of the Watcher is made by the [[Declaration#Declaration_of_Candidacy|declaration of candidacy]] as part of a [[Conclave session]]. Any Imperial citizen may hold the title.

The Watcher of the Wheel serves until they are replaced by another magician using the Declaration of Candidacy. As a title in the Conclave, they cannot be [[Revocation|revoked]].

## Tower of the Watcher
In the northern woodlands of Madeiras, in Tassato, there is a tower overgrown with ivy. A solitary weirwood tree grows inside it, reaching up to the heavens, its branches protruding through the walls. According to some old tales, it was once owned by a troupe of enigmatic dramaturgists who engaged in dubious rites to win the approval of one or more of the Night eternals. 

The late Richard of Holberg [[Foggy_mountain_top#Watcher_of_the_Wheel|designed]] amendments to the structure that harness the powerful flows of mana through the area.
