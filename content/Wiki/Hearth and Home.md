Original song " Byla Cesta" trad. Moravian. Words by Daisy.

RECORDING of this song : [[Media:hearth-and-home.mp3]]


Springtime blossom scents the air with flowers
Summer sunlight brings long evening hours

Chorus:
O Varushka! O Varushka, never more I'll roam
In Varushka, in Varushka lies my hearth and home

Autumn forests ring with axe and song
Winter's beauty only for the strong

Chorus

In the night time, parting lovers weaving
Only [[Varushka culture and customs#Parting|braids]] and never tears when leaving

Chorus

Weeks go by, another year is turning
Turning homeward where my heart is yearning

Chorus
