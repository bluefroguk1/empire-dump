## Overview
The Iron Roundtower was constructed by [[Construct_Iron_Roundtower|announcement]] of the [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] during the Summer Solstice 383YE, following an [[opportunity]] presented during the [[The_honey_offering#Proposal:_Iron_Roundtower|Spring Equinox]] of the same year. Construction was completed shortly before the Autumn Equinox 383YE.

## Responsibilities
The Bargainer of the Iron Tower is responsible for ensuring good relations with the Varushkans who offer their mithril in trade. If the Iron Roundtower were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Bargainer to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[opportunity]] were to arise related to the Iron Roundtower, the Bargainer would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.

As a [[ministry]], the Bargainer can purchase quantities of [[mithril]] at a set price. The Bargainer spends their money and makes their choices during downtime from their character page. Money is removed from, and resources are placed into, the character's inventory when the downtime is processed.

## Appointment
This title is appointed during the Autumn Equinox each year. The Bargainer of the Iron Tower is appointed by citizens of Varushka who control [[mine|mines]] and [[forest|forests]] [[Resource#Personal_Resource|personal resources]]. The larger the holder an individual has, the more votes they can allocate in support to a candidate. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Only a Varushkan citizen may hold the title. They do not receive a seat on the Bourse. As a title appointed through the Bourse they cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
