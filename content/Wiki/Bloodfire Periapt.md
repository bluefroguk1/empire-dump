## Description
A Bloodfire Periapt most commonly is made as a green or red stone worn on a chain, although they are also worn as rings or bracelets. They are often marked with the rune [[Rhyv]] and [[Verys]]. Some [[Varushka|Varushkan]] and [[Wintermark|Winterfolk]] artisans mark these items with [[Irremais]], a rune associated with sacrifice - or shape the pendant stone in the form of a hanging blade.

These amulets grant the wearer a feverish, unnatural strength when they are stuck by envenomed attacks. Some fanatics have been known to intentionally envenom themselves to draw on the sick vitality these talismans offer, but doing so is an extremely risky proposal that has led to these items being christened ''Fool's Bargains''.

## Rules

* Effect: .While under the effect of [[Calls#VENOM|VENOM]], you gain three additional ranks of [[Combat skills#Endurance|endurance]]. You lose three hits from your current total if the VENOM is cured, or you lose this item.
* Materials: Crafting a Bloodfire Periapt requires eleven ingots of  [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]], seven ingots of [[Materials#Orichalcum|orichalcum]], three ingots of  [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]], and seven measures of  [[Materials#Beggar's Lye|beggar's lye]]. It takes one month to make one of these items.


Yisalto was his name, the son of a Riqueza ritual dancer and wandering naga poet, but he was never called anything but the Serpent.

They say he lived atop a pillar of brass amongst the cliffs of Kahraman, refusing to eat anything except the most venomous of birds, beasts and insects, drinking only from a fouled well. When the sweet horns of war sounded, the Serpent slithered down from his lair in the mountains and danced amongst the spear-points and axe blades of the enemy. Each poor soul that felt his caress knew their doom as his magic turned the blood in their veins to poison. The Serpent laughed to see the strong become weak at his merest touch, even as his own blood flowed thick and dark until it seemed that his flesh could never contain such vileness. 

But in the end the Serpent fell prey to a force more treacherous and poisonous than himself - love. As he slept his lover stole away the charmed necklace that let him draw strength from his venom, and the Serpent died, thrashing and foaming in agony like his many victims. 

His tower still stands, surrounded by the bones of the creatures that thought to make a meal of his remains...
