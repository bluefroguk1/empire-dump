Here is Caroline Herring's version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCu4Jd-5ZXQ


Hush a bye don't you cry
Hush a bye my pretty baby
When you wake you shall have
All the pretty little ponies

Blacks and bays, dapples and greys
Hush a bye my pretty baby
When you wake you shall have
All the pretty little ponies


NB The [[horse]] is now extinct in the Empire.
