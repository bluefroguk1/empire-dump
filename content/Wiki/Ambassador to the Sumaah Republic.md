After a [[Construct Sumaah embassy|false start]] in Winter 378YE, the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] eventually [[commission|commissioned]] an [[embassy]] for the Sumaah Republic in [[Construct Sumaah embassy II|Spring 379YE]]. The project was been dogged by problems, and not completed until shortly before the Spring equinox 380YE. This delay exacerbated [[Trade_winds#The_Sumaah_Republic|the growing fury of the Sumaah Republic]] towards the Empire, which culminated in a [[Price_of_prosperity#War_with_Sumaah|declaration of war]] by the Republic in late 379YE.

That declaration was rescinded during the Summer Solstice 382YE, but at the same time the Sumaah declared themselves the custodians of the Way and denounced Imperial claims to authority over the religion.
