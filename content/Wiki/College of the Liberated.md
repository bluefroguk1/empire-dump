## Overview
This sturdy college stands in [[Sarvos#Bocche|Trivento]], in the [[the League|League]] [[territory]] of [[Sarvos]]. It was initially constructed to help deal with an influx of freed [[orc]] slaves brought to the Empire from the [[Principalities of Jarm]]. Today, most of the students are young League citizens seeking to better their lot in life.

The college guides people toward [[Prosperity]] by providing education and apprenticeships to the poor and disadvantaged - and by doing so thereby increase the productivity of all [[business|businesses]] in Sarvos. There was some [[Construct_College_of_the_Liberated#Constitution|controversy]] around this project with regard to the legal status of the orc slaves, but that was quickly resolved by the magistrates. Both the college - and the originator of the scheme Duke Ferrero Sanguineo Rezia di Tassato of the Gilded Horn Carta - have received much praise from the Church of [[the Little Mother]] who have called for similar schemes in other parts of the Empire.

A significant majority of the orcs for whom the college was built - the slaves from Jarm - now live among the Imperial Orcs as part of their nation. They are referred to as the [[liberated]].

## History
The College was [[Commission|commissioned]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] in Winter 379YE to deal with an influx of [[orc|orcs]] from the [[Principalities of Jarm]]. In the  years since, most of the orc students who have passed through its doors have moved on, one way or another. Today, the college provides education and apprenticeships to the poor and disadvantaged of Sarvos. 

Of the three hundred or so freed slaves who came to the Empire from Jarm, only around a third still remain in Sarvos, Some still live in [[#Bocche|Trivento]], but most have been lured to the City of Masks itself. Despite their time at the college, many struggle to compete with professional League citizens who have enjoyed more education and greater opportunities. While some are able to hold jobs as assistants to shopkeepers, most have ended up as labourers of one type or another - farmhands, dockworkers, miners, drovers. There are even a very few nasty rumours that at least one old-style "fighting pit" has been reopened somewhere in Caricomare, with orc gladiators providing the main attraction as they did in the bad old days before the [[The Orc Rebellion|Orc revolt]].

Part of the problem has been caused by [[the sack of Sarvos]], a mere three months after work on the College was completed. The Jarmish orcs are often treated with suspicion by citizens of Sarvos, concerned that they may be more inclined to support the Grendel than their human benefactors. There seems to be little basis for this prejudice - after all, there were no College orcs ''in'' Sarvos during the time of the invasion - they were all still in Trivento. There have been a handful of violent incidents of violence aimed at the newcomers, but for the most part the prejudice is less obvious.

It is no surprise, then, that two-thirds of the orcs educated at the College have chosen to move elsewhere. Most take the long overland trip to [[Skarsind]], looking to find new lives for themselves. Ironically, they have little difficulty finding employment there. Many are more than happy to work in the mines the Imperial Orcs eschew, alongside the human miners who make up the majority of mineworkers in Skarsind. Others find the skills learned in their apprenticeship in the League to be rare among the Imperial Orcs, and settle into comfortable positions running or helping to run businesses - such as those associated with [[Skarsind#Southpine|Torfast Trading Post]]. College orcs settling in Skarsind invariably bond to the Imperial Orc egregore, and set about industriously building new lives for themselves and their families.

When Casimir Marcelino di Sarvos spoke in the [[Imperial Synod]] encouraging the people of Sarvos to show hospitality to the freed Jarmish slaves, but to be vigilant to the possibility of Grendel infiltrators, his words have polarised opinion somewhat. Those already predisposed to view the College orcs as citizens make more of an effort to help them improve their status in the League. Those already suspicious of the orcs point to the possibility of Grendel orcs among them, and grumble. Most people don't care one way or another of course - this is Sarvos and there are more important things to worry about - but discussion between the two opposed sides is becoming more heated.
