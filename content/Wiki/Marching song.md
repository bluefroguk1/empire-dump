RECORDING of this song : [[Media:varushkan-march.mp3]]

Melody-only version: [[Media:Marching_Song.wav]]



Storms of winter cannot shake us
As to war we go
Thirst and hunger never break us
Onward through the snow 

Home and hearth we leave behind us
As to war we go
Those we love and ties that bind us
Onward through the snow

Foul enchantments cannot charm us
As to war we go
Nor can curse or witchcraft harm us
Onward through the snow

At our footfall all shall fear us
As to war we go
Foes will quail to venture near us
Onward through the snow

If I fall upon the morrow
As to war we go
Raise a cup for me in sorrow
Onward through the snow

Though cruel death may yet divide us
As to war we go
Fallen heroes march beside us
Onward through the snow

Hail to those who went before us
As to war we go
Join me now in rousing chorus!
Onward through the snow
