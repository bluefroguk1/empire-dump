What you need to understand is
How very cold our land is
A beercoat here is not a luxury
All good Varushkans do it,
If it doesn't move then brew it
And if it does then hit it til it stops
And then go to it...

Without the dark and cold here
No one would have made much beer
Rotting grains and fungus? No thank you
You have to really need it
To smell it, mix and knead it
And still be able to stomach a pint
Tastes like you peed it...

Do you like the taste of honey?
Or do you think it's kind of funny?
The bees prefer to keep it in their comb
Guess what? There's a trick to it
But the honey, yes we brew it
And the sweetest, strongest booze we can 
produce
It's how you view it...
The potato is a tuber
In pies and stews it's uber
But surely its potential endeth there?
Oh my friend, you have learned nothing
Good Varushkans keep on stuffing
For the vodka vat takes almost anything
And ends all suff'ring...

In the forest we find berries
A good reason to care is
Nothing to do with the taste or smell
Okay, you can dye clothes up
But we'd much rather mash those up
If you leave it long enough, oh yes it's booze
All ready to sup...

I hear apples are quite tasty
But let's not be so hasty
This one looks a bit too small and sour
I bet that if we squish it,
Leave it lying where we'll mish it
Eventually it will be more fun
Still looks like pish it...

So animal or veg-e-tab-le,
Nice or not to taste
We'll make it into something that will get you 
off your face
I hope you've learned your lesson
Cos it's time to start the session
And if you need to ask whose round it is
Oh yes it i-is.
