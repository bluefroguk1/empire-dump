## The Lion, [[Rune]] of Might
''Affiliated with the [[Realm]] of [[Summer]]''
The strong arm, the numberless host, the storm against which there is no shelter, the shelter that no storm can breach, the fire that forges the strongest blade. At its basest level, [[Verys]] is the rune dealing with the application of strength, but it makes no moral assumptions about the manner of such use – beyond the assumption that it is good to exercise strength.
[[Verys]] is very much a rune of two faces.  One face is the strength that aids society; the strong smith at their forge, the sturdy battlement that holds back the enemy, the powerful army that keeps the peace or the learned sage that dispenses [[Wisdom|wisdom]] to all and sundry. It is power harnessed and channelled towards constructive ends. The other face is a brutal one, the simple naked application of force, generally in a mindlessly destructive way. It is strength without reason or [[Restraint|restraint]]; the horde that pillages all in its path, the siege weapon that batters and smashes all in its path, the bully who oppresses all before them, the clever jackanape that keeps others in bondage through application of the rules of society.
[[Verys]] is sometimes used to embody the idea that the great should command the weak, either by seeking its fealty or by crushing it completely. This also colours its interaction with other [[Runes|runes]]; those it cannot command it seeks to destroy. 
In [[Dawn]] it is used alongside [[Jotra]], [[Tykonus]] and [[Feresh]] to signify [[Glory]] – in this case the [[Glory|glory]] that comes from the exercise of strength and power. 
In some ancient rune sets, [[Verys]] and [[Kyrop]], the Rune of [[Weakness]] are represented by a single runestone, with the direction in which it is drawn and laid determining which meaning it takes on. 
### Using [[Verys]] in [[Magic|magic]]
As with the other Summer [[Runes|runes]], Verys is used in [[Magic|magic]] that enhances or supports. Unlike several other [[Runes|runes]], it grants strength and prowess directly rather than enhancing what is there. It has little patience for [[Weakness|weakness]], however, and can be dangerous to apply to those who are too weak to control the strength that flows through them.
### Crafting with Verys
Throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]], warriors and soldiers bear Verys as a touchstone. It appears on armour, weapons and shields, and is a common symbol worn as a tattoo or [[Brand|brand]].
