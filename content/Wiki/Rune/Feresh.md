## The Eagle, Rune of Majesty
''Affiliated with the [[Realm]] of Summer''
The golden rune, [[Feresh]] is the eagle surveying its domain and the stag atop the highest peak. It is the mark of greatness, of profound correctness that wells forth in nobility of form, deed and thought. It calls to all that is best both in the human spirit and in the natural world. It is also called the Rune of Beauty and the Rune of Splendour.   
Feresh is the monarch with no need of guards, the priest who sways the [[Congregation]] with her quiet presence, the Warrior who defeats their opponents with their [[Courage]] before battle is even joined. Feresh intensifies qualities, forces and energies and in this regard is sometimes called the Horn. It is also a rune that grants a measure of protection from outside influences, especially those which might cause doubt, confusion, shame or humility, and in this aspect is called the Helm. 
The danger of Feresh is that it does not create, it merely enhances what is already present. If it is marked on someone or something that is flawed, the flaw is magnified along with whatever other qualities are present. It becomes the strength that breaks the thing that is strong.
Feresh is used along with [[Jotra]], [[Tykonus]] and [[Verys]] to represent [[Glory]] by many Dawnish Magicians and crafters; here it represents Glory as a quality of the spirit. 
Sometimes referred to as the “Emperor Rune”, some pre-Imperial gold [[Currency]] carried its seal. Many Winterfolk leaders bear Feresh on an amulet or other piece of jewelery, but anyone who aSpires to greatness may look to the rune for inspiration. 
Feresh is also connected to the Imperial Virtue of [[Pride]], and is said to have a strong affiliation for the [[Changeling]] [[Lineage]].
### Using Feresh in [[Magic]]
Feresh is evoked with magic that enhances qualities in individuals, or is invoked to provide influence over others. It is also an intensifier, and is sometimes used to add additional power to another magical effect such as when raising a storm. Dawnish [[War]] Witches often evoke Feresh alongside the other Summer [[Runes]] when performing the [[Empower]] incantation.
### Crafting with Feresh
The Eagle is sometimes marked on helmets, or referred to circumspectly by helms shaped like the head of an eagle, or surmounted by eagle wings, it is considered to grant a measure of protection from fear, but also to empower the wearer with confidence and the ability to resist the harsh cruelties of war.
