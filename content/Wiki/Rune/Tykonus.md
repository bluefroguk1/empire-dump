## The [[Banner]], [[Rune]] of Victory
''Affiliated with the [[Realm]] of [[Summer]]''
The feasting hall that is home only to [[Heroes|heroes]] is hung with banners, the golden instant of consummation that burns itself into memory, the moment when you can hear  [[History|history]] urging you onwards in the fluttering of the pennants. [[Tykonus]] transcends mortal flesh, and becomes immortal â€“ a legend.
[[Tykonus]] cares not for morals, only that the battle is won. That said, it smiles upon those who win through great deeds that [[Will|will]] be remembered through the ages. An infamous [[General|general]] who cruelly puts their enemies to the flame embodies the meaning of this rune as much as a noble warrior that spares their enemies. What matters is the victory and the triumph; that you have won and that your enemies have lost. Mercy is not a matter for [[Tykonus]], but neither is cruelty.
It is the active counterpart of [[Jotra]], and the two are often evoked together simply because there is no victory without conflict. It is sometimes presented as the [[Mediator|mediator]] between [[Ull]] and [[Gralm]], representing that Victory comes from the tension between chance and destiny. 
Along with [[Feresh]], [[Jotra]] and [[Verys]], the Banner is used to represent [[Glory]] by many Dawnish magicians and crafters; here it represents the [[Glory]] that comes from overcoming an opponent and achieving one's goals despite opposition.
===Using [[Tykonus]] in [[Magic|magic]]=== 
[[Tykonus]] is used in [[Magic|magic]] that enhances and empowers, as well as in [[Magic|magic]] that contends against others. It is often evoked in large-scale [[Magic|magic]] where success is not assured. As with the other [[Runes|runes]] associated with Summer, it is often evoked while performing the [[Empower]] incantation.
### Crafting with Tykonus
The rune of victory is commonly worn on shields and (obviously) worked into the hems of banners and surcoats. A gift given to the victor in a contest of skill or arms often bears the rune as part of its decoration.

When dragged to battle in service to the grey little bean-counters, it serves like a whipped dog, always looking for a way to strike out and [[Ruin|ruin]] its master's aims.  If you do not seek to win with some style, then you may take victory, but you [[Will|will]] never take the truer victory of Tykonus, for your dry tales [[Will|will]] shiver no spines and inflame no passions.  Who [[Will|will]] remember you when you are [[Gone|gone]]?  True victory is immortal.
