## The Torrent, Rune of Storms and Disaster
''Affiliated with the [[Realm]] of Spring''
[[Mawrig]] represents the raw, unbridled, uncontrolled chaos of nature. It is tenacious and uncaring, like the plants that crack paving slabs apart in a city, or the river that bursts its banks and washes away a village as it quests for a new route to the sea. It is the power of the Storm and brings Ruination to the works of humankind.
Anything which is out of the control of mortals comes under Mawrig’s influence; as the Talons it is symbolic of many dangerous creatures that live in the wild places, especially the vicious insect horrors that surface from time to time in Navarri territory. Some vates use Mawrig when they wish to refer to The [[The Vallorn]], claiming that it encompasses the central nature of that vegetable horror.
In [[Highguard]], [[The League]], and [[Urizen]], the rune Mawrig represents Disaster – Curses that target buildings often evoke this rune and it is seen as a particularly ill omen. Among the [[Navarr]], the Winterfolk and the Varushkans it often represents circumstances that sweep the weak and unprepared before them; it is seen as an amoral rather than sinister rune that can teach lessons in flexibility and cleverness.
### Using Mawrig in [[Magic]]
Mawrig is commonly evoked during [[Rituals]] that are intended to unleash natural forces such as storms or floods, but it is also used with rituals that require a lot of raw energy. Mawrig is rarely used by itself, as to do so is to release magical energy without shape or form. The energies that come forth so easily are unpredictable and can slip from the grasp of an inexperienced practitioner. 
### Crafting with Mawrig
Mawrig is rarely inscribed on crafted items; such objects have a tendency to be difficult to control or wield, and a tendency to break. It is often inscribed on something that is to be destroyed; [[On the Wall]] of a condemned building in the League, or on a big rock that a Marcher Farmer intends to break up. For the same reason it is [[Painted]] or carved into catapult stones shortly before they are launched; superstition suggests that inscribing the rune Early increases the likelihood that the stone will miss its target and inflict daMage on the wrong side.
A Warrior who bears Mawrig on their weapon or shield is given a wide berth by the wise, as they are likely to [[Fight]] with chaotic fury.
