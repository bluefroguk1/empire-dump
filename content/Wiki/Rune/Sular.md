## The Ship, [[Rune]] of Discovery
''Affiliated with the [[Realm]] of [[Day]]''
[[Sular]] is the Ship, and is the counterpart of [[Ophis]], Rune of Revelation. It represents the questing spirit, the drive to learn and to expand oneâ€™s knowledge. It is the drive to explore, and to find things. It is sometimes called the Finder of Ways, and is often sewn into the sails of ships that must travel out of sight of land. It is sometimes used as a rune to help those who are lost, either literally or metaphorically, to get back on course.
Discovery never comes without effort; unlike the flash of inspiration that leads to revelation, [[Sular]] works best when combined with hard work. It is the rune of prognostication, which extrapolates from known facts to uncover truth. During divination, Sular is sometimes used to mitigate the negative effects of [[Ophis]]. The Rune of Revelation represents the truth or fact that is sought, while Sular serves as an intermediary that helps to [[Guide|guide]] the power of the [[Magic|magic]].
Highborn magicians say that Sular was the name of the ship that carried [[Atun]] away from Pharos, while some [[Guerra]] claim that their founder used a dowsing pendulum marked with this rune to lead the [[Freeborn]] to their new homeland. In [[Varushka]] it is common to see Sular embroidered into gifts given during a Parting, in the hope that the rune [[Will|will]] help guide a loved one safely home again.
### Using Sular in [[Magic|magic]]
Sular is evoked with magic that finds things, scries locations or prognosticates from gathered information. It is a common rune to use when casting [[Detect Magic]].
### Crafting with Sular
This rune is popular with scholars who often wear it on a medallion or ring, or even have it as a tattoo. Sailmakers and shipwrights use it when building seagoing vessels to help guide vessels safely home, and for the same reason may be inscribed on a gift given to a loved one who must spend an extended period of time away from home.
