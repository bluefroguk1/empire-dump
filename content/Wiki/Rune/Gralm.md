## The [[Crossroads]], [[Rune]] of Destiny
[[Gralm]] is the [[Mystic|mystic]] counterpart of [[Ull]] the rune of chance. Unlike many other [[Runes|runes]] it does not have an association with one of the [[Realms|realms]] of [[Magic|magic]]. An esoteric rune, it avoids simple classification. In conjunction with [[Ull]], it represents the concept of skein. It represents choices, and the ability to make the vital choices that ultimately define the destiny of the individual.
The Rune of the [[Crossroads]] represents [[The Key|the key]] decisions that define a life, the decisions where a refusal to make a choice is still a decision. It recognises that while a person does not have control over the universe, or the situations it throws at them, they have ultimate control over their own decisions. It is sometimes called the Hero Rune as a consequence, and an individual whose choices have wide-reaching consequences is often said to have ''walked the road of [[Gralm]]''.
Some [[Mystics|mystics]] use the rune of destiny to represent the labyrinth of ages. These mystics claim that death is the ultimate destiny of all mortals, but the labyrinth represents an ultimate choice. These mystics claim that the soul chooses what form to be reborn in. Some even go so far as to claim that the labyrinth is in fact the ''mortal'' world, and that the path the individual traces through that world is the true purpose of existence.
### Using Gralm in [[Magic|magic]]
Gralm is rarely used in magic; it is most commonly used in enchantments designed to [[Empower|empower]] an individual with great power.
===Crafting with Gralm=== 
Gralm is often worked into items that provide heroic abilities, and may be evoked with the [[Empower]] incantation,
The paths fork and divide. With each step you take through the labyrinth, you make a choice; and every choice determines future paths. However, at the end of a lifetime of walking you might look back, and see only one path stretching out behind you; or look ahead, and see only darkness.
