### The Seedpod, [[Rune]] of Fertility
''Affiliated with the [[Realm]] of [[Spring]]''
[[Bravash]] is the Seedpod, and represents nature in uncounted variety; it represents the drive to procreate and the cycle of growth from seed to tree to fruit to seed again. It is symbolic of lifeâ€™s ability to beget life in its own image as well as the unthinking and unending urge to create new life in a thousand different forms. It is strongly affiliated with agriculture; when evoked to enhance the fertility and abundance of a field it is called the Plough. 
It is also commonly called the Goat, representing the savagery of the natural world. It is the instinct to drive off competitors, the cruelty of nature and the drive to spread and occupy every niche. Combined with [[Hirmok]] the Scythe, the [[Autumn]] Rune of Dominion, it represents domesticated beasts whose fertility serves their human masters. 
This rune has special significance in [[The Marches]]. Farmers might evoke it as they sow seed, and it is usually inscribed on the standing stones that dot the fertile countryside. In [[Highguard]] [[Bravash]] is sometimes associated with the propagation of [[The Way|the Way]] of Virtue, and in [[Urizen]] and [[Navarr]] with the spread of ideas, recognizing the chaotic way that thought spreads and develops over time.
### Using Bravash in [[Magic|magic]]
Bravash is evoked with [[Magic|magic]] that causes living things to become fruitful. It can also be used to enhance the [[General|general]] health and vitality of a living person or natural place. It is often used with magic that is intended to spread in a predictable fashion, or that is intended to encourage wild growth. 
### Crafting with Bravash
Couples throughout [[The Empire|the Empire]] inscribe the rune of Bravash on their beds, either upright or inverted, depending on whether or not they wish for a child (although relying on the rune alone is a risky proposition at best). It is also inscribed on [[Farm|farm]] tools, or over the lintels of animal pens for the same reason. Many apothecaries use the rune to mark preparations that are intended to enhance or restore virility or vitality, or occasionally inverted to signify preparations that cause lethargy or prevent conception.
