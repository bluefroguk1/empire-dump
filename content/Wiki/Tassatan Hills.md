## Overview
The Tassatan Hills are located the hills about [[Tassato#Tassato_Mestra|Tassato Mestra]], in [[the League]] [[territory]] of [[Tassato]]. Custodianship of the Tassatan Hills grants an [[Imperial title]]; a seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]; and a seasonal bounty of valuable [[ilium]].

The Hills were established by [[Exploit Tassatan Hills|motion of the Imperial Senate]] at the Winter Solstice 384YE, following the [[Light_upon_the_water#The_Good_News|plans]] of Gemma Stewart of Tassato

## The Bourse Seat
### Responsibilities
The Seat has no particular responsibilities; they simply receive a bounty of ilium which is theirs to do with as they will. If the Tassatan Hills were to be threatened in any way, it would be the responsibility of the Seat to deal with those threats. Likewise, if any particular [[opportunity]] were to arise related to the Tassatan Hills, the Seat would expect to be consulted as to how that opportunity might be resolved.
### Powers
### Seat on the Bourse
Custodianship of the Tassatan Hills comes with a seat on the Imperial Bourse. For the most part, this Seat comes with no additional responsibilities. It is an Imperial title that grants the right to participate on the rare occasion when the Imperial Bourse as a body is required to make a decision.
### Bounty of ilium
The Seat has control of a source of ilium which they receive directly. They can dispense this resource as they choose. Production is 6 rings of ilium every season.
### Appointment
As with all ilium Bourse seats, the holder of the title is determined during the Spring Equinox. Control of the Tassatan Hills is assigned to whichever League candidate receives the most support from League [[business]] owners via the [[Tally of the Votes]]. The voting is handled by the civil servants in the Bourse. 

Custodianship of the Tassatan Hills is retained for a year, or until the citizen holding the seat dies, or steps down. An Imperial Bourse seat cannot be [[revocation|revoked]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
