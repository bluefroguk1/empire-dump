## Description

A ''troubadour's tunic'', ''templar's cuculla'', or a ''sutannir's coat'' (in [[Dawn]], [[Highguard]], and [[The Brass Coast]] respectively) is an ornamented priestly garment that helps the wearer connect with their inner reserves of passion and personal power. Both [[Navarr]] and [[Varushka|Varushkan]] priests favour a more subdued coat, with a brightly coloured and decorated interior - not because they are modest, or afraid of calling attention to themselves, but because it allows them to move among the people unremarked until it is time for them to take action. Regardless of form, this vestment is heavily reinforced with pieces of [[Materials#Dragonbone|dragonbone]], which help to connect the priest to their own reserves of inner strength.

The vestment generally appeals to two distinct priestly paths. More martial priests wear it beneath their armour when they take the battlefield, sometimes in conjunction with a weapon such as an [[Apprentice's Blade]], [[Thresher's Cudgel]], or [[Butcher's Cleaver]]. Others draw on the power it offers to help them endure dangerous [[roleplaying effects|urges]] or to [[Heroic skills#Get It Together|inspire]] and [[Heroic skills#Stay With Me|protect]] their allies.

As with many such [[magic items]] intended for the use of priests, a Troubadours Tunic is often [[hallow|hallowed]] to over additional spiritual strength to the wearer. Common choices include [[Auras of Prosperity#Hallowing of the Shepherd|Hallowing of the Shepherd]], the [[Auras of Courage#Hallowing of Isaella's Resolve|Hallowing of Isaella's Resolve]] or [[Auras of Courage#Hallowing of Ashwine's Rose|Ashwine's Rose]], or the [[Auras of Vigilance#Hallowing of the Unconquered|Hallowing of the Unconquered]].
