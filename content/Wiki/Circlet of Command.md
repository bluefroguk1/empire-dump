## Description
A Circlet of Command is sometimes called a ''Serjeant's Helm'' or a ''Barracker's Ring'' depending on the form it takes. Usually formed of beaten [[Materials#Weltsilver|weltsilver]] alloyed with  [[Materials#Common metals|silver]], [[mithril]], or iron, it is often inlaid with [[Materials#Green Iron|green iron]]. In [[Dawn]] and [[Urizen]] it is often made in the form of a chain or net of weltsilver and green iron, secured at the temples. In the [[The Marches|Marches]] and [[Varushka]] it is as likely to be a sturdy open-faced helmet made of green steel, with weltsilver decoration. Either way, it is sought after by serjeants, captains, and martially inclined priests. It grants strength to the words of encouragement spoken - or more commonly, shouted or barked - at injured soldiers to help keep their fighting spirit strong.

Some legends attribute the very first Circlet of Command to the [[Signs_of_the_paragon_and_exemplar|paragon]] of [[Courage]] [[Korl]], who discovered the secrets of metal-working deep beneath the earth. It is said that he wore a twist of metal about his arm to remind others that with bravery anything could be accomplished and that this reminder would give his fellows fresh strength to battle on against the monsters plaguing their land. A Circlet of Command crafted as an armband is often called ''Korlâ€™s Crown.''
