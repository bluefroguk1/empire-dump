### Constitution
It is possible for [[The Senate|the Senate]] to grant the [[High Exorcist]] the right to vote on [[The Military|the Military]] Council - doing so would automatically allow the holder of the title to be present throughout the a Military [[Council session]] and to speak freely. The [[Warmage]] operates in such a way at present. However this would be a substantive change to the working of [[The Empire|the Empire]], so would require the approval of [[The Throne]].
The Constitutional Scholars wish to point out that if [[The Synod|the Synod]] elect a [[High Exorcist]] who has control of a [[Congregation]], then the [[High Exorcist]] [[Will|will]] automatically benefit from the Right of [[Witness]], and cannot then be excluded from a Military [[Council session]]. Moreover the holder of the title is welcome to request permission to speak and can do so at the sufferance of the Council. The Adjutants appointed by each [[General]] operate in such a way at present.
It was initially ruled that it was not possible to give the High Exorcist the Power of Address in the [[Imperial Military Council]]. This Power of Address gives the holder the right to address the [[Senate]] ([[Conclave]] members have a similar power for [[The Conclave|the Conclave]]), but there is no equivalent power in the Military Council and the structure of the Military Council sessions does not allow for citizens to make addresses. Further examination of this decision led to its reversal in 378YE.
