### Constitution
A motion that is vetoed by the [[Imperial Synod]] would not normally be eligible to be raised again at that Summit. However this rule exists to ensure that the [[Senate]] are not able to circumvent the oversight of the [[Synod]]. In this situation, where it is clear that the Senate wished to take account of the views of the Synod and time was pressing, it is reasonable for the motion to be raised again.
