Return all Imperial armies to fUll strength with reinforcement to be directed by Military Council.
''Proposed by [[Hahnmark]], seconded by [[Bregasland]].''
### Overview
* Return all Imperial armies to full strength with reinforcement to be directed by Military Council
* Passed unanimously
### Date
* Passed Winter 376YE (Easter 2013)
### [[Cost]]
* None
### Legal Ramifications
* The Senate has not created a position with the authority, responsibility or budget to achieve this task
The civil service opinion is that the Senate could have chosen to create an Imperial position with the responsibility and legal authority to reinforce the Imperial armies. The position could have been granted a stipend. 
Without the creation of an Imperial position, this motion has no legal implications. It is simply a statement of intent.
