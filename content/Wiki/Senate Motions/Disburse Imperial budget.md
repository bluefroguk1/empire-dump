Any excess Senate budget at the end of a festival be divided equally between the Military Council and the Conclave for the betterment of the Empire.
''Proposed by Volodmartz, seconded by Redoubt.''
### Overview
* Any excess Senate budget at the end of a festival be divided equally between the [[Military Council]] and the [[Conclave]].
* Passed with 10 votes against
### Date
* Passed Winter 376YE (Easter 2013).
### Cost
* All remaining budget
Any money left over at the end of an event is split 50/50. One sixth goes to each Archmage vault I think, and the remaining cash is passed to the Military Council civil service until allocated by Council vote.
### Legal Ramification
The Senate cannot force the Conclave or the Military Council to reveal how the money is spent. The money, once given to the other houses, is theirs to do with as they will; the Senate surrenders up all claim to how it's spent or what is done with it.
Money given to the Conclave is added to the vaults of the [[Archmage|archmages]].
### Campaign Outcome
* Permanent allocation of budget created
Imperial civil servants will continue to distribute the Senate budget according to this system until instructed by a [[Senate motion]] to stop.
Development: The disbursement was [[Revoke fund disbursement|abrogated]] during Summer 377YE.
