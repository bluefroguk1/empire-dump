__NOTOC__
To revise the Imperial Title “High Bard of the Empire” that was established in Spring 381 and appointed by the Assembly of Nine during the same season. As a result of [[Scrutiny]] by the Civil Service it has been determined that Right of Address may not be afforded to an Imperial Title without significant legal power or stipend and in order to pass the motion as presented during spring 381 the senate would need to append a minimum stipend of 1 Throne per season to afford right of Address to the High bard. I therefore propose this amendment to resolve the matter. “Set a seasonal stipend for the office of High Bard, amount to be determined on the Senate Floor.” 
Proposed by Weirwater, Seconded by Semmerholm.
