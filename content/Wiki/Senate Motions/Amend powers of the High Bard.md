__NOTOC__
To revise the [[Imperial Title]] “[[High Bard of the Empire]]” that was established in [[Spring]] 381 and appointed by the [[Assembly]] of Nine during the same season. As a result of [[Scrutiny]] by the Civil Service it has been determined that Right of Address may not be afforded to an [[Imperial Title]] without significant legal power or stipend and in order to pass the motion as presented during spring 381 [[The Senate|the senate]] would need to append a minimum stipend of 1 [[Throne]] per season to afford right of Address to the High bard. I therefore propose this amendment to resolve the matter. “Set a seasonal stipend for the office of High Bard, amount to be determined on the [[Senate]] Floor.” 
Proposed by [[Weirwater]], Seconded by [[Semmerholm]].
