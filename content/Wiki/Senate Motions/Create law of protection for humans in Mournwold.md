__NOTOC__
Humans of the Mourn (excluding the [[Feni]]) are hereby afforded fUll protection under law.
Proposed by [[Mitwold]], Seconded by [[Morrow]].
### Overview
* Passed
### Date
* Summer 381YE
### Campaign Outcome
* Humans of the Mourn who are not Feni will receive legal protection as if they were a foreigner.
### Constitution
* It is noted by the court that there are a number of humans Fighting for the [[Jotun]] in the Mourn. This causes a legal contradiction in that those with whom [[The Empire]] is at [[War]] ordinarily have no legal protection. In practice if humans line up in battle against the Empire imperial soldiers will normally be protected by the law of self-defence. However it should be noted that this defence involves a "reasonableness" test which now potentially places the conduct of soldiers under the [[Scrutiny]] of the magistrates. Furthermore there may be other, far less clear cut, situations that may arise during the Mourn campaign.
*The use of the phrase "Humans of the Mourn" means that [[Barbarian]] humans whose homes are outside the Mourn wouldn't be given legal protection but humans living in the Mourn would (even if they were outside of the Mourn).
