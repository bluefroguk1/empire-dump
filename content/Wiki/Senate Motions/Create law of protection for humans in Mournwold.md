__NOTOC__
Humans of the Mourn (excluding the [[Feni]]) are hereby afforded full protection under [[Law|law]].
Proposed by [[Mitwold]], Seconded by [[Morrow]].
### Overview
* Passed
### Date
* [[Summer]] 381YE
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* Humans of the Mourn who are not [[Feni]] [[Will|will]] receive legal protection as if they were a foreigner.
### Constitution
* It is noted by the court that there are a number of humans fighting for the [[Jotun]] in the Mourn. This causes a legal contradiction in that those with whom [[The Empire|the Empire]] is at [[War|war]] ordinarily have no legal protection. In practice if humans line up in battle against [[The Empire|the Empire]] imperial soldiers [[Will|will]] normally be protected by [[The Law|the law]] of self-defence. However it should be noted that this defence involves a "reasonableness" test which now potentially places the [[Conduct|conduct]] of soldiers under the [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] of the [[Magistrates|magistrates]]. Furthermore there may be other, far less clear cut, situations that may arise during the Mourn campaign.
*The use of the phrase "Humans of the Mourn" means that [[Barbarian|barbarian]] humans whose homes are outside the Mourn wouldn't be given legal protection but humans living in the Mourn would (even if they were outside of the Mourn).
