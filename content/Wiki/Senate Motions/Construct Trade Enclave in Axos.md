__NOTOC__
Raise a motion to construct a trade enclave in [[Axos]] to trade with [[Skoura]] in minor [[Materials|materials]]. This would create the [[Imperial Title|imperial title]] ‘[[Merchant to Skoura]]’ to oversee the enclave. Appointed by the senators of [[Urizen]]. The enclave functions as a [[Ministry|ministry]]. No upkeep is required. No [[Senate|senate]] or civilian [[Commission|commission]] [[Will|will]] be required—constructed in [[Axos]] by Axou. Self-funded. This is the first [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to engage with [[Skoura]], who have no direct border with [[The Empire|the Empire]].
''Proposed by [[Morrow]], seconded by [[Reikos]].''

## [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* Once completed this [[Commission|commission]] [[Will|will]] be overseen by the title [[Merchant to Skoura]].
* This commission has not been successful. The Axou were under the impression [[The Empire|the Empire]] would arrange this commission and be responsible for building this trading enclave - they have not set any resources aside to oversee the construction.
* As there appears to have been a misunderstanding, the civil service intends to present an [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]] at the beginning of the [[Winter]] Solstice clarifying if [[The Senate|the Senate]] wishes to go ahead with the enclave. If they do, then it will count against the commissions available during that season but will not require another [[Senate motion]].
*The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to go ahead with the construction during the first [[Senate session|senate session]] of the Winter Solstice 383YE.
## Constitution
The Constitutional Court note that the civil service identified that the well worn path for appointing this trade [[Ministry]] was [[Appointment|appointment]] through the [[Imperial Bourse]]. They have not struck the [[Appointment|appointment]] by senators down as unconstitutional, but are setting time aside to review the principle of senatorial appointment especially as it related to ministries.
