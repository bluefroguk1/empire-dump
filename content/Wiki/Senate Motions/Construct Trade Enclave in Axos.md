__NOTOC__
Raise a motion to construct a trade enclave in [[Axos]] to trade with [[Skoura]] in minor [[Materials]]. This would create the [[Imperial Title]] ‘[[Merchant to Skoura]]’ to oversee the enclave. Appointed by the Senators of [[Urizen]]. The enclave functions as a [[Ministry]]. No upkeep is required. No senate or civilian [[Commission]] will be required—constructed in Axos by Axou. Self-funded. This is the first [[Opportunity]] to engage with Skoura, who have no direct border with [[The Empire]].
''Proposed by [[Morrow]], seconded by [[Reikos]].''
## Outcome
* Construct a trade enclave in Axos to establish trade with Skoura
* Passed (but see below under Campaign Outcome)
## Date
* Autumn 383YE
## [[Cost]]
* Non-standard costs apply
* 12 wains of [[Mithril]]

## Campaign Outcome
* Once completed this commission will be overseen by the title Merchant to Skoura.
* This commission has not been successful. The Axou were under the impression the Empire would arrange this commission and be responsible for building this trading enclave - they have not set any resources aside to oversee the construction.
* As there appears to have been a misunderstanding, the civil service intends to present an administrative motion at the beginning of the Winter Solstice clarifying if the Senate wishes to go ahead with the enclave. If they do, then it will count against the commissions available during that season but will not require another [[Senate motion]].
*The [[Imperial Senate]] voted to go ahead with the construction during the first [[Senate session]] of the Winter Solstice 383YE.
## Constitution
The Constitutional Court note that the civil service identified that the well worn path for appointing this trade Ministry was [[Appointment]] through the [[Imperial Bourse]]. They have not struck the appointment by senators down as unconstitutional, but are setting time aside to review the principle of senatorial appointment especially as it related to ministries.
