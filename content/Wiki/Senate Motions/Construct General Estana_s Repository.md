__NOTOC__
That we construct a grand library of Contracts, to be called [[General]] Estana's Repository, in the town of Oran, [[Feroz]].
This [[Folly|folly]] [[Will|will]] use one wain of [[White granite|white granite]], and [[Will|will]] be dedicated to the [[Eternal]] [[Callidus]], in payment for which, his heralds [[Will|will]] assist the [[Hakima]] with the codification of [[Autumn]] [[Rituals]].
Note that while we are seeking permission to build now, we [[Will|will]] not commence construction until we have a signed contract with the [[Eternal]], or one of his heralds.
Approved by the [[Civilian Commissioner]] of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]]
### Overview
* A [[Folly|folly]] in [[Feroz]] dedicated to the [[Eternal]] [[Callidus]]
* This motion was approved by the [[Civilian Commissioner]] of [[The Brass Coast]] using the legal power to [[Commission|commission]] constructions delegated to them by [[The Senate|the Senate]].
### Date
* [[Summer]] 380YE
### [[Cost]]
* 1 wain of [[White granite|white granite]]
* 2 crowns in labour costs
* 3 months to construct
### Progress
### Summer 381 YE
* This [[Commission|commission]] has lapsed
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* At this time, there appears to have been no signed contract and so work has not begun.
### Constitution
* There are concerns with this [[Commission]]. One of the limitations on a [[Civilian Commissioner]] is that "A [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] cannot [[Commission|commission]] anything that requires an upkeep" and there is no reference to upkeep in this announcement. A [[College of Magic]] has significant upkeep costs for [[The Empire|the Empire]].
* A [[Folly|folly]] cannot result in an upkeep for [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Should this [[Commission|commission]] appear to be creating something that required an upkeep, work would cease and direction from the [[Imperial Senate]] would be sought.
