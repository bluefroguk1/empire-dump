__NOTOC__
 I, Sagua i'Ezmara [[Master of the Koboldi]], will be building a glorious statue celebrating the victories in [[Semmerholm]], [[Ossium]] and the wider Empire achieved alongside the [[Knights of Glory]] and to honour our long standing relationship with [[Eleonaris]]. This has been explicitly requested by the Conclave as a matter of urgency. It will be placed at the Semmeholm end of the Golden Causeway, where those who cross it can be best appreciate it. It will then be the decision of the senate to cede the [[Folly]] or retain ownership. As the master of the Koboldi will be busy installing the Runic Hearth of [[Adamant]] the responsibility for Warm Dawnish hospitality of the koboldi will be assumed by Amica Peddler, [[Proxy]] [[Senator]] of Semmerholm.
