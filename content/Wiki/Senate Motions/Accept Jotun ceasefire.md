Title: Accept Jotun ceasefire
aliases:
- Accept_Jotun_ceasefire
---
To accept the Jotun offer of a two year ceasefire during which the Jotun and the Empire will not make war on each other.
''Proposed by Upwold, seconded by Mitwold.'' 
### Overview
* Agree to a two-year ceasefire with the [[Jotun]] orcs.
* The ceasefire runs from the beginning of the Spring Equinox 377YE until the beginning of the Spring Equinox 379YE.
* Passed by 27 votes to 0.
### Date
* Passed Summer 377 YE (Event Three 2013).
### Cost
* None
### Campaign Outcome
The ceasefire prohibits [[Imperial armies]] from entering territories claimed by the Jotun, including [[Liathaven]] and [[Mournwold]]. [[Jotun]] campaign armies in turn will not enter any Imperial territory.
At the Spring Equinox 378YE, the senate voted to accept a [[Extension of Jotun Ceasefire|proposed extension]] of the treaty which will now end at the start of the Spring Equinox 380YE.
During the Summer Solstice 379YE, the senate voted to [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Abrogation|abrogate]] the ceasefire early, to allow them to [[Accept Lasambrian treaty|provide military aid to the Lasambrian orcs]] against the Jotun.
### Notes
Subsidiary motions to outlaw [[Military unit#Production|raiding]] on the Jotun during the ceasefire, and to declare the Jotun foreigners for the duration, were proposed and defeated.
