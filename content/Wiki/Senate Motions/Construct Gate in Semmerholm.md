__NOTOC__
To rebuild the [[Fortification]] known as ‘The Gate’ in [[Semmerholm]] by accepting the offer of the [[Eternal]] [[Adamant]] to rebuild and make the Gate Unbreakable. This endeavour is self-funded and is not in need of an Imperial Surveyor.Proposed by Semmerholm, seconded by [[Holberg]].

* Passed
## Date
* Winter 381YE
## [[Cost]]

* 12 months to complete
* Upkeep: 18 Thrones 
* Does not count against the Senate limit on number of Commissions
## PrOgress
* 40 wains of white granite provided by Lorenzo “La Volpe” MacelLiao von [[Temeschwar]] after Winter Solstice 381YE.

* 32 wains of White granite provided by Lorenzo “La Volpe” Macelliao von Temeschwar after Winter Solstice 382YE.
* Final wains provided by overly enthusiastic ''koboldi'' who were then told off by Adamant for being profligate (but they still celebrated the project being complete, bless their little cotton socks)

* This construction may run into problems if Adamant is subject to enmity by the [[Imperial Conclave]]
