__NOTOC__
 To sell through the bourse the naming rights to the Sinkhole.
Proposed by the Dean of the Academy, Seconded by Volodmartz.
### Overview
* This motion was to sell through the bourse the naming rights to the Sinkhole
* Passed
### Date
* Summer 381YE
### Campaign Outcome
* The right to name the sinkhole that [[Rocks and gravel|recently opened]] in the north-western empire will be auctioned at the Autumn Equinox to the highest bidder.
### Constitution
* The Constitutional Court cautions that while the citizen who buys the right to name the sinkhole can give it whatever name they see fit, they have no authority to enforce the use of that name. The local citizens who suffered tragic losses as a result of the sinkhole opening are unlikely to embrace a comedic or inappropriate name.
