__NOTOC__
To make membership and aiding of the Hand of Dumon illegal, and to denounce this cabal of heretics.
## Overview
* The motion creates a law [[List of Criminal Offences#Crimes of Position|making it illegal]] to be a member of, or offer aid to, the Hand of Dumon.
* The Hand of Dumon is an [[Iron Confederacy]] conspiracy of magicians dedicated to the so-called dark god of the [[Suranni pantheon]]. They are not believed to be active within the Empire.
* Passed
## Date
* Spring 384YE.
## Outcome
* The Hand of Dumon is outlawed, as is offering aid to the organisation.
* Magistrate Karkovich advises that  the magistrates will treat this crime as being on par with membership of the [[Vyig]] rather than a more serious crime such as treason. Someone found guilty of being a member of the group, or offering aid to it, is likely to receive a fine rather than be executed (unless of course other more serious crimes come to light while investigating the case). Furthermore, [[Religious crime#Heresy|heresy]] is a matter for the [[Imperial Synod]] to determine, and so without a [[Judgement]] of [[Sanction#Condemnation|condemnation]] from the Synod that element will not be considered during criminal trials.
