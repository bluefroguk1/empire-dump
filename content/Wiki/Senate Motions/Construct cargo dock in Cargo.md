__NOTOC__
### Overview

* Passed
### Date
* [[Winter]] 380YE
### [[Cost]]
* 10 White Granite and 40 [[Weirwood]]
* Labour: 12 Thrones 4 Crowns 
* Time: 3 months
### Progress
* 40 [[Weirwood]], 10 White Granite and 12 Thrones, 4 crowns provided by Thanmir Hrafn after the [[Summer]] Solstice 381YE.
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* There are necessary details missing from this motion, [[Senator]] [[Madruga]] may decide on these.
* Completion of the docks creates the title Bewaarder van het Vandersaar dok
* When complete the docks [[Will|will]] create an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that [[Will|will]] function as a [[Ministry]], but allow the purchase of white granite from the Sarcophan Delves. The agreed rate is:
** 32 crowns each wain for the first 8 wains
** 29 crowns each wain for the second 8 wains
** 26 crowns each wain for the last 8 wains
* The well worn path for appointing the title associated with these docks you be as an Imperial or National title appointed through [[The Bourse|the Bourse]]
* As a ministry, these docks do not have an upkeep - the suggestion that they did was in error.
