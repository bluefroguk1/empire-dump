__NOTOC__
Introduce Imperial Wayleaves
To create a right to build known as an Imperial Wayleave.
This conveys the right to announce the construction of one [[Sinecure|sinecure]], [[Ministry|ministry]], [[Great work|great work]] to the citizen who purchase the wayleave.
An Imperial Wayleave may only be used in the season after it's purchased.
Create an additional [[Bourse]] auction each season. Proceeds go to Imperial budget.
Holder must use a wayleave in [[The Senate|the senate]] by announcement.
Three wayleaves [[Will|will]] be sold in each season.
Civil Service [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] required.
Proposed by [[Kahraman]], Seconded by [[Sarvos]]
### Overview
* Passed
* Create three Imperial titles [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] by the [[Imperial Senate]] that are appointed through Bourse auction
### Date
* [[Winter]] 380YE
### Constitution
* Each Wayleave must be an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] subject to all the normal rules for an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]]
* It is possible for this proposed [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] to have a term of a single summit
* The [[Commission|commission]] would have to be announced at the same summit that the title was auctioned
* The number of commissions available to the [[Senate]] would be reduced in advance by the number of Wayleaves auctioned
It is not possible to vest the powers of the state in a document that is auctioned - they must be an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that is held. The constitution demands that no Imperial citizen hold two titles at once - allowing documents to carry powers of state would create the potential for an individual to effectively circumvent this limitation. The closest comparable situation is the favour of [[The Throne]] - a highly complex and constitutionally challenging arrangement.
The constitutionally valid way to achieve the closest outcome that the court can identify is to auction one or more Imperial titles through [[The Bourse|the Bourse]] each summit. These titles would last for the duration of the summit - and would allow the appointed citizen to announce a single [[Commission|commission]] in the Senate at that summit. They would be subject to all the normal rules for Imperial titles.
The number of Imperial Commissions would be reduced by the number of titles being auctioned through the Bourse, to prevent [[The Empire|the Empire]] defaulting on its contract. The civil service are not confident of being able to administrate a title bought at one event and used at another when it is no longer valid - and it is not consistent with [[The Way|the way]] all other Imperial titles operate.
