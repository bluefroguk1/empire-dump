__NOTOC__
Using the powers of the [[Arcane Architect]], I am intending to construct a summer mana [[Sinecure]] in [[Reikos]]. It is a self-funded, highly efficient sinecure.''Raised by the Arcane [[Architect]]''
## Overview
* The Arcane Architect used their power to [[Commission]] mana structures to announce this construction.
## Date
* Spring 382YE
## [[Cost]]
* Unknown
## PrOgress
* 3 [[White granite]], 3 [[Weirwood]] and 12 crowns provided by Vittore after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
## Campaign Outcome
* When completed, this Sinecure will create an [[Imperial Title]]. 
* The Arcane Architect will need to provide additional necessary details about the commission including the Region where it well be located and the method of appointing the associated title.
## Constitution
* When complete the sinecure will create a title [[Keeper of the Cox]].
* It is not possible to create a sinecure that produces [[Vis]] without an appropriate [[Opportunity]]; it is assumed that the Arcane Architect is in possession of such a thing.
* The strict wording of the powers of the Arcane Architect suggested that they could commission ''structures that will produce crystal mana.'' Summer vis is not crystal mana; the Constitutional Court sought the guidance of the [[Imperial Senate]] on whether they intended to allow structures that produce vis to be included in the Architect's remit, and the Senators confirmed that they did.
