__NOTOC__
Using the powers of the [[Arcane Architect]], I am intending to construct a [[Summer|summer]] mana [[Sinecure|sinecure]] in [[Reikos]]. It is a self-funded, highly efficient [[Sinecure|sinecure]].''Raised by the Arcane [[Architect]]''
## Overview
* The [[Arcane Architect]] used their power to [[Commission|commission]] mana structures to announce this construction.
## Date
* [[Spring]] 382YE
## [[Cost]]
* Unknown
## Progress
* 3 [[White granite|white granite]], 3 [[Weirwood|weirwood]] and 12 crowns provided by Vittore after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
## [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* When completed, this Sinecure [[Will|will]] create an [[Imperial Title]]. 
* The Arcane [[Architect]] [[Will|will]] need to provide additional necessary details about the [[Commission|commission]] including the region where it well be located and the method of appointing the associated title.
## Constitution
* When complete the sinecure will create a title [[Keeper of the Cox]].
* It is not possible to create a sinecure that produces [[Vis]] without an appropriate [[Opportunity]]; it is assumed that the Arcane Architect is in possession of such a thing.
* The strict wording of the powers of the Arcane Architect suggested that they could commission ''structures that will produce crystal mana.'' Summer [[Vis|vis]] is not crystal mana; the Constitutional Court sought the guidance of the [[Imperial Senate]] on whether they intended to allow structures that produce vis to be included in the Architect's remit, and the Senators confirmed that they did.
