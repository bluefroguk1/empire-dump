__NOTOC__
In [[Recognition|recognition]] of their [[Loyalty]] to [[The Empire|the Empire]], for ceding [[Territory|territory]] to the [[Thule]] as a price for peace, I move that one of the Imperial Wayleaves auctioned via [[The Bourse|the Bourse]] instead be assigned to the [[Imperial Orcs]] via their well worn paths and traditions. ''Proposed by [[Hahnmark]], seconded by [[Segura]].''
## Overview
* One of the three [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]] titles would be permanently allocated to the [[Imperial Orcs]] nation.
* Passed
## Date
* [[Summer]] 382YE
## Outcome
* This would effectively remove one of the Imperial Wayleaves from the [[Public auction|public auction]], and make it a national title for the [[Imperial Orcs]].
* The [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]] raised during the [[Autumn]] Equinox confirms that this [[Will|will]] be a title held for a year.
## Constitution
This motion initially failed [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]]. The Constitutional Court [[Will|will]] not permit a national title to be appointed that lasts a single season, the circumstances that make that legal for a Wayleave are unique to wayleaves which are sold by [[Public auction|public auction]] to all citizens. The constitutional court would not permit a title with the power of [[Commission|commission]] to be appointed for a single season, primarily because it is too burdensome for both the civil service and for citizens to appoint the title that frequently.
The motion would be constitutional if also changed the title to serve for a year, instead of a single season. As this guidance was not provided before the motion was brought before [[The Senate|the Senate]], the court indicated that they would raise an administrative motion on the Friday [[Night|night]] of the Autumn Equinox summit to request confirmation or rejection by the [[Imperial Senate]] on that basis. 
The administrative motion was raised and passed, amending the title to a year-long [[Tenure|tenure]]. The [[Senator|senator]] for [[Hahnmark]] still needs to provide a name for the [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] that is created by this motion.
