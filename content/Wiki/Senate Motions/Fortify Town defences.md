Defensive improvements required for towns in [[The League|the League]], [[Marches]] and [[Highguard]].
''Proposed by [[Mitwold]], seconded by [[Temeschwar]].''
### Overview
* Defensive improvements required for towns in [[The League]], [[The Marches]] and [[Highguard]]
* Passed at 60 Thrones with 13 votes against, money distributed to [[Senator]] [[Mitwold]].
### Date
* Passed [[Winter]] 376YE (Easter 2013)
### [[Cost]]
* 40 wains of [[White granite|White Granite]] [[Will|will]] provide sufficient [[Fortification|fortification]] to suppress banditry in these regions
* 300 wains of [[White granite|White Granite]] are required to fortify these regions
### Progress
* 40 wains of [[White granite|White Granite]] presented by Bridget Eastville nee Talbot, [[Senator]] for [[Mitwold]] in Winter Solstice 2013 [[Downtime|downtime]]
### Constitution
* This motion does not follow constitutional protocol
[[Senate Motions|Senate motions]] should only contain a single item. The motion was not struck down by [[Magistrates|magistrates]] at the time and the construction has now begun.
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* Banditry in [[League]], Marches and [[Highguard]] suppressed
* Meade, Sybela and Mellfort have been partially fortified.
Partial [[Fortification|fortification]] does not confer a military advantage. It is sufficient to redress the banditry problems in those areas, but not sufficient to class as a separate [[Fortification|fortification]]. It would require a total of 260 additional wains of [[White granite|White Granite]] to complete the three [[Fortifications]].
