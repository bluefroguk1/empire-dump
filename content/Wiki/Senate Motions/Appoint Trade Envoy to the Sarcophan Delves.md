To elect a Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves
Administrative Motion 
### Overview
* First appointment of the Trade Envoy to the [[Sarcophan Delves]] after the title's creation in Winter 379Ye
### Date
* Spring 380YE
### Campaign Outcome
* Thanmir Hrafn was appointed [[Create title of Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves#Constitution|Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves]].
### Constitution
* OOC Note: Parts of this section were superseded by the [[Rules update 2018]].
As explained during the [[Create title of Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves|creation of the title]], this title has no power to handle diplomatic relations with the Sarcophan Delves. It is a ceremonial title, with the responsibility for helping with trade with the Sarcophan Delves - it does not have legal powers. Authority to negotiate with the Sarcophan Delves continues to remain with the [[Imperial Consul]] until an [[Embassy]] is built. 
Experience has shown that all attempts to initiate diplomacy with foreign nations without first building an embassy are ineffective.
