To elect a [[Trade envoy]] to the [[Sarcophan Delves]]
Administrative Motion 
### Overview
* First [[Appointment]] of the Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves after the title's creation in Winter 379Ye
### Date
* Spring 380YE
### Campaign Outcome
* Thanmir Hrafn was appointed Trade Envoy to the Sarcophan Delves.
### Constitution
* OOC Note: Parts of this section were superseded by the Rules update 2018.
As explained during the creation of the title, this title has no power to handle diplomatic relations with the Sarcophan Delves. It is a ceremonial title, with the responsibility for helping with trade with the Sarcophan Delves - it does not have legal powers. Authority to negotiate with the Sarcophan Delves continues to remain with the [[Imperial Consul]] until an [[Embassy]] is built. 
Experience has shown that all attempts to initiate diplomacy with [[Foreign Nations]] without first building an embassy are ineffective.
