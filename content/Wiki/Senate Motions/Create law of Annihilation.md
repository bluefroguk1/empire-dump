* Passed
### Date

* There is some concern that this crime is not defined in such a way that a conviction can ever be secured; it is being reviewed by the Constitutional court and the Magistrates.
* The magistrates will work with the Senator for Semmerholm to secure a definition of this crime that they believe is enforcable, then present their findings to the Senate for approval as an administrative motion.
