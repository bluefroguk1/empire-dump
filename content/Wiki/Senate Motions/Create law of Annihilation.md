__NOTOC__
To make the act of Annihilation – defined as destroying or, endangering with destruction, a human soul – a crime under [[Imperial Law]].
Proposed by [[Semmerholm]], seconded by [[Holberg]]. 
### Overview
* Creating a law making it illegal to destroy a human soul.
* Passed
### Date
* Spring 380YE
### Campaign Outcome
* This law requires additional definition before it can be enforced.
### Constitution
* There is some concern that this crime is not defined in such a way that a [[Conviction]] can ever be secured; it is being reviewed by the Constitutional court and the Magistrates.
* The magistrates will work with the [[Senator]] for Semmerholm to secure a definition of this crime that they believe is enforcable, then present their findings to the Senate for approval as an administrative motion.
