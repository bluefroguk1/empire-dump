## Consitution
Immediately after the summit had ended, the [[Imperial Civil Service]] were informed that this motion was in error on the specific Region where the House of the Proferred Hand was to be built. As the work had not yet begun on the commission, the civil service have indicated that they would raise an administrative motion to confirm that the [[Imperial Senate]] will approve the construction at Caer Faucon (a small town in southern Astolat near the [[Highguard]] border).
The administrative motion was raised during the Autumn Equinox, and the Senate confirmed the construction of the House of the Proferred Hand at Caer Faucon.
