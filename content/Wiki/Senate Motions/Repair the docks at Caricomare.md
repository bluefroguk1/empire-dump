### Costing
* 35 [[White granite]]

The Caricomare Quays was a [[Great work]] that is now ruined. If restored it would mean that every [[Fleet]] from [[The League]] operating out of Sarvos would have produced more wealth for their owners. The total benefit would be 480 rings per season - divided between all the fleets which are active in Sarvos that season.
