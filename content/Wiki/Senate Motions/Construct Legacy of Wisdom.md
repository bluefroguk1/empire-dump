__NOTOC__
An announcement by bearer of an Imperial Wayleave, Edmundo. To construct a great work in Morrow to enhance the production of mana. To be known as ‘Lorenzo’s Legacy of Wisdom.’ At a cost of 40 wains of mithril and 10 thrones to be funded by ‘La Volpe’ and the Bloody Butchers of Temeschwar.''Imperial Wayleave by of Damakan's Forge''
## Overview
* Constructs a [[Great work]] in [[Morrow]].
* Announcement
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## Costs
* This [[Great work]] uses [[Great work#Costs|standard costs]].
* 40 wains of mithril
* 80 crowns labour
* Three months to complete
## Progress
* 40 wains of mithril and 10 Thrones provided by Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar following the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* Due to the Druj invasion of Morrow, all progress was lost. Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar received a partial refund after the Summer Solstice 382Y.
## Outcome
* The Druj [[382YE Autumn Equinox winds of war#Lost in the Echo .28Morrow.29|invasion of Morrow]] resulted in the destruction of the construction site of the central stellae and several smalelr stelae. As such the contributor received a partial refund for materials and labour costs. In theory if Caeli were recaptured before the Summer Solstice 383YE, construction could be begun again without the need for either another [[Senate motion|senate motion]] or a new commission, but work would need to start from scratch.
* When complete, the commission would have created a great work that distributes 37 crystal mana between the [[Mana site|mana sites]] of [[Morrow]].
