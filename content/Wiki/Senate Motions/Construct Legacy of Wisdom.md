__NOTOC__
An announcement by [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]], Edmundo. To construct a [[Great work]] in [[Morrow]] to enhance the production of mana. To be known as ‘Lorenzo’s [[Legacy]] of [[Wisdom]].’ At a [[Cost]] of 40 wains of [[Mithril]] and 10 thrones to be funded by ‘La Volpe’ and the Bloody Butchers of [[Temeschwar]].''Imperial Wayleave by of Damakan's Forge''
## Overview
* Constructs a Great work in Morrow.
* Announcement
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## Costs
* This Great work uses standard costs.
* 40 wains of mithril
* 80 crowns labour
* Three months to complete
## PrOgress
* 40 wains of mithril and 10 Thrones provided by Lorenzo MacelLiao von Temeschwar following the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* Due to the [[Druj]] invasion of Morrow, all progress was lost. Lorenzo Macelliao von Temeschwar received a partial refund after the Summer Solstice 382Y.
## Outcome
* The Druj invasion of Morrow resulted in the destruction of the construction site of the central stellae and several smalelr stelae. As such the contributor received a partial refund for [[Materials]] and labour costs. In theory if Caeli were recaptured before the Summer Solstice 383YE, construction could be begun again without the need for either another [[Senate motion]] or a new Commission, but work would need to start from scratch.
* When complete, the commission would have created a great work that distributes 37 crystal mana between the Mana sites of Morrow.
