__NOTOC__
I, Sagua i'Ezmara, [[Master of the Koboldi]], am announcing the plans to improve the Court of the White Fountain in [[Redoubt]] in order to make it unbreakable. Edmundo of Damakhan's Forge has agreed to supply the [[Ilium]] required. Cato AuricSpire of the Scarlet Guard is organising the casting of the ritual on its completion. As part of this improvement there will be a small office and suit of rooms provided for [[The Captain]] of [[The Fountain]]'s Guard, a tenured national position chosen by the [[General]](s) of [[Urizen]]. This title will be responsible for the fortress and the morale and training of the guards stationed there.
