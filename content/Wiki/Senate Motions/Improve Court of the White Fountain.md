__NOTOC__
I, Sagua i'Ezmara, Master of the Koboldi, am announcing the plans to improve the Court of the White Fountain in Redoubt in order to make it unbreakable. Edmundo of Damakhan's Forge has agreed to supply the ilium required. Cato Auricspire of the Scarlet Guard is organising the casting of the ritual on its completion. As part of this improvement there will be a small office and suit of rooms provided for the Captain of the Fountain's Guard, a tenured national position chosen by the general(s) of Urizen.
