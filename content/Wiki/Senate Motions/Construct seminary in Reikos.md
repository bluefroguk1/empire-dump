__NOTOC__
To construct a Great Work in Reikos. This is to be an artificial lake at the site of the Vigilant Swan to replace the drained pools, so the swans may return, and we can show the Druj that whatever they destroy, we can rebuild better. At the centre of the lake is to be a seminary to train magisters of Highguard in the ways of magic and Virtue, and it will provide a benefit to the mana site owners of the territory.''Proposed by Casinea, seconded by Tassato.''
