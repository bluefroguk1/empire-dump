__NOTOC__
To construct a [[Great work]] in [[Reikos]]. This is to be an artificial lake at the site of the [[Vigilant Swan]] to replace the drained pools, so the swans may return, and we can show the [[Druj]] that whatever they destroy, we can rebuild better. At the centre of the lake is to be a seminary to train magisters of [[Highguard]] in The Ways of [[Magic]] and Virtue, and it will provide a benefit to the [[Mana site]] owners of the territory.''Proposed by [[Casinea]], seconded by [[Tassato]].''
