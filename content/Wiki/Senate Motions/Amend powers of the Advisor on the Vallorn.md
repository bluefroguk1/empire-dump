Motion to combine the titles ‘Advisor on the Vallorn’ and ‘Terunael Lorekeeper’. The title and allocation will remain as Advisor on the Vallorn but will include the responsibilities of the Terunael Lorekeeper. The responsibilities are the overseeing of the Great Library and protecting the lore stored there. The Advisor would be based out of the Great Library of Hacynian and in turn that would develop into a specialist library for Vallorn information. There is no cost for this change.Administrative
