Put civil servants back on boats in order to prevent piracy.Proposed by [[Zenith]], seconded by [[Tassato]]
### Overview
* Piracy of foreign Fleets is damaging relations with [[Foreign Nations]]
* The Senate has instructed the civil service to put observers on every Imperial [[Fleet]] to ensure compliance with the law
### Date
* Summer 379YE
### Upkeep
* 50 Thrones per season
### Campaign Outcome
* Re-instates the Earlier placement of civil servants on ships leaving Imperial ports
* The presence of a civil service observer on every fleet in [[The Empire]] makes it effectively impossible for PCs to engage in piracy of foreign nations or trade with Barbarian nations. Consequently both options have been removed from the downtime system immediately. 
* This measure was initally proposed during the Summer Solstice 378YE.
* It was then abrograted during the Spring Equinox 379YE summit.
