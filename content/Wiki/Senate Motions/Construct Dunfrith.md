__NOTOC__
Ham, son of Brigantia, son of Frecki and of BRuin, lead apothecary of Dunhearth and descendant of the Great Dun, apprentice of [[Wise Rangara]] and Saviour of Holburg, with the authority of the Great Thane, Tobrytan Dunning, called Spooner, has instructed the Foresters of Woodhall in the southernmost reaches of [[Hahnmark]], close by their home of Dunhearth Hall, to fell trees in such a way as to create glades. These glades are positioned most carefUlly and plantings and experimentations have shown that conditions are such that, in the most exposed and Northern facing areas, [[Bladeroot]] grows vigorously, as it does in many areas of [[Wintermark]], in the Southern facing and most sheltered glades, [[Cerulean Mazzarine]] grows strongly and well, in the glades carefully placed upon sites of skirmishes with the [[Feni]], [[Marrowort]] does flourish, and True Vervain and [[Imperial Roseweald]] will both grow well in this area, even without careful tending.
As such, and as a [[Legacy]] to future generations, a balanced [[Herb]] [[Sinecure]] is proposed, funded by the [[Family]] of Ham, and to be overseen by him, for as long as he does live, that he may provide Potions for the benefit of [[The Empire]].
It shall be called Dunfrith, meaning in the old tongue “[[Forest]] of Dun” and the custodian shall always be known as the [[Guardian of Dunfrith]].
Approved by the [[Civilian Commissioner]] of Wintermark
