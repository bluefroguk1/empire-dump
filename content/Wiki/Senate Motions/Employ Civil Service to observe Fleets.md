Place a Civil Servant on all Fleets leaving Imperial waters with the intention of cessation of piracy.
Proposed by [[Sermersuaq]], seconded by [[Skarsind]]
### Overview
* Piracy of foreign fleets is damaging relations with [[Foreign Nations]]
* The Senate has instructed the civil service to put observers on every Imperial [[Fleet]] to ensure compliance with the law
### Date
* Summer 378YE
### Upkeep
* 50 Thrones per season
### Campaign Outcome
* The presence of a civil service observer on every fleet in [[The Empire]] makes it effectively impossible for PCs to engage in piracy of foreign nations or trade with [[Barbarian]] nations. Consequently both options have been removed from the downtime system immediately. 
* This measure was abrograted during the Spring Equinox 379YE summit.
* This motion was re-instated during the Summer Solstice 379YE summit.
