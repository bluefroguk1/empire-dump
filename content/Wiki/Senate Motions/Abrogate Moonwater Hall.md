* The trade hub provided the benefits of a [[Great work]] in Upwold, adding additional income to [[Farm|farms]] and [[Business|businesses]].
* Passed
### Date
* Summer 384YE
### Outcome
The trade hub has been destroyed; it will no longer provide any benefits to the [[Farm|farms]] and [[Business|businesses]] of Upwold. In the process of abrogating the trade hall, most of the buildings were pulled down and the Faraden informed that the Senate no longer wished them to congregate there. There was some anger from the Faraden who requested (and received) a week to put their affairs in order, make preparations, and dispatch messengers to Faraden merchants visiting the Empire.
