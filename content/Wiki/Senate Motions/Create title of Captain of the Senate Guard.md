### Constitution
The [[Imperial Senate]] has given the [[Assembly]] of [[Loyalty]] the ability to revoke [[The Captain|the Captain]] of the Senate Guard. The Constitutional Scholars point out that this is in ''addition'' to the ability of the Assembly of Nine and the [[General]] Assembly to revoke the title. The Senate can give additional assemblies the power to revoke a title, but they cannot create a title in such a way that they remove the ability of an assembly to revoke it.
