__NOTOC__
In support of the People of the Mark's wishes following the Autumn 383YE, unanimous Greater Majority [[Judgement]] of the [[Wintermark]] National [[Assembly]]: A Time-Limited, Must Happen Now, motion to: Create a vibrant new [[Herb]]-garden [[Sinecure]] outside Masi in [[Kallavesa]] Marsh named "Hufi's Garden". Creating at the request of Healers and herbalists of Wintermark a position for its holder, recognised and acknowledge across the Mark via the new [[Imperial Title]] - the "[[Woundbinder of the Mark]]." The [[Woundbinder]] of the Mark would have a responsibility to inSpire the grimnir and healers of the nation and ensure the wounded [[Heroes]] of Wintermark are well tended to. If Wintermark heroes pay the Wounderbinder whatever coin they could spare. The herbalists of Wintermark pledge their support in the form of a supply of additional herbs the Woundbinder may acquire to save more lives. Estimated to a maximum of 67 additional herbs available. The Grimnirs and Healers of Wintermark feel that this title should lead by example rather than be appointed by the Thanes Council, and as such they will make their wishes clear to the Senators of Wintermark who shall appoint unanimously. [[Cost]]: 16 wains [[White granite]] and 32 crowns and requires an imperial [[Commission]]. The sinecure produces 10 doses of true vervain, 4 doses of [[Bladeroot]], 4 doses of [[Imperial Roseweald]], 4 doses of [[Marrowort]] and 2 doses of rare [[Realmsroot]].
