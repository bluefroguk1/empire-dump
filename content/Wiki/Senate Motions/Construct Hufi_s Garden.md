__NOTOC__
In support of the People of the Mark's wishes following the [[Autumn]] 383YE, unanimous [[Greater majority|Greater Majority]] [[Judgement]] of the [[Wintermark]] National [[Assembly]]: A Time-Limited, Must Happen Now, motion to: Create a vibrant new [[Herb|herb]]-garden [[Sinecure|sinecure]] outside Masi in [[Kallavesa]] Marsh named "Hufi's Garden". Creating at the request of healers and herbalists of [[Wintermark]] a position for its holder, recognised and acknowledge across the Mark via the new [[Imperial Title]] - the "[[Woundbinder of the Mark]]." The [[Woundbinder]] of the Mark would have a responsibility to inspire the [[Grimnir|grimnir]] and healers of the nation and ensure the wounded [[Heroes|heroes]] of Wintermark are well tended to. If Wintermark [[Heroes|heroes]] pay the Wounderbinder whatever coin they could spare. The herbalists of Wintermark pledge their support in the form of a supply of additional [[Herbs|herbs]] the [[Woundbinder]] may acquire to save more lives. Estimated to a maximum of 67 additional herbs available. The Grimnirs and Healers of Wintermark feel that this title should lead by example rather than be appointed by the Thanes Council, and as such they [[Will|will]] make their wishes clear to the Senators of Wintermark who shall appoint unanimously. [[Cost]]: 16 wains [[White granite|white granite]] and 32 crowns and requires an imperial [[Commission|commission]]. The [[Sinecure|sinecure]] produces 10 doses of [[True Vervain|true vervain]], 4 doses of [[Bladeroot|bladeroot]], 4 doses of [[Imperial Roseweald|imperial roseweald]], 4 doses of [[Marrowort|marrowort]] and 2 doses of rare [[Realmsroot|realmsroot]].
