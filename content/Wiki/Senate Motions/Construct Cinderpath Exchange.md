__NOTOC__
To construct the Cinderpath Exchange in Mareholm, [[Casinea]]. This is a [[Ministry|ministry]] that allows the purchase of [[White granite|white granite]]. This [[Will|will]] be self-funded. This [[Will|will]] create the [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] ‘Cinderpath [[Benefactor]]’ who [[Will|will]] be appointed annually by the National [[Assembly]] of [[Highguard]].''Proposed by [[Necropolis]], seconded by [[Redoubt]].''
## Overview
* [[Commission]] the Cinderpath Exchange, an [[Opportunity]] presented by the [[Benefactors|benefactors]] of [[Highguard]].
* Failed.
## Date
* [[Summer]] 382YE
## [[Scrutiny]]
During [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] of this motion it was discovered that Abraham had given incorrect information on the floor of [[The Senate|the Senate]] regarding the potential impact of this motion on the amount of [[White granite|white granite]] that would be available on the [[Public auction|public auction]]. As this error was judged to be significant in the decision to reject the motion, the civil service  indicated that they would raise an [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]] for the [[Imperial Senate]] to reconsider this [[Opportunity|opportunity]]. After consultation with the [[Senator|senator]] for [[Necropolis]], they have requested that the motion be raised at the Friday evening [[Senate session]].
Currently, with the Highborn [[Assembly|assembly]] [[Mandate|mandate]] supporting it, the Cinderpath Exchange would remove 6 wains of [[White granite|white granite]] each season from the [[Public auction|public auction]]. If, when it were competed, the [[General]] [[Assembly|assembly]] [[Mandate|mandate]] were passed, the amount removed would rise to 8 wains.
The administative motion was raised but failed. The Cinderpath Exchange [[Will|will]] not be constructed.
### Constitutional [[Challenge]]
Following a constitutional [[Challenge|challenge]] it was confirmed that it was unconstitutional for this [[Ministry|ministry]] to be appointed by the Highborn [[Assembly|assembly]]; rather it would be appointed by vote of Highborn congregations. A subtle but significant difference.
