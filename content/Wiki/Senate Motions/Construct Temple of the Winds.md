__NOTOC__
To construct the Temple of the Winds in Morrow to provide a permanent home for the sword scholars.''Proposed by Miekarova, seconded by Morrow.''
## Overview
* Commission a [[Sinecure]] in [[Morrow]] as part of an [[Opportunity]] presented by the [[Sword scholar|sword scholars]] allowing them a [[An ideal for living#Test What You Learn|central spire]] from which to spread their philosophy.
* As originally envisioned the construction will create an [[Imperial Title]]
* Passed in principle.
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## Cost
* This sinecure is the result of an [[An ideal for living#Test What You Learn|opportunity]].
* 10 wains of white granite
* 20 crowns
* three months to complete
## Progress
* 20 Crowns provided by Nikolovich Drakov after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* 10 wains of White Granite provided by Edmundo of Damakan's forge after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* Due to the Druj invasion of Morrow, all progress was lost. Nikolovich Drakov and Edmundo of Damakan's Forge received partial refunds after the Summer Solstice 382Y.
* 10 wains of white granite and 20 crowns provided by Edmundo of Damakan's Forge after the Spring Equinox 383YE.
## Campaign Outcome
* The Druj [[382YE Autumn Equinox winds of war#Lost in the Echo .28Morrow.29|invasion of Morrow]] resulted in the destruction of the construction site in Morrow. The contributors received partial refunds for materials and labour costs. 
* Peregro was successfully recaptured from the Druj in time for construction to begin again without the need for either another [[Senate motion|senate motion]] or a new commission, but work needed to start from scratch.
* The temple created the title [[Envoy to the Disciples of the Tempest Jade Maiden]].
* During the Summer Solstice 383YE, an administrative motion was raised to resolve the issue of the labyrinth sword. The Sword Scholars of Morrow have stipulated that the ‘Labyrinth Sword’ must be part of the Regalia of the Master of the Temple of the Winds. Does the Senate wish to amend this title to accede to that demand?” Without this amendment, the Master of the Temple of the Winds can still be appointed, but they will have no legal powers as the remaining Sword Scholars will not support the Temple. Passed.
