* The Druj invasion of Morrow resulted in the destruction of the construction site in Morrow. The contributors received partial refunds for [[Materials]] and labour costs.

* During the Summer Solstice 383YE, an administrative motion was raised to resolve the issue of the labyrinth sword. The Sword Scholars of Morrow have stipulated that the ‘Labyrinth Sword’ must be part of the Regalia of the Master of the Temple of the Winds. Does the Senate wish to aMend this title to accede to that demand?” Without this amendment, the Master of the Temple of the Winds can still be appointed, but they will have no legal powers as the remaining Sword Scholars will not support the Temple. Passed.
