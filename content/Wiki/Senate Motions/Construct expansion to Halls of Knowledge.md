__NOTOC__
To expand the Halls of Knowledge to include an Autumn wing..''Proposed by [[Morrow]], seconded by [[Miekarova]].''
## Overview
* Expand the Halls of Knowledge in Peregro to include a wing dedicated to the research of [[Autumn magic]].
* Passed in principle.
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## [[Cost]]
* The civil service have deterMined the costs for this expansion.
* 25 wains of [[Mithril]]
* 25 wains of [[White granite]]
* 25 wains of [[Weirwood]]
* 150 crowns
* six months to complete
## PrOgress
* 25 wains of mithril, 19 wains of weirwood, 1 wain of white granite, and 12 thrones provided by Agrippa after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* Due to the [[Druj]] invasion of Morrow, all progress on this project was lost. Agrippa received a partial refund after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
## Campaign Outcome
* The Druj invasion of Morrow resulted in the destruction of the Halls of Knowlege, and ended construction work. The contributor received a partial refund of [[Materials]] and labour costs. This senate Commission cannot now be completed.
* When complete, this would have allowed the [[Provost of the Halls of Knowledge]] the power to research Autumn [[Magic]] at the rate of 15 ranks each season, and allowed them to spend money to enhance the speed of that research.
