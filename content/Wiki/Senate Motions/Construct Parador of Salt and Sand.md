## Outcome
* Once complete [[The Brass Coast]] title of [[Hakima of Salt and Sand]] will be available to appoint by [[Tally of the Votes]]
* The Parador of Sand and Salt could be expanded into a [[College of Magic]] at any point, with a significantly reduced upkeep cost.
*  [[Imperial Law]] prohibits a title being legally restricted to a specific group of people, but the opportunity makes it crystal clear that the Freeborn who attend [[Anvil]] would be expected to ensure that they only ever elected a [[Hakima]] to the position and there would be consequences if they appointed anyone else.
* In addition to these benefits, the Parador would further solidify the central important of Quzar in Madruga and create a community of supportive hakima who could help with magical research if given the right facilities. While the Parador stands, it could be upgraded into a fUll College of [[Magic]] at any time at a cost of 55 wains of mithril and 55 wains of weirwood, 55 wains of white granite, and 330 crowns. The upgrade would require a [[Commission]] slot and could be authorized by anyone with the power to commission a college of magic. The Hakima would ''retain'' the ability to purchase mana crystals from the Parador but gain the additional abilities provided by a college of magic.
* If the Parador were upgraded then the presence of so many hakima in Quzar would provide a crucial additional benefit. As long as the Hakima of Sand and Salt was seen to be a Hakima in good standing, then the total seasonal upkeep of [[The Empire]]'s colleges of magic would be reduced by 20 thrones a season.
