__NOTOC__
I announce the construction of the Parador of Salt and Sand, taking advantage of the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to build a mana [[Ministry|ministry]] in Quzar, [[Madruga]].
## Overview
* Commissions a [[Ministry]] as detailed in the [[The power behind our moves]] wind of fortune.
* Announcement by the  [[Bearer of an Imperial Wayleave]]
## Date
* [[Winter]] 384YE
## [[Cost]]
* As per the wind of fortune

* 5 wains of [[White granite|white granite]]
* 5 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]]

## Progress

## Outcome
* Once complete [[The Brass Coast]] title of [[Hakima of Salt and Sand]] [[Will|will]] be available to appoint by [[Tally of the Votes]]
* The Parador of Sand and Salt could be expanded into a [[College of Magic]] at any point, with a significantly reduced upkeep [[Cost|cost]].
*  [[Imperial Law|Imperial law]] prohibits a title being legally restricted to a specific group of people, but the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] makes it crystal clear that the [[Freeborn]] who attend [[Anvil]] would be expected to ensure that they only ever elected a [[Hakima]] to the position and there would be consequences if they appointed anyone else.
* In addition to these benefits, the Parador would further solidify the central important of Quzar in [[Madruga]] and create a community of supportive [[Hakima|hakima]] who could help with magical research if given the right facilities. While the Parador stands, it could be upgraded into a full College of [[Magic]] at any time at a [[Cost|cost]] of 55 wains of [[Mithril|mithril]] and 55 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], 55 wains of [[White granite|white granite]], and 330 crowns. The upgrade would require a [[Commission|commission]] slot and could be authorized by anyone with the power to [[Commission|commission]] a [[College of Magic|college of magic]]. The [[Hakima]] would ''retain'' the ability to purchase mana crystals from the Parador but gain the additional abilities provided by a college of [[Magic|magic]].
* If the Parador were upgraded then the presence of so many [[Hakima|hakima]] in Quzar would provide a crucial additional benefit. As long as the [[Hakima]] of Sand and Salt was seen to be a hakima in good standing, then the total seasonal upkeep of [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s colleges of [[Magic|magic]] would be reduced by 20 thrones a season.
