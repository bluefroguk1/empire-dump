## Campaign Outcome
* When complete, the structure will be ceded to the eternal Adamant. 
* As per the agreements with the eternal, the ''Master of the Koboldi'' will be Adamant's representative to [[The Empire]], and vice versa. 
* Adamant has stipulated that the structure be built in a rugged, hilly Region (one that has the hills quality). The only such region in Temeschwar is Locul.
* Adamant intended that the Master of the Koboldi would be able to announce a single commission each season that uses at least 30 wains of white granite as part of its costs. This commission will not count against the limited number of commissions the Empire can begin each season. Adamant is strenuous in his assertion that he will only provide this Assistance if the Master of the Koboldi is free to build a [[Folly]], [[Fortification]], [[Ministry]], [[Great work]], [[Sinecure]], [[Runeforge]], or College of [[College of Magic]] as they see fit. This criteria has ''not'' been met by the wording of this motion.
* During the Winter Solstice 382YE, this motion was aMended to bring it into line with the eternal's intent.
