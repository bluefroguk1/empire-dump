__NOTOC__
To expand through construction the Library of Hacynian in Hercynia to be the Great Library, collating the lore of the Vallorn from across the world. The title 'Advisor of the Vallorn' to remain unchanged. The library will be the culmination of a people's desire of a future, and testimony to an Empire that will win the long war against its greater spiritual foe. This is a time-limited opportunity that a nation has waited generations for, so let us stride with ambition to a brighter future. Given the costs of the Library's expansion at 50 wains of white granite, 40 wains of weirwood, and 30 wains of mithril, and 240 crowns, Navarr request's a disbursement of funds from the Senate for this commission.
