__NOTOC__
To create the title of Ambassador to the Thule.
Appointment by vote of the Senate.
Revoked by well worn path.
Proposed by Kallavesa, Seconded by Morrow
### Overview
* This motion creates the title of [[Ambassador to Otkodov|Ambassador to the Thule]] taking advantage of the recent [[Spear of the stars#Ambassador to the Thule|opportunity]]
* Passed
### Date
* Spring 381YE
### Campaign Outcome
* The title [[Ambassador to Otkodov]] was created
* Juha, the Cave Spider of Varushka was appointed as the first Ambassador in Spring 381YE
* This motion attempted to take advantage of an opportunity. While there no legal issues with this tile, one of the requirements of that opportunity was that this be a national Varushkan position. The Imperial Senate is under no obligation to concede to the Thule "request", but as always with international relations, an Imperial ambassador is only as influential as the foreign nation allows them to be.
