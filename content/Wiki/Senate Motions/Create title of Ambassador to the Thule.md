__NOTOC__
To create the title of [[Ambassador]] to the [[Thule]].
[[Appointment]] by vote of [[The Senate|the Senate]].
Revoked by well worn path.
Proposed by [[Kallavesa]], Seconded by [[Morrow]]
### Overview
* This motion creates the title of [[Ambassador]] to the [[Thule]] taking advantage of the recent [[Opportunity|opportunity]]
* Passed
### Date
* [[Spring]] 381YE
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* The title [[Ambassador to Otkodov]] was created
* Juha, the Cave Spider of [[Varushka]] was appointed as the first [[Ambassador]] in Spring 381YE
* This motion attempted to take advantage of an [[Opportunity|opportunity]]. While there no legal issues with this tile, one of the requirements of that [[Opportunity|opportunity]] was that this be a national Varushkan position. The [[Imperial Senate]] is under no obligation to concede to the [[Thule]] "request", but as always with international relations, an Imperial [[Ambassador|ambassador]] is only as influential as the foreign nation allows them to be.
