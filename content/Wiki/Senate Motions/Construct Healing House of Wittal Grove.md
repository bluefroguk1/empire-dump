## Outcome
* 328 thrones disbursed to the [[Senator]] for Kallavesa
* Once completed the great work will provide a shared bounty to all [[Herb]] gardens in Kallavesa
* There are constitutional issues with this [[Commission]]
## Constitution
* The [[Opportunity]] presented an option to create an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the Healing House. This was not presented as part of the [[Senate motion]]. 
* Discussion with Senator Kallavesa confirmed the intent to create the title [[Grimnir of Wittal Grove]] with the intent that "the title ... is intended specifically to be held by a grimnir".
* The commission will go ahead but an administrative motion will be raised to allow the Senate to abrogate the title if they wish. Should they do so, this will create significant problems with the grimnir of [[Wintermark]] who have committed their time and resources to supporting the House.
* The constitutional court notes that this convoluted approach is being put forWard as a consequence of the problems caused by memory altering mists, and urges all Senators to ensure they have included vital details on their Senate motion in future.
* The administrative motion was raised and failed.
