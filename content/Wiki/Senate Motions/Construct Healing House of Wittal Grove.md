* There are constitutional issues with this [[Commission|commission]]
## Constitution
* The [[Opportunity|opportunity]] presented an option to create an [[Imperial Title]] to oversee the Healing House. This was not presented as part of the [[Senate motion|Senate Motion]]. 
* Discussion with [[Senator]] [[Kallavesa]] confirmed the intent to create the title [[Grimnir of Wittal Grove]] with the intent that "the title ... is intended specifically to be held by a [[Grimnir|grimnir]]".
* The [[Commission|commission]] [[Will|will]] go ahead but an [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]] [[Will|will]] be raised to allow [[The Senate|the Senate]] to abrogate the title if they wish. Should they do so, this [[Will|will]] create significant problems with the grimnir of [[Wintermark]] who have committed their time and resources to supporting the House.
* The constitutional court notes that this convoluted approach is being put forward as a consequence of the problems caused by memory altering mists, and urges all Senators to ensure they have included vital details on their [[Senate motion]] in future.
* The administrative motion was raised and failed.
