## Campaign Outcome
* Completed shortly before the WInter Solstice 383YE, the expansion has granted the High Herbalist of Sybella, Master of the Clearing House, and Kruidenkenner Trademaster access to a [[Ministry]] to buy herbs from the Sarcophans.
* The Vizier of the Incarnadine Satchel also has access to a new ministry, but before they can take advantage of it the Senate would need to establish new offices for them as detailed in the [[To curb those raging appetites]] Wind of Fortune.
