__NOTOC__
To [[Expand the Kruidenkenner Magazjin|expand the Kruidenkenner Magazjin]] at Crownâ€™s Quay. 
This will create no new imperial titles but will significantly enhance the existing ministries of the High Herbalist of Sybella in Highguard, the Master of the Clearing House in the League, the Vizier of the Incarnadine Satchel in the Brass Coast, and the Kruidenkenner Trademaster.

## Campaign Outcome
* Completed shortly before the WInter Solstice 383YE, the expansion has granted the [[High Herbalist of Sybella]], [[Master of the Clearing House]], and [[Kruidenkenner Trademaster]] access to a ministry to buy herbs from the Sarcophans.
* The [[Vizier of the Incarnadine Satchel]] also has access to a new ministry, but before they can take advantage of it the Senate would need to establish new offices for them as detailed in the [[To curb those raging appetites#Lost Opportunities|To curb those raging appetites]] Wind of Fortune.
