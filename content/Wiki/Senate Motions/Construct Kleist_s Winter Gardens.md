__NOTOC__
[[Holberg]] Endures! Skathe the Hag Queen Cursed Holmauer Park with [[Winter magic]]. This Commission builds Kleist's Winter Gardens at the Holberg University Duelling Grounds. We can use Marcher menhirs to channel that Winter [[Magic]] to grow herbs. The [[Imperial Title]] will be "Tender of Kleist's Winter Gardens". This title is appointed annually by [[Imperial Bourse]] Auction. This is a well-worn path. We are Kleist von Ennerlund, Vintners and Victuallers of Holberg. We are self-funding this commission to the tune of 15 [[White granite]], 15 [[Weirwood]] and about 25 thrones. Auctioning it brings coin into the Senate budget. We support our Empire becausae we are League, and for the benefit of our beloved city Holberg.

## Outcome
The Opportunity this commission required that "''The title could be appointed by the Senators of [[The League]], or perhaps assigned by the business owners of the League via the Imperial Bourse''." As things stand, Abigal and Theodora are not prepared to offer their [[Assistance]] to build the gardens as an Imperial position. Three possibilities are available to Bernhard Kleist Von Ennerlund
* Speak to Abigal and Theodora to see if some compromise can be reached; they are prepared to come to [[Anvil]] to speak to the Bearer of the Imperial Wayleave and see if a compromise might be reached.
* Complete the project as a standard sinecure for 30 wains, that will still provide 33 drams of herbs each season with an emphasis on [[Bladeroot]], [[Marrowort]], and True Vervain. With the [[Materials]] already provided, this would mean that the gardens were complete and available to be auctioned at the Spring Equinox.
* Build a larger sinecure requiring an additional 15 wains of white granite, 15 wains of weirwood, and 60 crowns that will produce 45 drams, but require at least another three months to complete.
* OOC Note: The player of Bernhard Kleist Von Ennerlund can e-mail PD at plot@profounddecisions.co.uk to let us know which approach they prefer. Otherwise we'll assume they intend to invite Abigal and Theodora to come to Anvil to discuss the issue.
* Once complete Imperial title of ''Tender of Kleist's Winter Gardens'' will be available to be in the [[Auction of the Seats]]
