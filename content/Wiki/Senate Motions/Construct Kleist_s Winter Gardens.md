__NOTOC__
[[Holberg]] Endures! [[Skathe]] the Hag Queen cursed Holmauer Park with [[Winter magic]]. This [[Commission|commission]] builds Kleist's [[Winter]] Gardens at the [[Holberg]] University Duelling Grounds. We can use Marcher menhirs to channel that Winter [[Magic|magic]] to grow [[Herbs|herbs]]. The [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] [[Will|will]] be "Tender of Kleist's Winter Gardens". This title is appointed annually by [[Imperial Bourse]] Auction. This is a well-worn path. We are Kleist von Ennerlund, Vintners and Victuallers of [[Holberg]]. We are self-funding this [[Commission|commission]] to the tune of 15 [[White granite|white granite]], 15 [[Weirwood|weirwood]] and about 25 thrones. Auctioning it brings coin into [[The Senate|the Senate]] budget. We support our Empire becausae we are [[League]], and for the benefit of our beloved city [[Holberg]].

## Outcome
The [[Opportunity]] this [[Commission|commission]] required that "''The title could be appointed by the senators of [[The League|the League]], or perhaps assigned by the [[Business|business]] owners of [[The League|the League]] via the [[Imperial Bourse]]''." As things stand, Abigal and Theodora are not prepared to offer their [[Assistance|assistance]] to build the gardens as an Imperial position. Three possibilities are available to Bernhard Kleist Von Ennerlund
* Speak to Abigal and Theodora to see if some compromise can be reached; they are prepared to come to [[Anvil]] to speak to the Bearer of the Imperial Wayleave and see if a compromise might be reached.
* Complete the project as a standard [[Sinecure|sinecure]] for 30 wains, that [[Will|will]] still provide 33 drams of herbs each season with an emphasis on [[Bladeroot]], [[Marrowort]], and [[True Vervain]]. With the [[Materials|materials]] already provided, this would mean that the gardens were complete and available to be auctioned at the [[Spring]] Equinox.
* Build a larger [[Sinecure|sinecure]] requiring an additional 15 wains of [[White granite|white granite]], 15 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], and 60 crowns that [[Will|will]] produce 45 drams, but require at least another three months to complete.
* OOC Note: The player of Bernhard Kleist Von Ennerlund can e-mail PD at plot@profounddecisions.co.uk to let us know which approach they prefer. Otherwise we'll assume they intend to invite Abigal and Theodora to come to [[Anvil]] to discuss the issue.
* Once complete [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] of ''Tender of Kleist's Winter Gardens'' [[Will|will]] be available to be in the [[Auction of the Seats]]
