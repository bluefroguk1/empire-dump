Delegates who arrive on the field at [[Anvil]] under the flag of peace and are unarmed should have protection under the law.
''Proposed by [[Miaren]], seconded by [[Therunin]]''
### Overview
* Extending the protection of the [[Imperial Law]] to peaceful delegations would essentially grant them the rights and responsibilities of foreigners.
