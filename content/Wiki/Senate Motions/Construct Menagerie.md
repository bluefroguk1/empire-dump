__NOTOC__
Create an Imperial Menagerie in Holmauer, Holberg to house the tame rakshasa gifted to the Empress Lisabetta by the Eastern Principalities of Jarm. This enclosure for the rakshasa named 'Flocki' by the children of Holberg will provide a suitable environment for the housing of this unique creature and will ensure a regular bounty of Winter Vis, and the substance known as 'Tears of the Rakshasa', produced when the creature is happy. Self-funded by the House of Seven Mirrors.
The Menagerie will be managed by the 'Keeper of the Imperial Menagerie', a lifetime appointment made by The Throne and revocable by the General Assembly and Assembly of Nine.
