__NOTOC__
Create an Imperial Menagerie in Holmauer, [[Holberg]] to house the tame rakshasa gifted to the [[Empress Lisabetta]] by the Eastern [[Principalities of Jarm]]. This enclosure for the rakshasa named 'Flocki' by the children of Holberg will provide a suitable environment for the housing of this unique creature and will ensure a regular bounty of Winter [[Vis]], and the substance known as 'Tears of the Rakshasa', produced when the creature is happy. Self-funded by the House of Seven Mirrors.
The Menagerie will be managed by the '[[Keeper of the Imperial Menagerie]]', a lifetime [[Appointment]] made by [[The Throne]] and revocable by the [[General]] [[Assembly]] and Assembly of Nine.
