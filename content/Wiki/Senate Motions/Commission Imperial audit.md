### Constitution
The [[Imperial treasury]] that is made available to the [[Senate]] is what remains from taxation and auctions in the [[Imperial Bourse]] after appropriate deductions to meet the running costs of [[The Empire|the Empire]] are removed. The [[Master of the Imperial Mint]] receives a breakdown of income and expenditure for [[The Empire|the Empire]] which includes outgoings for [[Imperial armies]], [[Fortifications]], stipends, running costs for any [[Great work]] that require them and the costs to administer the territories of the Empire. The Senate has the ability to curtail most of these outgoings by abrogating past motions, demobilizing armies and dismantling existing fortifications and great works but they cannot change the Empire's territorial administration costs, these are fixed.
### Notes
The level of detail provided in information available to the Master of the Mint and the Senate is set by the limits for [[Abstraction]] in [[The game|the game]].
A detailed breakdown of all the administrative costs involved in administering the Empire would run to several hundred pages and more. All these costs are fixed, in effect they are "below our [[Abstraction|abstraction]] layer", so changing the administrative costs of the Empire is completely outside the remit of [[The game|the game]]. It is not part of the game design for PC senators to spend hours examining the number of chickens bought to feed the third regiment of the [[Granite Pillar|Granite pillar]] over a six week period to see if savings could be made by using more chicken legs and less chicken breasts. As a result we don't intend to provide this superfluous information as it would take hours to manufacture it, hours to read it and the answer to every single question of "''Can we change this?''" would be "''No''".
It's perfectly within the parameters of the game for the Senate to bypass the power of the Master of the Mint if they are prepared to pay to do so, but not to try to change the nature of the game from one of politics, economics and [[War|war]] to a game of accountancy and efficiency savings.
