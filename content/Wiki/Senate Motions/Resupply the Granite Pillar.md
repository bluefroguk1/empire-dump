### Constitution
When no limitations are placed on the extent or duration of Senate authorization to resupply an army, the assumption is that the maximum possible limits apply; the senator may supply any amount of mithril or weirwood up to a year after the motion is passed.
The [[Imperial Military Council]] do not require authorization to use any resources they possess - any property held by them can be disposed of as the Council chooses. Resupplying an army does require the authorization of the Senate, but once granted they cannot specify how that resupply should take place.
