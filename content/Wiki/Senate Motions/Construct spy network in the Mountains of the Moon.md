* Due to the [[Grendel]] and [[Druj]] occupation of [[Zenith]] and [[Spiral]] no progress was made on this [[Commission]] after the Winter Solstice 381YE.
* With the conquest of Ossuary in [[Spiral]], [[The Empire|the Empire]] now has access to the target territory again and if nothing changes work [[Will|will]] be completed shortly before the [[Summer]] Solstice.
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* A [[Spy network|spy network]] [[Will|will]] be constructed in the territory known as the [[Mountains of the Moon]].

* There may be problems with this construction given [[The Empire|the Empire]] currently has no regions or indeed territories bordering the [[Mountains of the Moon]].
