__NOTOC__
To construct a [[Spy network]] in the area known as the Valley of the Moon, known as the Valley of Silence in [[Axos]].
Proposed by [[Casinea]], seconded by [[Redoubt]]. Passed.
### Overview
* To construct a Spy network in the Territory to the east of [[Zenith]] known as the "[[Mountains of the Moon]]".
* Passed
### Date
* Winter 381YE
### [[Cost]]
* Standard costs apply.
* [[Materials]]: 10 [[Weirwood]].
* Time: 3 months to construct.
* Labour: 2 crowns per wain
* Upkeep: 2 Thrones per season.
### PrOgress
* 10 wains of weirwood and 20 crowns provided by Nira of Cantiarch's Hold after Winter Solstice 381YE.
* Due to the [[Grendel]] and [[Druj]] occupation of Zenith and [[Spiral]] no progress was made on this Commission after the Winter Solstice 381YE.
* With the conquest of Ossuary in Spiral, [[The Empire]] now has access to the target territory again and if nothing changes work will be completed shortly before the Summer Solstice.
### Campaign Outcome
* A spy network will be constructed in the territory known as the Mountains of the Moon.
* Work cannot begin on this commission until the Empire controls a Region adjacent to the territory. These regions include Lustri, Occursion, Ossuary, or Apstrus.
* The spy network was completed shortly before the beginning of the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* Following Summer 382YE, a significant force of scouts supported the spy network, and uncovered extensive details of the Mountains of the Moon and some information about the [[Tsark]] folk who live there.
## Constitution
* The Mountains of the Moon are an independent territory - they are not part of Axos.
* There may be problems with this construction given the Empire currently has no regions or indeed territories bordering the Mountains of the Moon.
