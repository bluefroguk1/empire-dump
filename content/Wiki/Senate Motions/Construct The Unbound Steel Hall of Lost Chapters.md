__NOTOC__
We are going to build a Pride museum in Tabernacle, in Reikos.
It will be called “The Unbound Steel Hall of Lost Chapters”
We are going to do this because it will attract many pilgrims to the area increasing the Prosperity of Reikos.
This great work is also expected to increase the Pride congregations across the territory.
