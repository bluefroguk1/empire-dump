We are going to build a [[Pride]] museum in Tabernacle, in [[Reikos]].
It will be called “The Unbound Steel Hall of Lost Chapters”
We are going to do this because it will attract many pilgrims to the area increasing the [[Prosperity]] of Reikos.
This [[Great work]] is also expected to increase the Pride Congregations across the territory.
