We should give official [[Recognition]] to the [[Loyalty]] of those [[Military unit]] commanders who commit their troops to support our armies in the field. We suggest a roll of honour be posted each season listing those who have aided each campaign.
''Proposed by [[Kallavesa]], seconded by [[Astolat]].''
## Spring 377YE
### Overview
* A public record of military units aiding Imperial armies to be produced and made public.
* Passed unanimously.
### [[Cost]]
* The Civil Service compiles this information for the benefit of the Military Council; as such additional costs involved in creating an additional copy for purposes of the roll of honour are negligible.
### PrOgress
* Imperial Roll of Honour created.
### Campaign Outcome
When the civil servants compile lists of recent military campaigns for the Military Council, an additional copy of the information will be made and disseminated via the Hub.
It is [[Worth]] noting that if this information were not already being compiled, or if many additional copies were required, the costs would likely be significantly higher.
## Winter 377YE
That the Roll Of Honour defined in Senate sessions passim is available in the Imperial Public Library for all citizens to see.
''Proposed by [[Hahnmark]], seconded by [[Volodmartz]].''
