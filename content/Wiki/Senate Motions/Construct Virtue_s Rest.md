__NOTOC__
to create the [[Great work]] called “Virtue’s Rest”, based upon the plans for the Pilgrim’s Road hostelry drawn up by Philemon of Fulmon’s Bounty. This will create a network of seven hostels, one dedicated to each Virtue. These hostels will provide plans of safety and rest for all pilgrims on their PilgriPilgrimage to and from the white city. This Opportunity will only be available while Philemon of Fulmon’s Bounty has the interest and support of the local populace. The [[Cost]] will be 100 wains of [[White granite]] and 25 Thrones and will be self funded by the citizens of [[Highguard]].''Proposed by [[Bastion]], seconded by [[Bregasland]].''

## Campaign Outcome
* When complete, the great work will provide a bounty of 50 [[Liao]] and 100 Synod votes spread between every [[Congregation]] in Bastion. 
* Philemon is absolutely clear that he will not permit that "League montebanc" anywhere near this grand scheme.
* The hostels are designed to go all along the proposed Blood Red Roads. While this great work can be built at any time it will only provide half the expected benefits above unless the Blood Red Roads or similar are extended to Bastion.
