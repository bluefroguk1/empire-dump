__NOTOC__
to create the Great Work called “Virtue’s Rest”, based upon the plans for the Pilgrim’s Road hostelry drawn up by Philemon of Fulmon’s Bounty. This will create a network of seven hostels, one dedicated to each Virtue. These hostels will provide plans of safety and rest for all pilgrims on their pilgrimage to and from the white city. This opportunity will only be available while Philemon of Fulmon’s Bounty has the interest and support of the local populace. The cost will be 100 wains of white granite and 25 Thrones and will be self funded by the citizens of Highguard.''Proposed by Bastion, seconded by Bregasland.''

* 50 wains of white granite and 100 crowns provided by Rhesa of the Scions of Ravenfell after the Summer Solstice 383YE.
## Campaign Outcome
* When complete, the great work will provide a bounty of 50 liao and 100 Synod votes spread between every congregation in Bastion. 
* Philemon is absolutely clear that he will not permit that "League montebanc" anywhere near this grand scheme.
* The hostels are designed to go all along the proposed [[Lorenzo's Legacy#Blood Red Roads|Blood Red Roads]]. While this great work can be built at any time it will only provide half the expected benefits above unless the Blood Red Roads or similar are extended to Bastion.
* The hostels provide the full benefits above following the completion of the [[384YE Summer Solstice Senate sessions#Construct White Roads|White Roads]] shortly before the Winter Solstice 384YE.
