__NOTOC__
To disburse funds for and rebuild Atalaya Harbour to permit it to cheaply upgrade [[Freeborn]] fleets. This [[Will|will]] not count as a [[Shipyard|shipyard]].
## Overview
* Constructs the Atalaya Harbour  as detailed in the [[The power behind our moves]] wind of fortune.
* Passed
## Date
* [[Winter]] 384YE
## [[Cost]]
* As per the wind of fortune
* 10 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]]
* 20 wains of [[White granite|white granite]]
* 60 crowns in labour costs
* Upkeep is 5 thrones a season
## Progress
CommissionProgress|Freeborn_Flame_Marina
## Outcome
*  Once complete the facilities would be perfect for building and upgrading Imperial fleets, allowing any Freeborn [[Fleet|fleet]] based out of [[Madruga]] to be upgraded each season for one less [[Weirwood|weirwood]] than is usually required.
* The [[Grendel]] cannot legitimately claim that the docks breach the existing treaty, but they are aware of the threat the shipyards pose
* The docks could be quickly and cheaply expanded later to include a fully functional  [[Shipyard]]. Such an expansion would only require 10 wains of [[White granite|white granite]], 10 wains of weirwood and 20 crowns. While it would take 3 months to complete, the existing facilities would be good enough to start work on a navy at the same time as the shipyard was being built, saving precious time.
* These benefits would last for as long as the new arrivals continue to live in [[Madruga]]. Once [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] reclaims [[Feroz]], many of the new arrivals [[Will|will]] look to return home. If that happens, then the shipyards would no longer have enough shipwrights to reduce the upgrade costs for Madruga fleets. At that point the only benefit would be to convert them into a regular shipyard as described above.
