__NOTOC__
To ratify a treaty with Salt Lord Kaliact.
## Outcome
* This motion was presented as a treaty by the [[Ambassador to the Grendel]]
* Failed
## Date
* Winter 384YE
## Treaty
Civil service records indicate the following points were agreed in the treaty with the [[Grendel]].
There will be peace between [[The Empire]] and those Grendel residing in, or operating from, [[Spiral]] for a period of three years, this is to be renegotiated after two years; should either side wish to end the contract at this two year period - a break clause of 50 [[Mithril]] will be paid by the party that wishes to enact the break clause.
Spiral will remain uncontested territory. No imperial forces will enter the territory without leaving from Salt Lord Kaliact.
No Grendel forces will move through Spiral into Imperial land, as understood of 384 Winter, no forces directly under the control of Salt Lord Kaliact, or any of her people, will attack Imperial territory as per above.
Salt Lord Kaliact, and all who dwell within, or operate from, the territory of Spiral, shall not trade with the [[Druj]] nor offer them any material Assistance in their campaign against the Empire, without Imperial leave.
No party involved in this treaty will engage in raiding against the other party.
Any altercations between citizens of either parties shall be dealt with in the first instance by the representatives of the parties rather than be considered an automatic breach of the treaty.
The north mareave trading consortium will offer improved rates on several resources for the duration of this treaty.
Salt Lord Kaliact will provide a ritual text to speed up fort construction after two seasons of the agreement being in effect and 10 wains of mithril after one year from the start of this treaty.
Under this treaty, the treatment of law abiding Imperial citizens of spiral will remain the same as under the current treaty, or the citizens will be permitted to leave should this change.
This treaty will go into effect if either: 
* the existing treaty, as it stands on this date, is not renewed
* representatives for both parties agree, in the wake of a new treaty with the Grendel and Empire being agreed that varies its current terms; to activate this treaty.
## Campaign Outcome
* The treaty was rejected by the Senate
## Constitution
While the treaty was rejected, the Constitutional Court has some additional commentary specifically regarding the final clause "''representatives for both parties agree, in the wake of a new treaty with the Grendel and Empire being agreed that varies its current terms; to activate this treaty''" has significant implications. Following some discussion, Chief Magistrate Karkovitch expressed the opinion that the only way that a clause such as this could work without "binding the hands of a future Senate" would be if the [[Ambassador]] to the Grendel were given the power to announce a treaty. That is, they would need the power to present a treaty themselves that would immediately go into effect (unless Vetoed by the Synod) without an Opportunity for the Senate to vote on it. As the treaty was rejected, however, the discussion was curtailed. The decision was made to make this concern clear, however, in the hope of guiding future discussion around treaties.
