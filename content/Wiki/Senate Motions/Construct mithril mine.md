Proposed by [[Sermersuaq]], Seconded by [[Mitwold]] 
### Overview

### Date
* [[Winter]] 379YE
### [[Cost]]
* The [[Senator]] may choose either of the options presented by the Civil Service.
** ''either'' 100 Thrones, 6 months to construct, 10 wains each season projected production.
** ''or'' 200 Thrones, 9 months to construct, 15 wains each season projected production.
### Progress
* 330 Thrones disbursed to [[Senator]] Sermersuaq
* 200 Thrones supplied by Atte Arrow-Tongue Metsastajason, Senator for Sermersuaq.
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* Once the [[Mine|mine]] is complete, it [[Will|will]] create a new seat on the [[Imperial Bourse]]. 
* When it produces its first load of [[Mithril|mithril]], a senator [[Will|will]] be able to propose a motion to allocate the seat as either National or Imperial.
* As 200 Thrones have been committed to the project, the mithril mine will take nine months to complete, meaning that unless something goes wrong it will be available for allocation at the [[Autumn]] Equinox 380YE.
