After due consideration it is clear that the College of the Liberated is legal, provided it is made clear to the newly arrived Jarmish foreigners that they are under no obligation to remain in Sarvos or to participate in the education provided by the College. If the College is ever in a position where there are more spaces than there are former slaves, then it is anticipated that they could fill their ranks from the orphans and poor of Sarvos.
