Meryl of [[Navarr]] to be given permission to scout then dredge for [[Materials|materials]] in Feverwater.Proposed by [[Therunin]], seconded by [[Miaren]].'' 
### Overview
* Attempt to dredge the Feverwater, a lake partially in [[Therunin]] using riverboats
* Passed by 26 votes to 1.
### Date
* Passed [[Summer]] 377YE (Event Three 2013).
### [[Cost]]
* At least 10+ [[Weirwood]] - difficult to estimate. 
### Progress
* 13 wains of [[Weirwood]] paid by Merel, of the Pathfinders of Therunin, [[Navarr]] after the [[Spring]] Equinox.
### Production
* None expected. The dredging of the Feverwater has produced some small wealth in crafting [[Materials|materials]] at a reasonable rate, producing 4 each season. This is considered to be a Navarr National position, and as such voted on by the Navarr Senators.
### Note
* Brass Coast citizens use mundane nets to dredge the Scorrero, no magical netting techniques are known to the civil service. 
* The Feverwater is known to be inhabited by swamp monsters which are likely to kill many Imperial Citizens attempting this. 
* It seems conceptually possible that the apparent madness of this action may cause the [[Druj]] forces active in the area to under-estimate [[The Empire|the Empire]] in some unpredictable way.
