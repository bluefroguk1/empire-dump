### Overview
* This motion has constitutional implications
* The motion requires ratification by [[The Throne]]
* Passed
* This followed on from a previous motion to amend the powers of the [[Quartermaster General of the Imperial Armies]]
### Date
* [[Summer]] 380YE
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* This motion was ratified by [[Empress Lisabetta]] in Summer 380YE, and the title of [[Quartermaster General of the Imperial Armies]] has been changed
### [[Scrutiny]]
* This motion was ruled by the Constitutional Court to require a constitutional vote - it was duly passed by the [[Senate]] and ratified by [[The Throne]].
* As the motion requires announcement in the [[Imperial Senate]], it is subject to [[Veto]] by the [[Imperial Synod]] as if it were any other announcement.
* This motion [[Will|will]] not pass [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]] without any accompanying change in the method of [[Appointment|appointment]].
This motion required ratification by the Senate as it was judged to represent a considerable shift in power ''from'' individual nations and their generals ''to'' the [[Imperial Military Council]].
Existing powers of the [[Military Council]] do not require announcement in the Senate - but this power is a significant new extension of the powers of [[The Military|the Military]] council. Having the announcement take place in the Senate ensures greater public awareness and will mean that the announcement is subject to [[Veto|veto]] by the [[Imperial Synod]].
In the final process of scrutiny, it was identified that the [[Appointment|appointment]] of the Quartermaster [[General]] could fall within the provenance of the Senate rather than the Military Council - due to the appointment method for this [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] which allowed for input from both houses. As a result, the motion was ruled unconstitutional - with the recommendation to raise an [[Administrative motion|administrative motion]] to change the method of appointment of the Quartermaster General - to be by majority vote of the Military Council. If this administrative motion is passed by the [[Imperial Senate]] - then the motion will pass into [[Law|law]].
*The administrative motion to amend the method of appointment of the Quartermaster General passed.
