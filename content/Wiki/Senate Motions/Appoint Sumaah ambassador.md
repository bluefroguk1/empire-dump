To assign an [[Ambassador]] to the [[Sumaah]] RepublicProposed by [[Miaren]], seconded by [[Zenith]] 
### Overview
* This motion was to choose a citizen to appoint as [[Ambassador to the Sumaah Republic]].
* This motion was raised at the last [[Senate session]] of the summit so, following the method for elections within the Senate, the elections took place at the first senate session of the Winter Solstice 379YE.
### Date
* Autumn 379YE.
### Campaign Outcome
* The actual [[Appointment]] took place during the Winter 379YE summit, but ultimately no candidate received the backing of the senate and so the title remained vacant.
* With the completion of the Sumaah [[Embassy]] in [[Necropolis]], the Senate will have another administrative [[Opportunity]] to appoint an ambassador during Spring 380YE.
