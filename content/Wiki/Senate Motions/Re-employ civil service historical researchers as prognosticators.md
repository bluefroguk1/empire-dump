__NOTOC__
The senate proposes to divert all Civil Service resources from [[Historical research]] to prognostication. Instead of funding civil servants to conduct investigations and field work that risk putting them in harmâ€™s way, they will be tasked to do all they can to identify [[Sentinel Gate]] [[Conjunctions]] aligned with areas of interest defined by the senate, or other suitably appointed bodies. 
Proposed by [[Sarvos]], Seconded by [[Tassato]].
