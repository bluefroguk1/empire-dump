## PrOgress

## Outcome
* Establishes a port town in Ossium, on the shores of The Semmerlak, named ''Kostjyas Respite''. 
* The [[Opportunity]] specifies the town will occupy the same cove that the [[Druj]] launched rafts from to attack [[Semmerholm]] during the reign of [[Empress Varkula]]
* Once completed, the port on the Bittershore will remove the under-developed quality from the Region of Bittershore
* It will also create an [[Imperial Title]] - ''Merchant-boyar of Bittershore''
* The well worn path to elect such a title would be either [[Appointment by the Senate]] or through the Bourse via [[Tally of the Votes]], as decided by the bearer of the Imperial Wayleave 
* The title would serve for a year, receive access to a ministry allowing the purchase or measures, herbs and mana crystals, and have responsibility for ensuring the [[Prosperity]] of the new port.
* ''Kostjyas Respite'' will increase the taxation to the [[Imperial treasury]] by 20 Thrones per season, spread between the territories on the Semmerlak.
* The new port town will create new opportunities once work was complete. Options will be presented to expand the docks at Lacre in Semmerholm; at Korotny in [[Karov]]; and at Ivarsgard in [[Karsk]]. There would even be a possibility to create a similar dock in Misericorde or Utterlund, allowing the wealth of [[Holberg]] to spread across the Semmerlak.
