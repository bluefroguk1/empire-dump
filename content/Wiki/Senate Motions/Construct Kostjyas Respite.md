* Once completed, the port on the Bittershore [[Will|will]] remove the under-developed quality from the region of Bittershore
* It [[Will|will]] also create an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] - ''Merchant-[[Boyar|boyar]] of Bittershore''
* The well worn path to elect such a title would be either [[Appointment by the Senate|appointment by the Senate]] or through [[The Bourse|the Bourse]] via [[Tally of the Votes]], as decided by the bearer of the Imperial Wayleave 
* The title would serve for a year, receive access to a [[Ministry|ministry]] allowing the purchase or measures, [[Herbs|herbs]] and mana crystals, and have responsibility for ensuring the [[Prosperity|prosperity]] of the new port.
* ''Kostjyas Respite'' [[Will|will]] increase the taxation to the [[Imperial treasury]] by 20 Thrones per season, spread between the territories on [[The Semmerlak|the Semmerlak]].
* The new port town will create new [[Opportunities|opportunities]] once work was complete.

There would even be a possibility to create a similar dock in Misericorde or Utterlund, allowing the wealth of [[Holberg]] to spread across [[The Semmerlak|the Semmerlak]].
