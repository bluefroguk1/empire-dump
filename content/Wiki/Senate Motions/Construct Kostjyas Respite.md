__NOTOC__
I am Kostjya of Cabal Lyktan and the Wulfen Reavers, holder of an Imperial Wayleave announce that Cabal Lyktan and the people of Varushka will fully self fund and build the ministry on the Bittershore, the port, the town of "Kostjyas Respite" and the national title, appointed by the well worn path, of "Merchant Boyar of the Bittershore".

## Progress
CommissionProgress|Kostjyas_Respite
## Outcome
* Establishes a port town in [[Ossium]], on the shores of [[The Semmerlak]], named ''Kostjyas Respite''. 
* The opportunity specifies the town will occupy the same cove that the Druj launched rafts from to attack Semmerholm during the reign of [[Empress Varkula]]
* Once completed, the port on the Bittershore will remove the [[Ossium#Under-developed|under-developed]] quality from the region of [[Ossium#Bittershore|Bittershore]]
* It will also create an Imperial title - ''Merchant-boyar of Bittershore''
* The well worn path to elect such a title would be either appointment by the Senate or through the Bourse via [[Tally of the Votes]], as decided by the bearer of the Imperial Wayleave 
* The title would serve for a year, receive access to a ministry allowing the purchase or measures, herbs and mana crystals, and have responsibility for ensuring the prosperity of the new port.
* ''Kostjyas Respite'' will increase the taxation to the Imperial treasury by 20 Thrones per season, spread between the territories on the Semmerlak.
* The new port town will create new opportunities once work was complete. Options will be presented to expand the docks at Lacre in Semmerholm; at Korotny in Karov; and at Ivarsgard in Karsk. There would even be a possibility to create a similar dock in Misericorde or Utterlund, allowing the wealth of Holberg to spread across the Semmerlak.
