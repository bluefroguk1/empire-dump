## Date
* Spring 382YE

* 240 crowns labour costs
* 6 months to construct.
## PrOgress
* 40 wains of White Granite received from Thanmir Hrafnar after the Spring Equinox 382YE.
* 20 wains of Mithril and 13 Thrones received from Ariadne after the Spring Equinox 382YE.
* 24 white granite, 20 mithril, and 13 Thrones received from Edmundo of Damakan's Forge after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
