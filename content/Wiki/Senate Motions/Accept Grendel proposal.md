After this, further negotiations may occur with this Salt Lord and/or others.Proposed by [[Kahraman]], Seconded by [[Feroz]].
### Overview
* An [[Ambassador]] from the Grendel Salt Lord of Dubhtraig presented an agreement to the [[Imperial Senate]]. This is a formal acceptance of that agreement but is not a change to the law.
### Date

### Constitution
* This is not a legal restriction, but a [[Statement of Principle]] by the Imperial Senate.
* The Grendel remain barbarians, and raiding their Fleets remains perfectly legal.
