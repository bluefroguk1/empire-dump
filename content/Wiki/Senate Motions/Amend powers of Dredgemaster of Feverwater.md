## Constitution

### Usage
While the Dredgemaster has the ability to commission Historical Research, [[The Empire]] as a whole can still only commission a limited number each season. To use this power, the Dredgemaster provides an announcement to the Civil Service, who presents the decision to the Imperial Senate. No voting is possible by the Senate at this point, as the power has been delegated to the Dredgemaster. The [[Imperial Synod]] may, however, choose to exercise their [[Veto]] over this announcement.
### Tenure
The ability to commission historical research is a significant power. Other similar titles with this power are appointed annually. To bring this position into line with existing titles, the Court have recommended that it be amended to be appointed annually.
