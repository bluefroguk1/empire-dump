### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* When the The Printer's Guild Museum of Wonders was completed, it  automatically created the title "Curator of the Printer's Guild Museum".
* The constitutional issues that dogged this title were resolved during the [[Autumn]] 379YE summit.
Voting in [[The Synod|the Synod]] [[Will|will]] be performed by such assemblies as are rightfully able to weigh the virtue of an action or individual, in accord with their [[Nationality|nationality]] and authority.
### Constitution
* Sinecures are usually life-time appointments, but virtue appointments are normally available to be reappointed if a new [[Cardinal|cardinal]] is elected. The [[Senator]] for Tassato [[Will|will]] need to provide these necessary details.
* It is unconstitutional for an Imperial citizen to vote in a [[Virtue assembly|virtue assembly]] unless they are a member of that [[Assembly|assembly]]. A sinecure that provides votes in the [[Synod]] or in senatorial or [[Bourse|bourse]] elections must provide those votes for all situations where they are relevant.
In its original form, this motion was unconstitutional because it provided the potential for an Imperial citizen to vote in a virtue assembly when they were not dedicated to that virtue. In addition a sinecure that provides votes in the Synod should provide votes in all relevant assemblies. After discussion with the [[Senator|senator]] for Tassato, the Constitutional court recommended that the motion be modified as follows.
### Amendment
* The sinecure is a lifetime appointed by the current [[Cardinal of Prosperity]]
* The sinecure will provide votes in the appropriate assemblies based on the [[Nationality|nationality]] and virtue of the recipient
These amendments were agreed by [[The Senate|the Senate]] during the Autumn Equinox 379YE summit.
