__NOTOC__
To grant permission to [[Asavea]] to build a major temple in [[Feroz]], to their gods. Under the understanding that it is for the usage of Non-Imperial citizens only.
Proposed by [[Kahraman]], seconded by [[Madruga]] 
### Overview
* Passed
### Date
* [[Spring]] 380YE
### [[Cost]]
* Time : 6 months to construct
### Progress
* The Asaveans have begun work on constructing this temple in the bustling port-town of Oran, on the northern coast of [[Feroz]]. Further details about how this [[Will|will]] work can be found here.
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* When complete, the Temple of Balo and the Black Bull [[Will|will]] create a non-[[Imperial Title]] responsible for liasing with the temple priests. The Asaveans have indicated that they will be guided in this [[Appointment|appointment]] by the temporal power of the area the temple has been built - in this case the decision of the [[Senator]] for Feroz. The [[Imperial Synod]] will have no ability to revoke this title; rather the Asavean priesthood will have the ability to refuse to deal with their liason effectively removing them from their position.
* Work has begun on building the major temple and it is believed it will be completed shortly before the [[Autumn]] Equinox 380YE.
* Due to significant delays fostered by the interference of the [[Imperial Synod]], the temple will be completed shortly before the Spring Equinox 381YE.
