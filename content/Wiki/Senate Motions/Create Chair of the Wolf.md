__NOTOC__
  Motion to give the Holberg Guild of Engineers the permission to expand their premises. This will create the Imperial title "Chair of the Wolf". It will have the power to announce a commission that takes place entirely in the League. This commission can be either a great work, ministry, sinecure, or folly. This will be a League national position appointed by Tally of the Votes.
