The Spider's Dream bridge is in a sorry state of repair. I ask for funds towards the fixing of the bridge
''Proposed by Madruga, seconded by Feroz.''
### Overview
* The [[Madruga#Spider's Dream|Spider's Dream bridge]] that links [[Sarvos]] and [[Madruga]] is in a poor state of repair.
* Passed at 15 Thrones with 3 votes against, money distributed to Madruga.
### Date
* Passed Spring 377YE (Event Two 2013).
### Cost
* 20 wains of weirwood.
### Progress
* 20 wains of weirwood provided by Avisena i Ezmara i Guerra (Senator for [[Madruga]])
* The project is complete
### Production
* If the bridge is restored to full operation, the [[Spider's Tollkeep]] sinecure would be reinstated.
Restoring the bridge allows for the reinstatement of the Spider's Tollkeep [[Sinecure]]. This sinecure provides a portion of the money raised in tolls, and the holder of the title is decided by unanimous decision of the Senators of the Brass Coast and the League. The holder of the sinecure receives 2 Thrones every season. The sinecure lapsed entirely during the reign of [[Emperor Walter]] as the poor condition of the bridge has made it impossible to provide any money to the holder. Recent repairs have re-instated the sinecure, which is currently vacant.
