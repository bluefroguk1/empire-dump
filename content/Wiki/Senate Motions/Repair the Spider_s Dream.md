[[The Spider]]'s Dream bridge is in a sorry state of repair. I ask for funds towards the fixing of the bridge
''Proposed by [[Madruga]], seconded by [[Feroz]].''
### Overview
* The Spider's Dream bridge that links [[Sarvos]] and [[Madruga]] is in a poor state of repair.
* Passed at 15 Thrones with 3 votes against, money distributed to Madruga.
### Date
* Passed [[Spring]] 377YE (Event Two 2013).
### [[Cost]]
* 20 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]].
### Progress
* 20 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]] provided by Avisena i Ezmara i [[Guerra]] ([[Senator]] for Madruga)
* The project is complete
### Production
* If the bridge is restored to full operation, the Spider's Tollkeep [[Sinecure|sinecure]] would be reinstated.
Restoring the bridge allows for the reinstatement of the Spider's Tollkeep [[Sinecure]]. This sinecure provides a portion of the money raised in tolls, and the holder of the title is decided by unanimous decision of the Senators of [[The Brass Coast|the Brass Coast]] and [[The League|the League]]. The holder of the sinecure receives 2 Thrones every season. The sinecure lapsed entirely during the reign of [[Emperor Walter]] as the poor condition of the bridge has made it impossible to provide any money to the holder. Recent repairs have re-instated the sinecure, which is currently vacant.
