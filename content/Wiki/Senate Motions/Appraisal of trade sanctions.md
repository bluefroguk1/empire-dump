## Constitution
As the first official Appraisal, there was some irregularity in how this motion, and the other two proposed appraisals, were dealt with. Going forWard, while it is likely the Speaker will arrange a single debate on all appraisals proposed during a session, they will then be voted on in sequence rather than concurrently.
