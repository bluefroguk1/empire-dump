__NOTOC__

## Constitution
As the first official [[Appraisal]], there was some irregularity in how this motion, and the other two proposed appraisals, were dealt with. Going forward, while it is likely the Speaker will arrange a single debate on all appraisals proposed during a session, they will then be voted on in sequence rather than concurrently.
