## Outcome
* Once complete, the benefits would primarily be felt in Mitwold and Mournwold. Every [[Business|business]] in each [[Territory|territory]] would receive a share of 560 rings; every [[Farm|farm]] in Mitwold would receive a share of 220 rings (on top of that provided by the Breadbasket); and every [[Mine|mine]] in the Mournwold would share additional production equal to 50 ingots of metal.
* It would also link the two most prosperous settlements in [[The Marches|the Marches]] - Sarcombe and Meade.
* The [[Mournwold thralls]] have thrown their support behind this project and between donations of money and food, and actual physical labour, they have contributed half the labour costs (100 crowns). 
* The presence of the orcs working alongside the human Marchers on the riverways would also cause them to become more familiar to the people of the northern [[Marches]].
