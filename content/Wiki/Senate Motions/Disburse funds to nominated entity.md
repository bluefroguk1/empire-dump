Disbursal of 200 thrones to a nominated entity, with the intention that it be used to pay wages and upkeep in the event of imperial deficit, and that the remaining be repaid to [[Senate|senate]] funds in one year.Proposed by [[Astolat]], seconded by [[Tassato]].
### Overview
* Attempt to create a loan to a nominated individual from [[The Senate|the senate]] treasury.
* Defeated
### Date
* [[Spring]] 378YE
### Constitution
It is not possible for the [[Imperial Senate]] to act as creditor to a loan, but it may disburse funds to a [[Senator|senator]] who could then enter into a loan agreement which would be legally binding. However the Senate cannot set terms for how a disbursement must be used - nor even create a legal requirement for it to be repaid.
