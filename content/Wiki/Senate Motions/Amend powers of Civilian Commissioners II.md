__NOTOC__
To amend the title of [[Civilian Commissioner]] such that they can only announce five commissions per summit.
Proposed by [[Tassato]], Seconded by [[Mitwold]]
### Overview
* This motion was to amend the previous motion to create the title of [[Civilian Commissioner]] so that the collective ten Civilian Commissioners can only announce up to five constructions per summit
* This motion followed on from a previous motion to amend the powers of the Civilian Commissioners to remove their power to announce the construction of follies
* Passed
### Date
* [[Autumn]] 380YE
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* There are significant  constitutional implications to this motion - it is currently undergoing [[Scrutiny]].
### Constitution
Citizens shall not hold more than one high office at a time and must exercise their powers in person; those whose virtue causes them to be offered numerous Imperial titles must choose between them
* It is not constitutional to share a power between Imperial titles in this way. Either the [[Civilian Commissioner|civilian commissioner]] has the power of [[Commission|commission]] or they do not - it is not possible to make the use of a power contingent on the actions of another title in this way. The use of a power by an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] may be limited by practical or logistical considerations - but it cannot be subject to legal limitations in this way.
Members of the constitutional court [[Will|will]] make themselves available to [[The Senate|the Senate]] on Saturday afternoon at the next summit to offer any help they can to allow senators to craft a constitutional solution to their current problem.
