__NOTOC__
To restore the Basilica of the Seven Doors, with the aid of the Custodes Clavium. This will formally create the title ‘[[Speaker of the Highborn Assembly]]’, and act as a [[Sinecure]] granting a [[Congregation]] to the holder. This will be appointed during the Winter Solstice due to special request, and will be appointed by the Highborn National [[Assembly]]. Due to the aid of the Custodes Clavium, it will not require a civil service Commission slot, and the [[Cost]] is being met entirely by the Custodes Clavium and the Benefactors of [[Highguard]]; as such, it is self-funded.
