To build a suitably virtuous Shrine to celebrate the life and Achievement of [[Empress Britta]] in the [[Kallavesi]] Marshes.
Proposed by [[Hahnmark]], Seconded by [[Reikos]] 
### Overview
* A [[Sinecure|sinecure]] in the [[Kallavesa]] Marsh in [[Kallavesa]] which provides [[Liao|liao]] and votes in the [[Imperial Synod]]
* Passed in principle
* Passed at 75 Thrones
* This is to capitalise on the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to build a shrine to [[Empress Britta]] after their regalia was interred in the marshes of [[Kallavesa]]
### Date
* [[Winter]] 379YE
### [[Cost]]
* The [[Senator]] may choose either of the options provided by the Civil Service.
** A ''modest'' shrine, appropriate for pilgrims to pay their respects, would require 10 wains of [[White granite|white granite]] and [[Cost|cost]] 20 crowns in labour. This would create an [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] who received 7 [[Liao|liao]] and 14 votes in the [[Imperial Synod]].
** A ''major'' shrine, suitable for a large numbers of pilgrims that would also provide places for them to stay and places for meditation, prayer, and religious ceremonies would require 18 wains of [[White granite|white granite]] and 36 crowns in labour. It would provide the [[Imperial Title|Imperial title]] with 9 [[Liao|liao]] and 18 votes in the Imperial [[Synod]], and would be a significant religious structure in [[Kallavesa]].
In both cases, the well worn path for appointing the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] would be for the [[Wintermark]] national [[Assembly|assembly]] to appoint a candidate (one of the Winterfolk), who would likely have lifetime [[Tenure|tenure]].
### Progress
* 75 Thrones disbursed to [[Senator]] [[Hahnmark]]
* 18 wains of [[White granite|white granite]] provided by Hengest Dun after Winter Solstice 379YE.
* 36 crowns provided by Hengest Dun after Winter Solstice 379YE.
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* This shrine is now complete, creating the [[Imperial Title]] of Watcher of Britta's Pool
