That for the next two seasons ([[Spring]] and [[Summer]]) three towns or regions within [[The Empire|the Empire]] to be fortified. The towns or regions to be chosen by the [[Senator]] for [[Upwold]].
''Proposed by [[Upwold]], seconded by [[Sermersuaq]].''
### Overview
* Fortify the towns of [[The Empire|the Empire]].
* Passed at 60 Thrones with 9 votes against, money distributed to [[Upwold]]
### Date
* Passed Spring 377YE (Event Two 2013).
### [[Cost]]
* 600 wains of [[White granite|white granite]]
### Progress
* 39 [[White granite|white granite]] to fortify regions in [[Miaren]], [[Karov]] and [[Semmerholm]].
### Legal Ramifications
* This motion does not follow constitutional protocol
[[Senate Motions|Senate motions]] should only contain a single item. The motion was not struck down by [[Magistrates|magistrates]] at the time and the construction has now begun.
The civil service opinion is that this objective could have been achieved by creating an Imperial position with responsibility for constructing [[Fortifications|fortifications]] in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. This position could have been granted the legal authority to order the [[Fortification|fortification]] of a region and a stipend from the treasury to achieve this.
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* Seren, Delev and Lacre have been partially fortified
Partial [[Fortification|fortification]] does not confer a military advantage. It is sufficient to redress any banditry problems in those areas, but not sufficient to class as a separate [[Fortification|fortification]]. It would require a total of 261 additional wains of [[White granite|white granite]] to complete the three Fortifications.
