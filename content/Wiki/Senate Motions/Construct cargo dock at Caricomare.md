Title: Construct cargo dock at Caricomare
aliases:
- Construct_cargo_dock_at_Caricomare
---
Funds for the purchase of 20 white granite to be used on the construction of a cargo dock in Caricomare which would provide 20 white granite per season (from) the Asaveans (This would create a new Imperial Bourse position)''Proposed by Holberg, seconded by Mitwold'' 
### Overview
* To be constructed in [[Sarvos]], on the [[Caricomare]] docks.
* The production of this [[Ministry]] is unknown.
* When the construction is complete, it will automatically create a new Imperial title.
* The [[New Imperial titles#Well Worn Paths|well worn path]] for appointing the title would be through the [[Imperial Bourse]]; this is clearly an economic position. The method of doing so would be either through open auction if the title were designated as Imperial, or by the [[New Imperial titles#The Imperial Bourse|appropriate method]] for the nation the title is assigned to if it is made National.
* During the Summer Solstice 379YE, the powerful Tarquinius family [[Blue seas, white stone|sent Alonso Tarquinius to Anvil]], with details of the Asavean expectations regarding this project. Those details have not been made general knowledge.
* Shortly before the Spring Equinox 380YE, all progress towards completing the docks was lost in the Grendel invasion.
### Date
* Spring 379YE
### Costs
* 30 wains of weirwood
* 10 wains of white granite
## Progress
* 10 wains of white granite supplied by Ros Jordan after the Summer Solstice 379YE.
* During the [[380YE Spring Equinox winds of war#Salt and Glass|invasion of Sarvos]] by the [[Grendel]], the partially constructed docks were destroyed by orc pillagers. 
### Campaign Outcome
* Once construction is complete, this motion will cause the creation of a new Imperial title, this will be an Imperial Bourse position.
* Any trade with the [[Asavean Archipelago]], especially trade in valuable materials such as white granite, requires the co-operation of Asavean merchants. Without their cooperation, these docks will not provide any special benefit.
* A synod member indicated an intention to raise a [[Veto]]; however, the [[Imperial Synod]] had successfully [[Allocate the Vigilant Swan|used this power]] earlier during the summit so no veto is possible and construction can begin post-haste.
### Constitution
* For the purposes of clarity; this will ''not'' create an additional seat on the Imperial Bourse.
