To repair the pits of Enderlund.Proposed by Sermersuaq, seconded by Mitwold.
### Overview
* The [[Imperial Bourse#The Great Pits of Ennerlund|Great Pits of Ennerlund]] in [[Holberg]] were liberated by Imperial forces.
* The [[Druj]] collapsed the Great Pits in Winter 378YE, and destroyed the pumping mechansisms. In addition to great loss of life, the mineworkings were rendered inoperable.
* Passed at 0 Thrones.
### Date
Spring 379YE
### Costs
* Materials: 250 Thrones
* Time: 9 months
* Upkeep: If the Great Pits are restored, their standard upkeep would apply.
### Progress
* 250 Thrones provided by Bridget Eastville of The Marches after Spring Equinox 379YE.
* The Great Pits were initially predicted to begin producing mithril again after Spring Equinox 380YE, with the first resources being delivered at Summer 380YE. Following the [[Unquiet dead|extensive haunting]] of the mines, this prediction has been pushed back a season; the pits will begin producing mithril again after the Summer Solstice 380YE, with the first mithril received in time for the Autumn Equinox.
### Outstanding
* No more money
* 6 months of work
### Campaign Outcome
* At the moment the Great Pits are producing no mithril. If they were repaired, their full pre-destruction production of 27 wains of mithril a season would be restored.
