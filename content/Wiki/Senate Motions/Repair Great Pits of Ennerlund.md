To repair the pits of Enderlund.Proposed by [[Sermersuaq]], seconded by [[Mitwold]].
### Overview
* The [[Great Pits of Ennerlund]] in [[Holberg]] were [[Liberated]] by Imperial forces.
* The [[Druj]] collapsed the Great Pits in Winter 378YE, and destroyed the pumping mechansisms. In addition to great loss of life, the Mineworkings were rendered inoperable.
* Passed at 0 Thrones.
### Date
Spring 379YE
### Costs
* [[Materials]]: 250 Thrones
* Time: 9 months
* Upkeep: If the Great Pits are restored, their standard upkeep would apply.
### PrOgress
* 250 Thrones provided by Bridget Eastville of [[The Marches]] after Spring Equinox 379YE.
* The Great Pits were initially predicted to begin producing [[Mithril]] again after Spring Equinox 380YE, with the first resources being delivered at Summer 380YE. Following the extensive haunting of the mines, this prediction has been pushed back a season; the pits will begin producing mithril again after the Summer Solstice 380YE, with the first mithril received in time for the Autumn Equinox.
### Outstanding
* No more money
* 6 months of work
### Campaign Outcome
* At the moment the Great Pits are producing no mithril. If they were repaired, their fUll pre-destruction production of 27 wains of mithril a season would be restored.
