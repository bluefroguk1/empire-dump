With true [[Pride|pride]] the Winterfolk have resolved to relinquish our claim on the [[Territory|territory]] of [[Skarsind]].
We take this courageous step out of [[Loyalty|loyalty]] to [[The Empire|the Empire]], and in particular the citizens of the Imperial Orc nation.
It is our [[Ambition|ambition]] that [[Skarsind]] should become the first home for the Imperial Orc nation, such that they may find [[Prosperity]].
This may be vetoed by the [[Wintermark]] National [[Assembly]] in addition to the normal processes ''Proposed by [[Sermersuaq]], seconded by Skarsind.''

* It motion requires ratification by [[The Throne]], and has no legal basis until then.
* This motion was passed unanimously by [[The Senate|the Senate]].
### Date

### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* If the motion is ratified, the territory of Skarsind would no longer be part of Wintermark.
