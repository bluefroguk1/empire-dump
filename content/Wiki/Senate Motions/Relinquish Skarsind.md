---
With true pride the Winterfolk have resolved to relinquish our claim on the territory of Skarsind.
We take this courageous step out of loyalty to the Empire, and in particular the citizens of the Imperial Orc nation.
It is our ambition that Skarsind should become the first home for the Imperial Orc nation, such that they may find Prosperity.
This may be vetoed by the Wintermark National Assembly in addition to the normal processes ''Proposed by Sermersuaq, seconded by Skarsind.''
### Overview
* This motion would renounce the [[Wintermark]] claim to the territory of [[Skarsind]]
* As Skarsind is still part of the Empire, it would allow for a new motion of [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Assignment|assignment]] to be called.
* This motion has ''significant'' constitutional ramifications.
* It motion requires [[The Throne#Ratification|ratification]] by [[The Throne]], and has no legal basis until then.
* This motion was passed unanimously by the Senate.
### Date
* Spring 379YE
### Campaign Outcome
* If the motion is ratified, the territory of [[Skarsind]] would no longer be part of [[Wintermark]].
* Once relinquished, the territory will be assigned to a new Imperial nation following a standard vote of [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Assignment|assignment]] by the Imperial Senate.
* The [[Imperial Bourse#The Brilliant Shore|Brilliant Shore]] is a national Bourse position, control will remain with Wintermark until the territory is assigned to a new Imperial nation.
* This motion would later lead directly to the creation of the Senate power of [[Create Senate power of relinquishment II|relinquishment]], allowing the Senate to relinquish any [[Territory]] or Bourse seat so that they could be [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Assignment|assigned]] or [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Allocation|allocated]] again.
## Constitution
* The Constitutional Court acknowledge that this motion represents the true will of the Wintermark people due to the unanimous support of the [[Senator|senators]] of that nation and the right of the Wintermark Assembly to veto it.
* This motion may be [[Powers of the Imperial Senate#Abrogration|abrogated]] by the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]] at any time before its ratification
* This motion may be [[Veto|vetoed]] by the Assembly of the Nine, the General Assembly or - as specified - the Wintermark National Assembly; the [[Imperial Synod|Synod]] has until the start of the first senate session at the Summer Solstice to apply this veto.
* As this is a constitutional matter, the motion would not count against the one veto allowed each summit.
* During the Autumn Equinox 379YE, the use of the [[The Throne#Using an Imperial Favour|Imperial Favour]] of [[Empress Britta]] allowed the ratification of this motion in the absence of a Throne. The senate then chose to [[Assign Skarsind]] to the Imperial orcs.
