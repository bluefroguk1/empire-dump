With true [[Pride]] the Winterfolk have resolved to relinquish our claim on the territory of [[Skarsind]].
We take this Courageous step out of [[Loyalty]] to [[The Empire]], and in particular the citizens of the Imperial Orc nation.
It is our [[Ambition]] that Skarsind should become the first home for the Imperial Orc nation, such that they may find [[Prosperity]].
This may be Vetoed by the [[Wintermark]] National [[Assembly]] in addition to the normal processes ''Proposed by [[Sermersuaq]], seconded by Skarsind.''
### Overview
* This motion would renounce the Wintermark claim to the territory of Skarsind
* As Skarsind is still part of the Empire, it would allow for a new motion of assignment to be called.
* This motion has ''significant'' constitutional ramifications.
* It motion requires ratification by [[The Throne]], and has no legal basis until then.
* This motion was passed unanimously by the Senate.
### Date
* Spring 379YE
### Campaign Outcome
* If the motion is ratified, the territory of Skarsind would no longer be part of Wintermark.
* Once relinquished, the territory will be assigned to a new Imperial nation following a standard vote of assignment by the [[Imperial Senate]].
* The [[Brilliant Shore]] is a national Bourse position, control will remain with Wintermark until the territory is assigned to a new Imperial nation.
* This motion would later lead directly to the creation of the Senate power of relinquishment, allowing the Senate to relinquish any Territory or Bourse seat so that they could be assigned or allocated again.
## Constitution
* The Constitutional Court acknowledge that this motion represents the true will of the [[Wintermark People]] due to the unanimous support of the Senators of that nation and the right of the Wintermark Assembly to [[Veto]] it.
* This motion may be abrogated by the Senate at any time before its ratification
* This motion may be vetoed by the Assembly of the Nine, the [[General]] Assembly or - as specified - the Wintermark National Assembly; the Synod has until the start of the first [[Senate session]] at the Summer Solstice to apply this veto.
* As this is a constitutional matter, the motion would not count against the one veto allowed each summit.
* During the Autumn Equinox 379YE, the use of the [[Imperial Favour]] of [[Empress Britta]] allowed the ratification of this motion in the absence of a Throne. The senate then chose to Assign Skarsind to the [[Imperial Orcs]].
