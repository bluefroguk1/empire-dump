__NOTOC__
To create the [[Imperial Title]] of [[Dean of the Thorned Rose]]. A place of learning to be build just outside of Seren, in [[Miaren]]. This will be a place to teach prospective vates. To explain what it means to swear the oath and to help those that wish to learn of [[Magic]] and the realms in how to proceed. This will function as a mana [[Sinecure]]. The Dean will be appointed by the [[Navarr]] Senators, and will have tenure. The Dean will be expected to swear the following oath: “Never to sway from the path of the Vate: this I swear. Take in the willing, share my life’s [[Wisdom]]: this I swear. Train them in all they need to know, prepare them for the Oath: this I swear. Never to accept the Vate Oath of the irresponsible, reckless, or unWorthy: this I swear.''Imperial Wayleave by Silvio di [[Tassato]]''
