* Passed
### Date
* Spring 381YE
### Cost
* Unknown; this commission represents an [[Opportunity]].
### Progress
* 10 wains of weirwood and 20 crowns provided by Gant Archama after the Spring Equinox 381YE.
### Campaign Outcome
* The docks at Caricomare have been completed, creating the Imperial title [[Overseer of the Cavabianca Dock]], a National League title appointed through the Bourse.
* The first shipment of white granite is expected to be available after the Summer Solstice.
The Bourse shall control access to those resources that are essential to the prosperity of any great empire. Appointment to the Bourse shall be established by auction and shall be free of all interference of the Senate, or from the Synod.
### Constitutional Court
The Constitutional Court notes that as the [[Motion wording#Necessary Details|necessary details]] of whether this title is Imperial or national have been omitted, the senator who proposed the motion is entitled to instruct the civil service however they choose. Since the commission concerns the acquisition of bourse materials, the title cannot be amended later by the Senate.
