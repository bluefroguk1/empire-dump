__NOTOC__
[[The Senate]] to create the powers detailed by Jorma Steelhail in his [[Statement of Principle]] within [[The Synod|the Synod]] during [[Winter]] 379 summit.
These powers are the judgements of Castigation, Vindication and Penance. The intent of these powers are to conclude and proclaim the outcomes of [[Inquisition]] that cannot be reasonably included under [[Condemnation]].
The powers of Castigation, Vindication and Penance are escalated from [[Inquisition]] in the same manner as Condemnation and the powers and responsibilities are detailed below:
* Castigation: The target is believed by the [[Assembly]] to be guilty of Unvirtuous deeds and nature and is formally rebuked.
* Penance: The target is believed by the [[Assembly]] to have engaged in both Virtuous and Unvirtuous behaviour. The [[Judgement|judgement]] recommends how the target can correct their Unvirtuous behaviour.
* Vindication: The target is believed by the [[Assembly]] to be innocent of any accused Unvirtuous acts levelled against them and/or be of a Virtuous disposition and is formally lauded as Virtuous.
Proposed by the [[Conscience of the Senate]], Seconded by [[Redoubt]]
### Overview
* This motion was to modify the [[Synod]] power of [[Inquisition]]
* Passed
### Date
* [[Autumn]] 380YE
### Constitution
The Constitutional Court note that there is an ambiguity in the wording of the [[Senate motion]]. The implication is that the author intends that castigation, vindication and penance are raised from an [[Inquisition|inquisition]] - but does not explicitly [[Mandate|mandate]] that. Furthermore, the simplest legal interpretation of the opening line of the motion is that the [[Senate]] wish the Synod to have access to the judgements of castigation, vindication and penance. The intent may be that these powers [[Will|will]] be used only after an inquistion, but that is not the legal protocol for a [[Judgement|judgement]]. Intent [[Will|will]] [[Guide|guide]] the [[Judgement|judgement]] of the Synod, but is never legally binding.
In cases where there are different possible interpretations of a motion, the Constitutional Court restrict their deliberations to those interpretations which are constitutionally valid. It is the decision of the court that it would not be constitutional for the Synod to have access to the judgements of Castigation, Vindication and Penance but not be able to submit them without first submitting an [[Inquisition|inquisition]]. "Voting in the Synod [[Will|will]] be performed by such assemblies as are rightfully able to weigh the virtue of an action or individual, in accord with their [[Nationality|nationality]] and authority." If condemnation does not require an inquisition first, then there is no constitutional basis to prevent an [[Assembly|assembly]] by rightfully able to weigh the virtue of an action or individual, with regard to vindication, castigation, or penance. Therefore the only constitutional interpretation of [[The Law|the law]] is one in which the Synod may submit these new judgements - exactly as if they were a condemnation.
OOC Note: It is not completely clear if the Conscience intended to allow the Synod to submit the new judgements without first submitting an inquisition, but we have ruled that the new judgements must follow exactly the same rules as condemnation in the interests of keeping a simple set of rules that players have the best possible chance to understand.
