__NOTOC__
We ask permission to build the Salt Guard, Menno van Ritsjhofâ€™s planned [[Fortification|fortification]] in Siroc, and for a disbursement of funds for the construction.
''Proposed by [[Madruga]], seconded by [[Feroz]].''
## Overview
* [[Commission]] a unique [[Fortification]] in [[Madruga]] as part of an [[Opportunity]] presented by the famed [[Architect|architect]] Menno van Ritsjhof.
* Passed at 80 Thrones
## Date
* [[Summer]] 382YE
## [[Cost]]
* This [[Commission|commission]] uses non-standard costs.
* 100 wains of [[White granite|white granite]]
* 20 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]]
* 30 Thrones labour costs
* Upkeep: 10 Thrones each season
* A year to complete
## Progress
* 25 wains of [[White granite]], 5 wains of [[Weirwood]], and 10 thrones provided by Adan i DelToro i [[Riqueza]] after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* 30 wains of [[White granite|white granite]], 14 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], and 11 thrones provided by Lieselotte van [[Holberg]] after the [[Autumn]] Equinox 382YE.
* Targeted by ''The Immaculate [[Architect]]'' [[Ritual|ritual]] after the Autumn Equinox 382YE.
* 25 wains of [[White granite|White Granite]], 1 wain of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], and 4 Thrones provided by Imperatrix Lisabetta after the [[Winter]] Solstice 382YE.
* 20 wains of [[White granite|white granite]], and 5 Thrones, [[Will|will]] be provided by the vigilant citizens inspired by the shrine of [[The Sentinel|the Sentinel]] in [[Casinea]]
## [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* When complete, the resulting [[Fortification|fortification]] [[Will|will]] have an effective strength of 3,000 against any conventional land forces invading anywhere in [[Madruga]]. 
* Against any Shore Offensive aimed at capturing Siroc or the Lyceum (essentially any Shore Offensive aimed at the Siroc Plains), the [[Fortification|fortification]] would resist conquest with an effective force of 6,000 (OOC Note: bearing in mind that the benefit of a [[Fortification|fortification]] in a region directly being attacked [[Will|will]] further increase this force, this is a significant advantage).
