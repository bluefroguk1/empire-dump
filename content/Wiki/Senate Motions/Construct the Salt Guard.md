__NOTOC__
We ask permission to build the Salt Guard, Menno van Ritsjhofâ€™s pLanned [[Fortification]] in Siroc, and for a disbursement of funds for the construction.
''Proposed by [[Madruga]], seconded by [[Feroz]].''
## Overview
* Commission a unique Fortification in Madruga as part of an Opportunity presented by the famed [[Architect]] Menno van Ritsjhof.
* Passed at 80 Thrones
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## [[Cost]]
* This commission uses non-standard costs.
* 100 wains of [[White granite]]
* 20 wains of [[Weirwood]]
* 30 Thrones labour costs
* Upkeep: 10 Thrones each season
* A year to complete
## PrOgress
* 25 wains of White granite, 5 wains of Weirwood, and 10 thrones provided by Adan i DelToro i [[Riqueza]] after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* 30 wains of white granite, 14 wains of weirwood, and 11 thrones provided by Lieselotte van [[Holberg]] after the Autumn Equinox 382YE.
* Targeted by ''The Immaculate Architect'' ritual after the Autumn Equinox 382YE.
* 25 wains of White Granite, 1 wain of weirwood, and 4 Thrones provided by Imperatrix Lisabetta after the Winter Solstice 382YE.
* 20 wains of white granite, and 5 Thrones, will be provided by the vigilant citizens inSpired by the shrine of The [[The Sentinel]] in [[Casinea]]
## Campaign Outcome
* When complete, the resulting fortification will have an effective strength of 3,000 against any conventional land forces invading anywhere in Madruga. 
* Against any Shore Offensive aimed at capturing Siroc or the Lyceum (essentially any Shore Offensive aimed at the Siroc Plains), the fortification would resist conquest with an effective force of 6,000 (OOC Note: bearing in mind that the benefit of a fortification in a Region directly being attacked will further increase this force, this is a significant advantage).
