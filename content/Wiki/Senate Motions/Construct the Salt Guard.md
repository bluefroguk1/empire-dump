__NOTOC__
We ask permission to build the Salt Guard, Menno van Ritsjhof’s planned fortification in Siroc, and for a disbursement of funds for the construction.
''Proposed by Madruga, seconded by Feroz.''
## Overview
* Commission a unique [[Fortification]] in [[Madruga]] as part of an [[Opportunity]] presented by the [[The same bed#The Salt Guard|famed architect Menno van Ritsjhof]].
* Passed at 80 Thrones
## Date
* Summer 382YE
## Cost
* This commission uses [[The same bed#The Salt Guard|non-standard costs]].
* 100 wains of white granite
* 20 wains of weirwood
* 30 Thrones labour costs
* Upkeep: 10 Thrones each season
* A year to complete
## Progress
* 25 wains of White granite, 5 wains of Weirwood, and 10 thrones provided by Adan i DelToro i Riqueza after the Summer Solstice 382YE.
* 30 wains of white granite, 14 wains of weirwood, and 11 thrones provided by Lieselotte van Holberg after the Autumn Equinox 382YE.
* Targeted by ''The Immaculate Architect'' ritual after the Autumn Equinox 382YE.
* 25 wains of White Granite, 1 wain of weirwood, and 4 Thrones provided by [[Empress Lisabetta|Imperatrix Lisabetta]] after the Winter Solstice 382YE.
* 20 wains of white granite, and 5 Thrones, will be provided by the [[Sing your name#Securing the borders|vigilant citizens]] inspired by the shrine of the [[Sentinel]] in [[Casinea]]
## Campaign Outcome
* When complete, the resulting fortification will have an effective strength of 3,000 against any conventional land forces invading anywhere in Madruga. 
* Against any [[Navy orders#Shore Offensive|Shore Offensive]] aimed at capturing [[Madruga#Siroc|Siroc]] or [[Madruga#The Lyceum|the Lyceum]] (essentially any Shore Offensive aimed at the [[Madruga#Siroc Plains|Siroc Plains]]), the fortification would resist conquest with an effective force of 6,000 (OOC Note: bearing in mind that the benefit of a fortification in a region directly being attacked will further increase this force, this is a significant advantage).
