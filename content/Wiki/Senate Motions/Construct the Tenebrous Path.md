__NOTOC__
To Commission a sinecure "The Teneberous path" in Hercynia Old Ranging, with the title of "Wisdom of the Tenebrous Path". Self-funded at ten wains of Mithril. To be appointed yearly as a Navarr National position at the Spring Summit by the Military council.
The Vallorn are the greatest spiritual threat to the Empire, and with the Senate's wisdom, we are building the first army specifically to fight it. Isaella's dance will muster at Miaren in the coming summer.
An army is a ship without a rudder, an arrow without a bow without an intent to wield it. This proposed sinecure is to inspire wisdom to the Thorns of Navarr to those who desire to wield a General's banner.
This Senate's duty is not to the titles of this room but to the people we serve.
