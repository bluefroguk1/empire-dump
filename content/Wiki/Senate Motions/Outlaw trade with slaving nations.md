__NOTOC__
Our Constitution guarantees dignity, freedom and [[Prosperity|prosperity]] for all Imperial Citizens.  We also hold true that slavery is a crime against both [[Law|law]] and Virtue.  But our trade with foreign slavers for cheap resources robs us of our dignity and [[Prosperity|prosperity]], while depriving others of their freedom.
On that basis, we should endeavour to use our power as Senators to make sure that our Empire is not compromised by pettiness, cowardice, treachery, half-heartedness, grasping miserliness, carelessness or [[Folly|folly]].  We must not let preoccupation with temporal matters leave us daunted from the true requirements of Virtuous action.
To that end:
We must ban all trade with any foreign nation where slavery is legal.''Raised by [[Miekarova]], Seconded by [[Hercynia]]''
