## Outcome
* Once complete the School of Blood and Brass will allow researchers at the school to begin studying naval warfare, they would present three possible qualities that new Imperial navies might be built with. They would invite the [[Fleet]] owners of [[The Brass Coast]] to vote on which quality they felt was most important - whichever quality won would become the focus on their research which would take a year.
