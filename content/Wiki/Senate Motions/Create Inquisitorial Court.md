** The Virtue Inquisitors would be able to escalate any [[Inquisition]] to a statement of principle without it counting as their single judgement per season.
** The Inquisitors will be appointed by the appropriate cardinal and serve until they die, step down, are revoked, or a new cardinal is appointed who chooses to replace them.
** Virtue Inquisitors would be [[Revocation|revoked]] by the appropriate Virtue assembly or by the General assembly.
** Virtue Inquisitors are responsible for overseeing and coordinating the use of inquisition in service of the Empire.
### Date
* Summer 379YE
### Cost
* None
### Campaign Outcome
* One virtue inquisitor Imperial title was created in each virtue assembly and the assembly of the Way.
### Constitutional Court
* The constitutional court notes that it would also have been appropriate to give the virtue inquisitors the [[Imperial Inquisitor#Inquisitor|inquisitor]] power of the [[Imperial Inquisitor]] - to perform an [[Inquisition]] each season without the need for a vote in the Synod, and in addition to any existing judgements they have raised normally. 
* The constitutional court further notes that it would be appropriate to extend the power of [[Virtue Inquisitor#Inquisitor.27s Judgement|inquisitor's judgement]] to the Imperial Inquisitor as well.
