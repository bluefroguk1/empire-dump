To create the Inquisitorial Court which shall be a body in the Synod to oversee Inqusitions and ensure their accountability and transparency.''Proposed by [[Hercynia]], seconded by [[Bregasland]].''
### Overview
* Eight Imperial Titles of [[Virtue Inquisitor]] would be created, one in each Virtue [[Assembly]].
** The Virtue Inquisitors would be able to escalate any [[Inquisition]] to a [[Statement of Principle]] without it counting as their single [[Judgement]] per season.
** The Inquisitors will be appointed by the appropriate [[Cardinal]] and serve until they die, step down, are revoked, or a new cardinal is appointed who chooses to replace them.
** Virtue Inquisitors would be revoked by the appropriate Virtue assembly or by the [[General]] assembly.
** Virtue Inquisitors are responsible for overseeing and coordinating the use of inquisition in service of [[The Empire]].
### Date
* Summer 379YE
### [[Cost]]
* None
### Campaign Outcome
* One virtue inquisitor [[Imperial Title]] was created in each virtue assembly and the assembly of [[The Way]].
### Constitutional Court
* The constitutional court notes that it would also have been appropriate to give the virtue inquisitors the inquisitor power of the [[Imperial Inquisitor]] - to perform an Inquisition each season without the need for a vote in the Synod, and in addition to any existing judgements they have raised normally. 
* The constitutional court further notes that it would be appropriate to extend the power of inquisitor's judgement to the Imperial Inquisitor as well.
