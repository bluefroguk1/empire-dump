## Campaign Outcome
* Once completed the Iron Roads will serve as a form of [[Great work]] in the territories of Miekarova, [[Karov]], and [[Volodmartz]].
* The Iron Roads would also improve access to the [[Eternal Shafts of Time]], the [[Hunt of Alderei the Fair]], the [[Granites of Veltsgorsk]], and the [[Night Quarry]]. The production of each of these Bourse resources will be improved by 2 wains each season as long as the roads remained open.
* Furthermore, Varushka is a rich nation, in terms of raw [[Materials]]. Perhaps the richest in [[The Empire]]. A significant project here to expand its roads, providing easier contact to isolated vales and their resources, could well lead to further opportunities to invest in the industrial might of the north-east. An influx of wood and metal to the [[Northern trade network]]; more materials flowing to [[Temeschwar]] meaning an opportunity to expand the Assayer's [[Guild]]; easier access to the Mines of [[Karsk]]; and further opportunities to invest in the richer vales might all present themselves if the three grand roadbuilding projects were completed.
