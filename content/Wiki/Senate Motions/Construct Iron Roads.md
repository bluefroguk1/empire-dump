## [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* Once completed the Iron Roads [[Will|will]] serve as a form of [[Great work]] in the territories of [[Miekarova]], [[Karov]], and [[Volodmartz]].
* The Iron Roads would also improve access to the [[Eternal Shafts of Time]], the [[Hunt of Alderei the Fair]], the [[Granites of Veltsgorsk]], and the [[Night Quarry]]. The production of each of these [[Bourse]] resources [[Will|will]] be improved by 2 wains each season as long as the roads remained open.
* Furthermore, [[Varushka]] is a rich nation, in terms of raw [[Materials|materials]]. Perhaps the richest in [[The Empire|the Empire]]. A significant project here to expand its roads, providing easier contact to isolated vales and their resources, could well lead to further [[Opportunities|opportunities]] to invest in the industrial might of the north-east. An influx of wood and metal to the [[Northern trade network|Northern Trade Network]]; more [[Materials|materials]] flowing to [[Temeschwar]] meaning an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to expand the Assayer's [[Guild]]; easier access to the mines of [[Karsk]]; and further opportunities to invest in the richer vales might all present themselves if the three grand roadbuilding projects were completed.
