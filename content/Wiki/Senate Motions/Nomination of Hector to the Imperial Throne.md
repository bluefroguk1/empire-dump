Nomination of Hector of the [[Spire]] of the Celestial Cascade to the position of Emperor.Proposed by the Conscience, seconded by [[Sarvos]]. 
### Voting
* Defeated 4 votes to 18
### Date
* [[Autumn]] 377YE (Event Three 2013). 
### Constitution
The notes record that no [[Proxy|proxy]] votes were allowed for this [[Senate]] vote. This is not legal, a body may [[Challenge|challenge]] a [[Proxy|proxy]] if they believe an individual is acting fraudulently, but they cannot unilaterally declare all [[Proxy|proxy]] votes to be invalid, no matter how import a vote seems. Denying the right of [[Proxy|proxy]] to a [[Senator|senator]] who is unable to be present is tantamount to denying representation to the Imperial citizens that that [[Senator|senator]] - or that [[Senator|senator]]'s [[Proxy|proxy]] - represents.
