Nomination of Hector of the [[Spire]] of the Celestial Cascade to the position of Emperor.Proposed by the Conscience, seconded by [[Sarvos]]. 
### Voting
* Defeated 4 votes to 18
### Date
* Autumn 377YE (Event Three 2013). 
### Constitution
The notes record that no [[Proxy]] votes were allowed for this Senate vote. This is not legal, a body may [[Challenge]] a proxy if they believe an individual is acting fraudulently, but they cannot unilaterally declare all proxy votes to be invalid, no matter how import a vote seems. Denying the right of proxy to a [[Senator]] who is unable to be present is tantamount to denying representation to the Imperial citizens that that senator - or that senator's proxy - represents.
