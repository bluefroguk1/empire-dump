Replace the wording of the [[Barbarian|barbarian]] visitor [[Law|law]] to read: ''Any delegations from [[Barbarian|barbarian]] nations who arrive on the field of [[Anvil|anvil]] under a flag of peace shall have protection under [[The Law|the law]] as if they were imperial citizens for the duration of their visit and for their direct passage out of [[The Empire|the empire]].'' ''Proposed by [[Miaren]], seconded by [[Segura]].''
### Overview
* Amending the existing law to cover passage out of [[The Empire|the Empire]] as well as activity at [[Anvil]].
* The use of the word "delegation" explicitly means that they are sent as representatives, and are not wandering visitors or mobs.
* This changes the law to dictate that the delegation are not protected if they decide to take a ''scenic'' route home.
### Date
* [[Winter]] 378YE
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* This amends the existing law.
