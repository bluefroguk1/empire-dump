Replace the wording of the [[Barbarian]] Visitor law to read: ''Any delegations from barbarian nations who arrive on the field of [[Anvil]] under a flag of peace shall have protection under the law as if they were imperial citizens for the duration of their visit and for their direct passage out of [[The Empire]].'' ''Proposed by [[Miaren]], seconded by [[Segura]].''
### Overview
* AMending the existing law to cover passage out of the Empire as well as activity at Anvil.
* The use of the word "delegation" explicitly means that they are sent as representatives, and are not wandering visitors or mobs.
* This changes the law to dictate that the delegation are not protected if they decide to take a ''scenic'' route home.
### Date
* Winter 378YE
### Campaign Outcome
* This amends the existing law.
