### Constitution
[[The Bourse]] shall control access to those resources that are essential to the [[Prosperity|prosperity]] of any great empire.
The only well-worn path for appointing someone to oversee these docks would be to have the [[Imperial Title]] appointed through the [[Bourse]]. If the title were Imperial, then it would be auctioned annually. If the title were national, it would be appointed by the citizens of the appropriate nation using their traditional methods.
As the motion does not specify whether the position [[Will|will]] be national or Imperial - then the civil service [[Will|will]] look for guidance on this matter from the [[Senator]] who raised the motion.
