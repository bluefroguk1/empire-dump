## Constitution
This motion is controversial, notably for the proVision of votes in a senatorial election and for the method of [[Appointment]]. During [[Scrutiny]] the Constitutional Court came to the decision that the unusual method of appointment was preferable to one in which a position that provided votes in election of the Senator for Sarvos is appointed by Imperial citizens who are not League residents of Sarvos.
After the motion had passed scrutiny, further discussion by the Constitutional Court identified that the [[Sinecure]] itself was unconstitutional because it provides votes in a senatorial election from individuals who are not present at [[Anvil]]. The motion was not struck down by magistrates at the time and the construction had already been approved. No future sinecure using this appointment method, or providing votes in this way, will be approved by the Constitutional Court.
