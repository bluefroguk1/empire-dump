## Constitution
This motion is controversial, notably for the provision of votes in a senatorial election and for the method of [[Appointment|appointment]]. During [[Scrutiny]] the Constitutional Court came to the decision that the unusual method of [[Appointment|appointment]] was preferable to one in which a position that provided votes in election of the senator for Sarvos is appointed by Imperial citizens who are not [[League]] residents of Sarvos.
After the motion had passed [[Scrutiny|scrutiny]], further discussion by the Constitutional Court identified that the [[Sinecure|sinecure]] itself was unconstitutional because it provides votes in a senatorial election from individuals who are not present at [[Anvil]]. The motion was not struck down by [[Magistrates|magistrates]] at the time and the construction had already been approved. No future [[Sinecure|sinecure]] using this [[Appointment|appointment]] method, or providing votes in this way, [[Will|will]] be approved by the Constitutional Court.
