## Outcome

## Constitution
An Imperial [[Ambassador]] can present a treaty for ratification ''"only when the civil service have confirmed that it is a genuinely negotiated treaty with members of that nation"''. During [[Scrutiny]], the Constitutional Court have identified that this is not a legally valid treaty because it has not yet been agreed by the appropriate representatives of that nation - it is a proposal presented for [[The Senate|the Senate]] to express an opinion on.
As a consequence, the motion has no legally binding implications. Any treaty arising from these discussions [[Will|will]] still need to be ratified by the [[Senate]]. While it may be useful for the [[Imperial Senate]] to express a view on a treaty; even if the Axou were able to reply in time to confirm that they agreed to the exact wording of the treaty presented to the Senate there is no way it would be "executed immediately" in [[The Way|the way]] the motion seems to suggest. In theory, an attempt to pre-approve a treaty could be interpreted as an attempt to subvert the agencies of state because it has not been negotiated with authorised representatives of a foreign nation.
In addition, Gerard le Salle, the Auditor of the [[Imperial treasury|Imperial Treasury]], is of the opinion that it is not possible to pass a motion to change [[Tariffs]] at some point in the future - which this treaty would effectively do. A motion can be used to change the tariffs a nation pays, and a second motion would need to be passed in the future to change them again. He also expresses concerns that changing tariffs for a single season is unlikely to have a great effect other than to remove money from the [[Imperial treasury]].
