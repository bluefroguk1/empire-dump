There is only one virtuous response to a surprise attack from a Foreign Nation that has slain 3000 Imperial citizens this past season.I propose an immediate [[Declaration|declaration]] of [[War|war]] against [[The Barrens|the Barrens]] Orcs that are currently laying siege to an Imperial fort.
Proposed by [[Weirwater]], Seconded by [[Astolat]] 
### Overview
* Passed
### Date
* [[Winter]] 379YE
### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* [[The Barrens]] Orcs are no longer foreigners are no longer protected by [[Imperial Law]].
* A delegation from the Orcs of The Barrens would still be protected, as if foreigners, under [[The Law|the law]].
### OOC Note
The attack on the Towers of [[Dawn]]  has reduced the effective military strength of the [[Fortification|fortification]] from 6000 to 3000. This does not correlate to 3000 dead soldiers but rather a fifth of this figure with the rest being material damage done to the structure of the [[Fortification|fortification]]. It has the impact of reducing the effective projection of military strength by the equivalent of 3000 soldiers as described in the winds of [[War|war]].
