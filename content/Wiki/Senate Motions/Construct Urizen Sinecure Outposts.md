__NOTOC__
To construct outposts and Wards upon [[Urizen]] Mana Sinecures to resolve the escalating manavore problem currently affecting production, and preventing spreading to the rest of [[The Empire]].
To be self funded at a [[Cost]] of 2 [[White granite]] for the outposts and an additional 4 crowns per mana [[Sinecure]].
Proposed by [[Morrow]], Seconded by [[Kallavesa]] 
### Overview
* The [[Commission]] of a series of preventative measures to protect mana Sinecure production within Urizen.
* Passed in Principle.
### Date
* Spring 380YE
### Cost
* 10 wains of White Granite
* 20 Crowns in labour costs
* Time: 3 months to construct
### PrOgress
* 10 wains of White Granite and 20 crowns supplied.
### Campaign Outcome
The wards are now in place around, and the worst of the [[Vermin]] have been cleared from the vicinity of the Caves of [[The Claw]], the Tower of the Fall, the Storm Vault, the Glorious Fountain of [[Dawn]] and Dusk, and the Starlight Drift. 
The new construction has been entirely successful in Repelling the crystal-eaters - meaning that no mana is now lost to the creatures. Such creatures are normally a problem (albeit small) so as a consequence of eliminating them, each sinecure now provides an additional bounty of 1 crystal mana per season.
