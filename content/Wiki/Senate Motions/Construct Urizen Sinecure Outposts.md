aliases:
- Construct_Urizen_Sinecure_Outposts
---
__NOTOC__
To construct outposts and wards upon Urizen Mana Sinecures to resolve the escalating manavore problem currently affecting production, and preventing spreading to the rest of the Empire.
To be self funded at a cost of 2 White Granite for the outposts and an additional 4 crowns per mana sinecure.
Proposed by Morrow, Seconded by Kallavesa 
### Overview
* The commission of a series of preventative measures to protect mana [[Sinecure]] production within Urizen.
* Passed in Principle.
### Date
* Spring 380YE
### Cost
* 10 wains of White Granite
* 20 Crowns in labour costs
* Time: 3 months to construct
### Progress
* 10 wains of White Granite and 20 crowns supplied.
### Campaign Outcome
The wards are now in place around, and the worst of the vermin have been cleared from the vicinity of the [[Custodian of the Claw#The Caves of the Claw|Caves of the Claw]], the [[Keeper of the Tower of the Fall#The Tower of the Fall|Tower of the Fall]], the [[Custodian of the Storm Vault#The Storm Vault|Storm Vault]], the [[Keeper of the Glorious Fountain#The Gorious Fountain of Dawn and Dusk|Glorious Fountain of Dawn and Dusk]], and the [[Custodian of the Starlight Drift |Starlight Drift]]. 
The new construction has been entirely successful in repelling the crystal-eaters - meaning that no mana is now lost to the creatures. Such creatures are normally a problem (albeit small) so as a consequence of eliminating them, each sinecure now provides an additional bounty of 1 crystal mana per season.
