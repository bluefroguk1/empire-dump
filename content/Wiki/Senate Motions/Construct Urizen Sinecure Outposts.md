### [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
The wards are now in place around, and the worst of the [[Vermin|vermin]] have been cleared from the vicinity of the Caves of [[The Claw|the Claw]], the Tower of the Fall, the Storm Vault, the Glorious Fountain of [[Dawn]] and Dusk, and the Starlight Drift. 
The new construction has been entirely successful in repelling the crystal-eaters - meaning that no mana is now lost to the creatures. Such creatures are normally a problem (albeit small) so as a consequence of eliminating them, each sinecure now provides an additional bounty of 1 crystal mana per season.
