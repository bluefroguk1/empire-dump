__NOTOC__
To accept the offer of the [[Great Forest Orcs]] to construct a [[Fortification|fortification]] in the Lower Tarn Valley.''Proposed by [[Redoubt]], Seconded by [[Segura]].''
## Overview
* This motion accepts the offer of the Great [[Forest]] Orcs to undertake the creation of a new [[Fortification|fortification]], in the Lower Tarn Valley in [[Therunin]].
* This is the result of an offer by the orcs of the Great [[Forest]].
* Passed in principle
## Date
* [[Autumn]] 381YE
## [[Cost]]
* As the result of an [[Opportunity]], non-standard costs apply.
* 80 wains of [[Weirwood|weirwood]]
* 20 thrones
* Time: One Year
* The [[Fortification|fortification]] does not count against [[The Empire|the Empire]]'s limited number of commissions 
* Upkeep: There is no upkeep while the [[Great Forest Orcs|Great Forest orcs]] command the garrison. If this were to change the standard upkeep [[Cost|cost]] of 10 Thrones would apply.
## Progress
* 10 wains of [[Weirwood]] received from Cybi Farkas after the [[Winter]] Solstice 381YE.
* So far insufficient [[Weirwood|weirwood]] for a season of work has been provided so no progress has been made toward completing the [[Commission|commission]].
* This [[Commission|commission]] lapsed at the end of the Autumn Equinox 382YE.
## [[Campaign outcome|Campaign Outcome]]
* This [[Will|will]] build a new rank one [[Fortification|fortification]] in the Lower Tarn Valley, called ''The Holt of [[The Oak|the Oak]]''.
* Constructed by the orcs of the Great [[Forest]], the [[Fortification|fortification]] uses [[Weirwood|weirwood]] rather than [[White granite|white granite]] and does not count against [[The Senate|the Senate]]'s number of commissions.
* The [[Great Forest Orcs|Great Forest orcs]] provide the garrison, removing the need for [[The Empire|the Empire]] to provide upkeep for the fortification. They [[Will|will]] control the fortification.
* While the treaty with the [[Great Forest Orcs|Great Forest orcs]] remains in effect, the fortification would be identical to any regular Imperial fortification in practical terms. Any Imperial [[Military unit]] could still choose to support it in the same way as any other fortification built by an allied force in [[The Empire|the Empire]], but it would be occupied and defended by the Great [[Forest]] Orcs.
* If the treaty were broken and the [[Great Forest Orcs|Great Forest orcs]] were motivated to try and seize the Lower Tarn Valley then the fortification would take no part in the initial fighting. If this were to happen, and the orcs to consolidate their control of the region, then the fortification could provide full support to an efforts they made to conquer the [[Territory]] or resist Imperial forces.
* As the Holt of [[The Oak|the Oak]] is constructed entirely of [[Weirwood|weirwood]], the [[Opportunity|opportunity]] provided by the [[Consecration|consecration]] of the Silent [[Sentinel]] does not effect it.
## Constitution
* This [[Senate motion|senate motion]] gives approval for the construction and operation of a fortification by the Great [[Forest]] Orcs. This is equivalent to the fortification (but not the region) being ceded to the Orcs - with the campaign effects described as above.
