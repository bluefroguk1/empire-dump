## Description
A Lamia's Whisper is usually a slim, smooth staff of black wood, elegant and refined and often decorated with gold, jade or ivory. In more rural environments, this implement is often called an ''Adder's Tongue'' and unsurprisingly tends to be decorated with images of serpents or occasionally wyrms. 

These implements are popular with magicians who belong to the [[The League lineage and species attitudes|Reckoner guilds]] of the [[The League|League]]. In pre-Imperial times, the [[naga|naga]] families of [[Sarvos]] were known to carry poisonous staffs and this is likely the source of their popular name. In particular, because even non-magician members of the families carried staves it made it hard for their enemies to deduce which naga were magicians - and it dissuaded casual harassment of the naga because ruffians could never be sure if the naga they were abusing could respond with a deadly, venomous sting. While the fashion is not widespread, it is still maintained by some of the modern Guilds of Reckoners.

The legality of the Lamia's Whisper has been contested occasionally, citing the historical legal status of the [[Scorpion's Sting]]. The problem lies in the fact that the Empire does not consider knowledge of the [[venom]] spell itself to be a criminal offence, so it makes little sense that an implement that merely provides that knowledge should be proscribed.

The best examples of these implements are said to be those made by naga [[Crafting skills#Artisan|artisans]], although this rumour is most commonly spread by naga artisans and so is a little suspect.  

CARITA (''raising her staff''): We don't need to equip everyone with one of these little beauties. We just need to make sure there's enough of them to make you wonder whether your luck's run out today.The Fallen Herald, ''Act 2, Scene 2'
