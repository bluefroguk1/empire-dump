## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  The target character must be a [[Rituals#Contributors|contributor]] participating in the performance of the ritual.


### Effects
This enchantment allows the target to call [[Calls#Mass Calls|MASS]] [[Calls#PARALYSE|PARALYSE]] once during the duration. The character must be able to cast spells to make this call - it explicitly will not work if they are wearing armour. 

While under the effect of the enchantment, the target experiences a powerful [[roleplaying effect]]: they feel detached from their emotions, and their passions are muted. They are conscious of their emotions, but not moved by them. This effect is especially pronounced for those with the [[merrow]] [[lineage]], and they may find they have additional difficulty understanding the emotional states of others, perhaps even going so far as to be mildly irritated by emotional displays.

The character who unleashes the power of the ritual is blinded for thirty seconds; they cannot see anything for the duration.

 The power of the ritual can be invoked only ''once'' during this time.

### Additional Targets
The ritual can affect additional characters from the same [[Groups#Covens|coven]]. Each additional character increases the magnitude of the spell by 100. Additional characters must be present throughout, and each must [[Rituals#Contributors|contribute]] to the performance of the ritual.

## Description
This battlefield ritual allows a powerful magical attack to be unleashed against a group of enemies, freezing them in place for a dozen heartbeats allowing them to be easily butchered. As with [[Inescapable Chains of Bitter Glass]], the effectiveness of the magic depends almost entirely on the discipline and decisive action of those accompanying the magician, but the ten seconds that all the targets are completely incapable of action it should be possible to defeat practically any opponent.

The ritualist who unleashes the power of this magnitude is stuck temporarily blind, and may suffer other side effects. For a few moments, they perceive a limitless expanse of knowledge and cosmic awareness. The experience rarely lasts more than a second or so, but it can leave them mentally scarred and unstable, their sanity blasted and their mental stability crumbing. Very rarely, if they survive this experience, they may recall a momentary fragment of useful information but usually they are simply blasted by the powers unleashed.

The ritual is rarely used in the Empire due to the difficulty of finding the best moment to unleash it, where it will provide sufficient tactical advantage to make up for the ruinous cost and the devastation it can wreak on the ritualist who unleashes it.

## Common Elements
It is difficult to speak of common elements due to the comparatively small number of [[Groups#Covens|covens]] who have mastered this ritual. They would include mirrors; bright lights; geometric shapes (especially spheres, cones and pyramids) and mathematical formulae; tomes of lore; carefully scored music with stringed instruments such as harps; careful movement and invocations of raw knowledge and dangerous power. Completion of the ritual is usually signalled by a great cry of triumph or the sounding of many horns.

Other common elements in this ritual might include the [[Ophis|rune of revelation]], the [[Mawrig|rune of destruction]] or the [[Hirmok|rune of dominion]]. Mawrig is used when the ritualists seek to wreak devastation on the battlefield; some magicians believe that it is likely to leave the contributor who releases the effect more damaged than the use of Hirmok, which seeks to constrain and challenge the raw power of this spell.

Needless to say, [[astronomancy|the constellations]] are often evoked during this ritual, especially [[The Great Wyrm]], [[The Door]], [[The Key]] and [[The Lock]].

"Have you ever seen someone die of perfection?  Have you ever experienced the light of a million dancing spheres as it seared your soul with beauty?  Heard the laughter of dragons echoing in your skull like golden thunder, on and on, until insanity seemed like a blessing and death a sweet release?  Have you ever tasted a truth so profound that it felt like a bucket of live coals rattling around inside your head?  Ever felt yourself struck dumb with insights so terrible your tongue simply refuses to utter them?"

The old woman with glared down at the young boy, poking him with one bony finger to punctuate each question.

"Well, apprentice, have you?

"No, mistress", he kept his eyes downcast.

"No.", she said with finality, "Pray that you never do."  

She took the book of rituals from his hands and placed it back in its place upon the high shelf by memory, for her milky eyes saw nothing, "Pray that you never do..."
