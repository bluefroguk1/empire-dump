In praise of the fine qualities of the earth and good honest common sense!  This song - which contains a good few mud-related sayings - was originally written by Kit the Mummer for a ritual to fortify the swamps of Bregasland, and has since become a general Marcher anthem!

Music and lyrics by Kathryn Wheeler.

A recording of this song can be found [http://www.northshield.co.uk/KitsTunes/DowntoEarth.mp3 here] 


The mud’s the Marcher’s own best friend 
Though you may laugh, its true 
Whilst you think mud is “filthy”, well  
We take a different view  

And when the day is o..ver 
We’ll drink a glass or more, 
to Marcher mud - its in our blood, 
Ingrained in every pore  

Chorus: 
We’re down to earth, down and dirty 
Down and dirty, down and dirty 
Down to earth, down and dirty 
Digging for victory  x2

We scorn polite society 
To cultivate its loyalty 
And though you think it unrefined 
We treat it just like royalty  

And when the day is o..ver etc.

Chorus  

We strive to treat the mud with care 
With lots of muck and tilling 
And it repays us thousandfold - 
That’s why its so fulfilling  

And when the day is o..ver etc.
  
Chorus  

The mud’s the Marcher’s own best friend 
So cross us if you dare 
For it shall heed our call to war! 
Intruders best beware……  

And when the day is o..ver etc.

Chorus
