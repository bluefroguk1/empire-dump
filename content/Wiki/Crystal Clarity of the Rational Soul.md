## Rules

### Performing the Ritual
  



### Effects
At the conclusion of the ritual, the target is [[enchantment|enchanted]] with an aura of calm and serenity. They experience a powerful [[roleplaying effect]]; they feel calm, collected and clear-headed. Although pressing matters have not lost their importance, they feel contemplative and focused on intellectual activity rather than physical action. 

This aura replaces, but does not remove, any other roleplaying effect the target is experiencing. When the enchantment ends, any roleplaying effects that the character is experiencing resume, assuming they have not expired. Other effects of rituals or curses still apply; a character under the effect of [[Anathemic Call of Bug and Briar]] for example is still attacked by stinging insects - the ''Crystal Clarity of the Rational Soul'' simply removes the urge to scratch or react to the bugs. Likewise, a character haunted by a malign spirit does not stop being haunted - they simply have the focus and clarity to ignore the feelings of dread or fear the spirit causes.

The effect lasts until it is removed or until the next sunrise, whichever comes first.

## Description
This ritual creates a powerful aura that dampens emotions and clears the mind. It suppresses other auras, even those created by [[Religious skills|priest ceremonies]]. The target becomes clear and collected for the duration, and is neither supported nor hindered by other similar enchantments or auras.

This ritual is viewed with suspicion by some priests. It can dampen the natural ambitions and exuberance of the human soul, and prevent targets from benefiting from auras created by [[Religious skills#Hallow|hallow]], [[Religious skills#Anointing|anointing]] or [[Religious skills#Consecrate|consecration]]. In the eyes of these priests, this ritual is a [[curse]] and those who rely on it are weakening themselves and their fellows. Worse, some more extreme critics claim that the feelings of tranquillity the enchantment creates are nothing less than a magical attempt to channel the corrosive spiritual power of [[Malign_spiritual_presences#Peace|Peace]].

Individuals who are exposed to this effect for long periods of time find it increasingly difficult to bring themselves to take [[Heroic skills#Hero points|heroic action]]; they are detached from some essential element of their soul that allows them to perform incredible feats. They also feel it increasingly difficult to express strong emotion even when not under the effect of the aura; love, hate, anger, joy, happiness and sadness all become muted. These lingering effects fade over time, but some scholars of Day are concerned that over-reliance on this ritual can permanently damage the personality of the target.

The most common use for this effect is to allow someone who has come under dark influences to be able to endure until a more permanent solution may be found.



## Common Elements
this ritual usually involves a period of meditation or symbolic cleansing. bells, chimes and soft music as well as reflective surfaces and crystals are often involved. The rune [[Cavul]] is usually painted or traced over the target.
