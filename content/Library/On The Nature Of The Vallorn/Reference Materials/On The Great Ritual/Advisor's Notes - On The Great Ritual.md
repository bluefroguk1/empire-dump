The creation of The [[The Vallorn]] is called many things; The Great Ritual, The [[Great work]], The Great Mistake, The Accident. In stories it is often referred to as a ritual that 'went wrong', however that is not entirely the case.

I have included parts of Imperial [[Ritual Theory]] above to prove that to be the case. [[Rituals]] do not go wrong; they do what they are supposed to do. This is the first aw of [[Magic]].

However, it is possible for a caster to misinterpret the end result of a ritual which is what I believe happened to the people of Terunael. In their certainty of their magical prowess that they believed they could control the end result of their workings.

They opened themselves up to the raw power of Spring and while they got the resonances they had hoped for in pure destructive power but did not account for the dissonances, it is not a power to be controlled.

Given the magnitude of the working it is unsurprising that an [[Eternal]] or Eternals may have been involved or consulted. It is up to us to deduce which ones and to what respect. Beyond [[Sadogua]]'s advice (and potentially [[Assistance]]) there are others to consider. Given Yaw'nagrah's love of the phenomenon it is possible she Empowered the initial ritual though there is no proof of that as of yet.
