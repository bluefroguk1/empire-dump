The Reveal that [[Sadogua]] played a part in the creation of The [[The Vallorn]] is a fairly recent one post Nicovar and came to light during Winter 380Y after the Iron Scroll Coven of Navaar worked with their member Cybi Farkas to ask the following question to [[Leviathan]] that he had proposed

**"During the reign of [[Empress Teleri]] The Pious why was Sadogua placed under a [[Declaration]] of Enmity that lasted until 132YE"**

For the purposes of record and to hold the [[Eternal]] Leviathan to account if required in the future. The fUll answer will be paraphrased here as it is important to the politic ongoings of Teleri at the time as it is to the [[Vallorn]] as a whole.

**The Account:**

Leviathan opened with that he was not one to gossip about Sadogua for those who are aWare this should be taken with a grain of salt. Leviathan has a long and well recorded dislike of the Eternal Sadogua and as a result the rest of this response could be compromised by the Eternals grievances, however there is a later piece of information that does back up this account is likely correct in the broadest strokes.

He inferred there were several reasons. Sadogua had been interfering with the [[Sevenfold Path]], we know in recent times Sadogua was responsible for the death of [[Cardinal]] Ashur via desiring a true dose of [[Liao]]. This sounds likely. He had been pushing to have more wizards declared Exemplars and Paragons much to the annoyance of those involved And lastly that Sadogua had tried to become a Paragon of [[Prosperity]] himself annoying others for similar reasons.

But the main reason he states was because Teleri had found out he had adVised the Teruneal on how to take down the [[Druj]] and his response angered her.

Leviathans account states that Sadogua approached the Teruneal and highlighted he knew of a way they could resolve the situation. Leviathans account is very clear in one thing Sadogua did not hand the ritual text that created The the Vallorn to them he did however act as a mentor and for all purposes a "bankroller" to help enCourage it's development.

Leviathans states "he supplied mana, he helped them write the Ritual text and finally he helped them make sure it could be cast"

Leviathan confirmed in his answer that the text he was referring to was the text that created the Vallorn. There was no ambiguity to this.

Teleri highlighted to him that had he made them aware this was going to be the case then he might "have avoided the wrath of the Navaar"

Sadoguas response was it did not matter as they weren't Magicians and "I guess they learnt a lot about [[Spring magic]] then didn't they".

She had him placed under Enmity in response and he states it's only due to under the table dealings once Teleri had passed away that Sadogua was allowed back to [[The Empire]].

This account appears to be backed up by Sadoguas actions in Winter 382YE in which he offered 3 rings "forged before there was an Empire" that had Spring [[Magic]] within if the Empire condemned the choice of conclave to put him under Enmity during Teleri's reign.

Any information that Sadogua may have brought to light is not known to the writer of this document and thus I would advise that information be found.

**Conclusion:**

I think it is important to bear in mind this account comes from an Eternal who has a grudge against Sadogua and although Sadogua's later actions and offer would imply there is some tRuth to this account. Eternals should not be writing our history for us.

I would advise if possible an attempt be made to find any court records or diarys belonging to Teleri during this period so that we can see if there are human accounts backing this up, also we do not know how Teleri became aware of this development which is also important.

I also know that later historians will highlight that Sadogua didn't make The the Vallorn, only encouraged Teruneal to do so. I believe the Eternal needs to be held to account. If something could only exist as a result of your "aid" then you are as much responsible for its creation as those who cast the ritual.

Sadogua created the Vallorn and let no political maneuvering attempt to tell the records of history otherwise.
