**Resonance and Dissonance**

[[Ritual]] [[Magic|magic]] is not limitless in scope and there are a number of fundamental laws that are common to all the [[Realms|realms]], and certain limits that it cannot easily overcome. In addition to this, each of the six have strengths and weaknesses, referred to as resonance and dissonance. Where a [[Realm|realm]] is resonant with a theme, [[Rituals|rituals]] that produce that outcome are easier to cast using that [[Realm|realm]] than any other. For example, the [[Spring Realm]] is resonant with healing [[Magic|magic]], so [[Rituals|rituals]] that [[Heal|heal]] the wounded are easier to perform using the [[Spring]] realm than any other realm.

Where a realm is dissonant with a theme, then it is much harder to create a ritual effect that produces that outcome, if it is even possible. For example, the [[Autumn Realm|Autumn realm]] is dissonant with healing magic, it can repair broken items and damaged buildings, but it has almost no ability at all to [[Heal|heal]] the wounded.

**Some of the Resonances of Spring:**
**[[Venom]]**

The Spring Realm resonates strongly with poison and [[Venom|venom]] of all kinds. Poison is the perfect natural weapon: both plants and animals use it, and poisonous creatures are found throughout the realm. No other realm rivals Spring's ability to poison or envenom someone else. [[Curse of Gangrenous Flesh]] is an example of a disease ritual - infesting the victim with a voracious. sickness.

Like [[Day magic]], Spring can be used to help a patient suffering from poison. However, where [[Day]] works by purifying and removing the taint, [[Spring magic]] causes the poison to course through the target's veins while simultaneously giving them the strength to survive it.

**Savagery**

The wild chaos of the Spring Realm lends itself easily to rituals that fill the target with wild passions, especially rituals that make the subject feel ruthless, bloodthirsty, and ferocious. Such rituals are often inextricably linked with the power needed to grant the strength and vitality. Many powerful [[Spring rituals]] to strengthen the target have unavoidable side-effects that cause the subject to feel rage or similar reactions. Spring curses can force the victim to struggle with base urges like anger and greed.

**Chaos**

All [[Spring magic]] is chaotic and difficult to control, as it were trying to escape the caster. Some magicians have even poetically suggested that Spring magic wants to be cast, it just hates to be controlled. Whatever the nature of the Spring Realm, magic that draws on it all too often has unforeseen consequences.

Perhaps as a result, wild natural phenomena resonate strongly with Spring: storms, gales, and floods are part of Spring, as are tremors and quakes. If a [[Magician|magician]] wants to unleash wild uncontrolled destruction over an area, then Spring magic is by far the most powerful choice.

[[Imperial lore]] does not include any rituals that create plagues, due to the inherent impossibility of controlling who is affected, but the [[Druj]] are known to possess magic of this kind.

**[[Ruin]]**

Spring magic finds it easier than other realms to destroy man-made things. Buildings can be torn apart with vines, collapsed with tremors or simply rot away. In part this reflects the power of the realm to cause all things to succumb to the natural process of decay - for instance dead bodies can easily be made to quickly decay using Spring Magic. In part it reflects the wild power of Spring magic, expressed through storms and tremors, as well as the limitless power of nature to consume everything given time.

**Dissonances of Spring:**

**Control**

Fine control is always difficult with Spring magic: it has prevailing tendency to run amok. It is hard to aim a ritual with any accuracy beyond "what's in front of me". A storm [[Will|will]] hit everything in a [[Territory|territory]]. A plague [[Will|will]] quickly spread. A blessing of fertility may cause unlooked for side-effects such as increasing likelihood of being a [[Briar|briar]].

**Deference**

Spring magic creates effects that encourage rebellion, independence and selfishness, as well as those associated with savage ferocity. The more targets at one time the worse it gets - enchanting an [[Imperial army]] with Spring magic is likely to encourage the army to bloodlust and disregard for authority. It is very poor for enchantments that encourage [[Groups|groups]] to cooperate and work together such as congregations, military units and armies.

**Complexity**

Complex concepts and ideas, especially social structures like trade, alliances, and relationships are also beyond Spring. Spring magic is ill-suited to anything that requires subtlety or this kind of complexity.

**Subtlety**

Powerful Spring magic lacks subtlety. It is direct and tends to overwhelm opposition rather than circumvent it. It doesn't gently erode a wall, it tears it down with animated vines. Curses won't make the victim feel on edge or unwell, they send them into fevered convulsions. [[Roleplaying effects]] create energy and passion.

**Construction**

Spring does not work well with objects made by mortal beings, either creating or restoring them. Living things can be healed - Spring magic can lend supernatural haste to the natural process of recovery - but it cannot repair broken objects. It might make a tree-branch into a temporary club or wind trees together to make a [[Sanctuary|sanctuary]], but restoring the unnatural craftsmanship of mortals to something that has been damaged is anathema.

**Conformity and Stagnation**

Spring magic can be wild and chaotic and it has a powerful tendency to cause these results even when they are undesirable. Because of this it is particularly poor for casting rituals that require things to conform, to grow more similar in nature or form. Spring magic hates stagnation and status quo. It is good at changing things but especially weak when trying to preserve things just as they are.

**[[The Law]] of Intent**

Sometimes called the first [[Law|law]] of magic, the Law of Intent stipulates that a [[Formulaic ritual|formulaic ritual]] can achieve only what the ritual was designed to do. Many magicians claim it is called formulaic magic for this very reason. The ability of [[Rivers of Gold]] to enhance the production of a [[Business|business]] by 180 rings is the fundamental intent of the ritual. It is not possible to perform the ritual on a [[Mine|mine]] or a [[Farm|farm]], nor to cast it with more mana crystals to get more money. The ritual can only be performed exactly as it was originally intended when it was formulated.

At first glance, [[Spontaneous magic|spontaneous magic]] appears to offer a more flexible alternative, but the truth is that it is no more flexible than formulaic magic and often less so. Some variations can be part of a [[Formulaic ritual|formulaic ritual]], if the ritual is designed and constructed that way. When a magician creates a ritual projection to create a spontaneous effect, they must specify the intent of the ritual as exactly as possible. This can be much more demanding than an equivalent formulaic ritual - for example an [[Arcane projection|arcane projection]] to divine the properties of a [[Magical Item|magical item]] would be useful only for that magical item.
