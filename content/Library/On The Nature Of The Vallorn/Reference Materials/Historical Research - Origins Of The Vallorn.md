Requested by Neb Firstdance, second [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] and published in Summer 379YE. More recent versions of this document have published by the Civil Service since. Major addendums will be included been beneath the original wording.

Caveat: On the problems of researching [[The Vallorn]] To quote Magistrate Abraham, "the [[Vallorn]] seem to suffer an endemic problem with having every mysterious problem anyone can find assigned to them. This is particularly acute with the [[Navarr]], who seem desperate to label everything that issues forth from the entire Spring [[Realm]] as a Vallorn, but the other nations are
just as guilty. This makes it incredibly hard to carry out any reliable research on The the Vallorn because there is no skepticism, no rigour to any of the claims made on it's behalf. Nobody questions anything. By accepting every conceivable claim made on behalf of The the vallorn, those obsessed with it, have effectively buried the true danger beneath a mountain of fertilizer."

This what means that there is no shortage of theories as to the origin of the vallorn; what there is, is a complete lack of any reliable tool to separate crazy speculation  from speculation at least peripherally in facts. Furthermore,  while it's there are literally acres of evidence of The the vallorn today, it's very nature makes it next to impossible to use that evidence to extrapolate what the vallorn was like when it began - the nature of the vallorn is to change itself and the things it comes into contact with.

Finally, [[Emperor Nicovar]] destroyed almost all unified Imperial speculation on the Vallorn prior to his firey reign. While he did not pursue the Navarr specifically, a number of copies of old books and scrolls precious to the Navarr had been gifted to imperial libraries in the first century after the founding. Their loss was an incalcuable blow to vallorn - and Terunael - scholarship. With these caveats in mind, we have done our best to winnow out the crazed theories and represent only verifiable facts. The Vallorn is a phenomenon.

The Vallorn covers large areas of [[Hercynia]], [[Liathaven]], [[Therunin]], andBroceliande. At one time, it completely covered these territories, and the territory of [[Miaren]]. The Stridings and steadings of the Navarr have, over time, allowed portions of those territories to be reclaimed - and in the case of Miaren, entirely freed from vallorn infestation.

The Vallorn itself is innately connected to the [[Magic]] of the Spring Spring realm. Speculation exists as to whether this means it is an intrusion into the mortal realm from the realm of Spring itself, or merely the result of an extremely powerful expression of mortal magic.

The vallorn spreads to fill all available territory, but like a ritual [[Enchantment]] or [[Curse]] tends not to extend beyond the borders of those territories without the [[Assistance]] of outside forces. Specifically, attempts to spread the vallorn or utilise it as a doomsday weapon, have been reported occasionally in history but in all cases the nascent vallorn has been rooted out before it could gain purchase (see the recent [[Events]] in [[Casinea]], and the apocalyptic cult that
prompted them).

Centuries before [[The Empire]], humans lived in the fertile plains around the Bay of Catazaar Before the vallorn existed there was a human civilisation in the area now occupied by the Empire which is called "Terunael". It is believed that it was a contemporary of a number of other human cultures; the [[Suaq]] and [[Kallavesi]] on the cold plains of the north-west; the Ushka in the Forests and hills of the north-east; the fore-runners of the [[Urizen]] (and perhaps the Axou) in the south-east; and the fore-runners of the [[Feni]] (and perhaps the Suranni, and the [[Faraden]]) in the south-west.

There may have been other Tribes in the fertile plains, but no evidence of their existance has been found - although some scholars speculate that the structures credited to the paragon know as The [[The Sentinel]], or the dolmens of [[Bregasland]], or the Sign of Tamar, may have been built by such a vanished [[Tribe]]. They built cities, organized into loose kingdoms, and formed alliances with one another.

The Terunael were clEarly distributed over a wide area, as the locations modern forests indicate. It is believed that at the time the Terunael were active, of the much of this area would have been fertile plains scattered with normal woodlands. No reference to the cities as being built in "forests" has come to light during the exploration of the limited Terunael Ruins.

While there are ruins that date to Terunael times in many places, there are no signs of large settlements outside of the five vallorn forests. This leads some researchers to speculate that the Terunael had more in common with the modern League than with the Navarr themselves. Without wishing to indulge fantasists, there is some circumstantial evidence to suggest Terunael may have grown out of a confederation of tiny kingdoms rather than beginning as a single
nation. At the time of the disaster that ended it, however, there seems to be evidence it was culturally, legally, and possibly politically, unified.

The cities themselves were certainly large settlements, but not on the scale of [[The League]] cities of today. Exploration in Miaren has shown that the central "cities" were more likely closer to large towns, surrounded by a network of Farms and villages. The largest of these towns is believed to have been Terunael itself, and it's ruins are said to stand at the heart of Broceliande.

There are persistent rumours of additional cities beyond the ones that are part of the Empire today. There are stories of a city north of [[Varushka]], built in lands now dominated by the [[Thule]], Warmed and lit by an artificial sun. The city is Generally referred to as "Emrys". There is some historical evidence for this city - some vales in Varushka have Ushkan records that speak of people coming from the north fleeing a disaster lead by a "brave woman marked by horror and pain, and her son" Some of these refugees settled in Varushka with the woman, others followed her son and joined with "their cousins to the south" the people who would become the Navarr.

Another rumour talks of a city east of Therunin, somewhere in [[The Mallum]], built on the edge of a great marsh and referred to as BÃ©antal Dol.

A third rumour suggests there is a city south of [[Sarvos]], drowned beneath the Bay of Catazaar, which is called "Feion Essa" and appears in fanciful stories. A common of thread in the tale is the idea that the drowned city is inhabited by a race of intelligent fishpeople who consort with dolphins and live life of idyllic splendour. Most of these stories can be traced to a book written a in League sometime in the early days of the Empire and are almost certainly rubbish.

Finally, there are some unconfirmed reports that there is a vallorn in modern-day [[Axos]]. If this is the case, then it is likely that at the heart of this vallorn is another Terunael settlement. The Terunael were engaged in a [[War]] against the orcs.

This is a common, recurring element in stories of the fall of Terunael and the birth of the vallorn. One or more orc tribes were making war against them. The forerunners of the [[Druj]] and the Thule in particular are believed to have been invading the territories claimed by the Terunael in the east and north.

There is little evidence of unified attacks - as today, the orc tribes were separate and fractious. Colwyn of Boarsdell has presented the theory that a third major factor lies in two tribes of orcs who are no longer in existance today. These additional tribes occupied the lands now dominated by [[Dawn]] and [[The Marches]] today. One tribe would have been the ancestors of the orcs finally
exterminated by the Dawnish in [[Semmerholm]] during their first wave of expansion. The other tribe most likely were the ancestors of the orcs driven out of the Marches, who later joined with the [[Jotun]] in the west. He further suggests that the bandit orcs of the Lasambrian hills are likely to be the descendants of the same orcs who attacked Liathaven during the fall of Terunael, before being driven west by the Freeborn exodus.

Either way, the true victors of the fall of Terunael were certainly the orcs. There are plenty of references that the human settlers who would later help form the Empire ([[Highguard]], Dawn, [[Steinr]]/Vard) encoutered land populated by Prosperous, Healthy tribes of orcs who had spread across the lands between the vallorn forests.

Navarr stories record that its cultured cities were run by its magicians. That the Terunael were ruled by magicians is taken for granted; however, it is based on only limited evidence. It is possible that the Navarr see the cities as having been run by magicians because their ancestors were desperate to blame someone for the disaster. This may be why the modern Navarr vates are seen as servants of the people, and expected to commit themselves to helping others
rather than seeking positions of leadership.

There is also little evidence for how these magicians ruled. Were they organised into noble houses? Was there a council like our modern Conclave? Was there a single ruling magician in each city, similar to the Jarmish Magician-Prince? What was the status of people who were not magicians? The idea that Terunael was "run by magicians" is often used as evidence to support
the idea the vallorn was summoned in some fashion by magic - But it is a shaky foundation on which to found an entire theory. In the ingoing war against the orcs, Teruneal increasingly relied on Magic. This makes perfect sense regardless of weather Terunael was ran by it's magicians. Indeed, Whitelock of the Crimson Banner (a Highborn scholar of the vallorn writing in the reign of [[Emperor James]]) theorised that even if Terunael were not ruled by magicians before the orcs began to invade, they could easily have siezed power during the resulting turmoil.

Magic is one of the most powerful tools mortals can wield to effect large-scale change; it can also mean the difference between life and death on a battlefield. Without warning the [[Rituals]] around Terunael unwound catastrophically. This common belief about the appearance of the vallorn is contentious.

Callus Strategos, [[Dean of the Lyceum]] in the time of [[Empress Brannan]], wrote:
"Rituals don't go wrong. They only do what they do - but they might do it in an unexpected way. Especially if you are overly impressed with your own cleverness." 
He expounded the theory that the vallorn was not the result of a magical accident, but a calculcated attempt to achieve something very similar to what eventually resulted.

It is not inconceivable that the Terunael attempted to combine powerful enchantments, and in their desperation combined effects that were in some way incompatible with each other prompting a disastrous, unexpected reaction. Magicians know it is possible to enchant a Region within a territory, a territory itself, and a group of unified territories with an effect such as [[Hallow of the Green World]].

This still does not suggest an "accident" as such. Not least because it is hard to imagine circumstances that would cause the same accident to overtake anywhere between five and nine well-established settlements simultaneously or near simultaneously.

Again, in this it is possible the early Navarr characterised the creation of the vallorn in this way  as an accident to distance their ancestors from criticism. An accident is the fault of fate, or chance, and cannot be easily avoided. Carelessness, desperation, a lack of [[Wisdom]] - these are the failings easily of humans.

The vallorn appeared as part of the disaster that overthrew the cities of ancient Terunael Some scholars speculate that the fall of Terunael was not caused by the vallorn but by some other mysterious force. The fact remains, however, that the vallorn acted on Terunael society in a similar way to which a fUll-stop acts on a sentence. The vallorn destroyed Terunael.

All the stories, all the anecdotal evidence, and indeed all the physical evidence, agree that the disaster happened roughly simultaneously in each Terunael city. At the very least, if the disaster had happened in one or some of the cities and not all, it is likely that the unaffected cities would have offered aid to their allies, or at the very least taken some precautions - and there is little sign of this. From the hearts of those cities, abundant greenery spread The vallorn began in the a sick, infectious wave of life that cracked and crumbled stone, shot great trees up through streets and buildings, and warped, twisted and destroyed most of the inhabitants of those cities, scattering the others to the wind.

The modern perception of this event is of a wave of unstoppable Magic exploding from the hearts of the city and washing over the land like a glowing green tidal wave. Fractured accounts suggest that the reality was somewhat different. While the hearts of the cities were consumed very quickly, the rate of growth appears to have slowed as it expanded rather than accelerated.

The reports talk of "refugees attempting to claim back their lands" and of "warriors (who) fought the spread of the green hell" and perhaps most tellingly "their people attacked by monstrous insects and deadly plants, and though they tried everything to [[Fight]] it, in the end they had no choice but to abandon their homes."

Without doubt the vallorn directly was the cause of massive loss-of-life, but it's initial spread was slow enough that the fore-runners of the Navarr (and perhaps other people now lost to antiquity) were able to flee to the "safety" of the plains.

These initial resistance groups were the first to discover the practical problem of fighting the vallorn. The vallorn is an [[Aura]] that promotes life. Cut back a [[Briar]] bush in a vallorn inested area and it will regrow even as you are trying to cut down it's neighbour. Even fire is ineffective - it seems to find little purchase on living vegetation within the vallorn.

A remedy was discovered however in The Dance of Navarr and [[The Dance of Navarr and Thorn]] - a ritual that siphons off the magical power that sustains the vallorn. Once weakened vegetation and creatures that thrive within it can be defeated. Unfortunately, the it is a slow process. Any hope that the proto-Navarr might have had that they could quickly reclaim their homelands were swiftly dashed. The
Navarr fought desperately to destroy the vallorn

There is no doubt that the Navarr fought the vallorn, before they were even called the Navarr. Not everyone fought however - the story of the "woman from the north" has already been mentioned. There is some evidence that some of the Terunael survivors sought refuge with the Ushka, or among the Feni, and some very scattered mentions that some of them might have ended up in The Mountains with the Urizen (already in their high refuge by the time of the
fall of the cities).

It must also be remembered that the vallorn disaster occurred in the middle of an invasion of human-controlled lands by the orc tribes. It is likely that an unknown number of refugees were killed by the orc armies as they fled their now-inhospitable lands. Others no doubt were taken as slaves or thralls, or died due to the many other dangers that lie in wait in the wilderness.

Those who did survive, and did try to fight were unified by "Navarr and [[Thorn]]" - legendary figures who may or may not have existed. It is unclear how much time passes between the fall of the cities and the sacrifice of these potentially-mythical figures, but the ritual that creates the trods is clearly performed for the first time within at most two or three decades of the disaster.

Contemporary scholars disagree, but there is written evidence from the earliest days of Highborn expansion that the first Dance of Navarr and Thorn was performed in Broceliande, in [[The Ruins of Terunael]] itself (assuming that city exists, or was called Terunael by it's inhabitants). The rest of the [[Trod]] network may have extended from Broceliande, or it may have been expanded from each of the other cities in turn until the five were connected by trods.

There is no evidence that a trod network surrounds any of the other cities - if they are real and not fictional. There is one line in a dusty scroll about Navarr/Highborn up the river, and relations that talks about a "brave band of brands, who went extend the trods never returned" which may be a reference to to include "Beantal Dol" in the Mallum. Given to that an area attempt is part of the Druj heartlands, it is perhaps unsurprising that these Navarr did not return.

The vallorn resembles a malignant, hostile, magical ecosystem There is no clear guiding intelligence behind the vallorn. It does not plan, and it does not appear to be aware of itself or the world. It is not a creature, and the stories that it is some horrible pseudo-[[Eternal]] from the Spring realm appear to be without real foundation in the opinion of this researcher. "The vallorn" may itself be misleading. It is possible that the vallorn is no more a contiguous entitiy than any Forest, marsh, town, or farmland. Creatures live in it; plants live in it; there is obviously a supernatural force at work. Yet it is not clear if that force operates with a purpose or not. It does not seem to actively expand itself, for example. Cases where vallorn creatures or plants have been encountered outside of an actual area of vallorn power always seem to be the result of
tampering by humans or orcs.

Creatures within the vallorn enjoy unnatural vitality, while the air itself appears inimical to humans, but the so-called vallorn-miasma might just as easily be a product of some creature or vegetable that lives in the vallorn rather than a product of the same Magic that provides supernatural health - and creates lEttercaps and vallornspawn.

The miasma itself underlines how much is still unknown by Imperial scholars about the vallorn. For example, the earliest stories that speak of the Terunael fleeing their cities, and the Navarr fighting the vallorn, do not speak of the miasma at all. It seems peculiar that such an abominable phenomenon would be considered inconsequential, even taking into account the apocalyptic nature of the collapse they were experiencing. Yet by the time The Empire is founded, the miasma is unbiquitous. Yet the creatures that live symbiotically within the vallorn's compass seem unaffected by it.

The nature of the vallorn appears to be to transform creatures and plants within it, yet there are no records of Navarr steadings producing abominable beasts, or even having a higher-than-natural incidence of briar births.

There is still a great deal more to learn about the vallorn, it is clear - but such research must be undertaken by modern scholars, rather than sought in the writings of historians and past scholars who have taken too much for granted, and not thoroughly questioned their assumptions.

### Appendix I : Rhonwen and the Withering of Miaren
In the early years of The Empire, with the assistance of their new allies, the Navarr launched a major offensive into the territory surrounding the Terunael city known as Seren. A combination of the (relative) peace wrought by the nations that would become The Empire, followed by their unification, had allows the trods to expand more than at any time since their initial creation. Increased security and the protection of the [[Imperial Law]] allowed the Navarr stridings to travel the trods in greater numbers than ever before in their history.

The time being right, the Navarr engaged on one of their most ambitious projects to date. Specifically, the attempt to reclaim an entire territory from the vallorn. The central city of Seren was chosen because of it's location. Since the trod network was completed, Seren had benefitted the most from the slow leeching of the vallorn's power and was judged to be ripe for liberation.

The vate Rhonwen helped to lay the groundwork fifteen years before the first major offensive. A quiet, introspective woman afflicted with profound deafness from birth, she nonetheless became an adept wielder of ritual Magic - and ArchArchmage of Winter on three occasions. She put forward a theory that the vallorn energies were nothing more than a massive, hitherto unknown,
[[Regio]] of the spring realm. Her theory was extremely radical - she theorized further that the problem was the relationship between this magical energy - this super-regio - and the plants and animals that lived inside it. She pointed to [[The Way]] that Winter regio were known to spontaneously coalesce around battlefields and burial grounds.

While not all Winter regio occupied such locations, there was almost always a connection between the area where the regio occurred and the resonances of the Realm it was connected to. Indeed, eternals had been known to be capable of actively exploiting these connections for centuries, and several were known to offer boons relating to the creation of Regio (most especially [[Prospero]],[[Sadogua]], [[Sorin]], and Yaw' 'nagrah). She believed that the anchoring effect of the vallorn was tied to the fertility and vitality of the creatures in the area, just as
it reinforced and heightened those qualities.

Her plan was relatively simple - she and her coven would invoke the ritual known as [[Wither the Seed]] in Seren, provided an appropriate Regio could be located. In the end, Rhonwen prevailed upon one of the eternals of Winter - believed to be either Sorin or possibly [[Kaela]] - for a boon relating to the temporary creation of a strong winter Regio in the heart of the area now known
as Rhonwen's Fall. Her coven - the Silent Word - and a cadre of thorns managed to secure the area and evoke the regio.

They performed the ritual, but were overwhelmed by lettercaps and a veritable army of vallornspawn husks - some clearly dating back to the fall of Seren itself. The ritual had the usual effect, but it is not clear how much benefit this was to the eventual campaign to reclaim Seren.

Indeed, some historians point out that the ritual effects lasted for a further decade after the territory was reclaimed, and may have been responsible for the slow speed of the Navarr rebuilding there. Wose, it robbed the Navarr of a powerful and influential figure who might have helped them arrange the campaign against Seren earlier had she been around.

Historians do agree that her ritual had an effect - the lettercaps were sluggish and slow to respond to the initial Imperial invasion of the territory, at the very least, allowing the human armies to liberate an additional region before they (and the other vallorn beasts) were fully roused to murderous fury.

Regardless, her history is included here because her theory - that the vallorn was a force of [[Spring magic]], and that it was involved in a symbiotic relationship with the creatures and vegetation that inhabited it - has obvious bearings on the origin and nature of the vallorn.

### Appendix II : Arnaud di Sarvos

I am indebted to my late colleague Arnaud di Sarvos who was murdered while pursuing his own investigation on this topic the last time the Advisor on the Vallorn demanded research on this topic. While Arnaud was unable to complete his research due to having his throat slit by assassins, his notes survived and I believe were given to the Advisor during the Summer Solstice.

Ardnaud was one of our most competent reseachers, and it would be extremely difficult to replicate his work. His time studying at the School of Epistemology in [[Tassato]], and the two decades of loyal service he gave the Empire as an aide to the Imperial Syod before ill-health forced him to adopt the more sedentary life of a researcher, had given him a unique capacity to spot seemingly trivial details and to connect seemingly unconnected facts to reveal a larger picture.

Unfortunately the notes of Calladan of Widow's walk (murdered while travelling to his [[Family]] home); the work of Douglas Wyrdwatcher (murdered while visiting CanterSpire in [[Morrow]] to look into the magical roots of the her Vallorn); and Bridget Windsdottir a sworn pacifist who had chosen to devote either life in service to the Empire, and one of the department's finest minds) were ether incomplete or unreadable due to the amount of blood on them and so could not be incorporated. In the name of completeness, however, we have a transcript of Arnaud's notes here.

### Transcript Quote from Abraham:

### Durstan

There is also reference here and there to a third legendary figure. The stories of Drustan (or Durstan) of the Briars is little known in the Empire, the body of his work was largely lost to Nicovar's [[Folly]].

He was born in Holtford in Miaren in 243YE, studied magic from a young age and was regarded as one of the foremost vates of his age. He was allegedly a driven man, so obsessed with the vallorn that it occupied his every waking moment - to the extent that people admired him more than liked him.

Drustan was instrumental in several major battles against the Vallorn, and was noted especially for his [[Skills]] in turning Spring magic back on the creatures of the Vallorn to destroy them. The tales that credit him with identifying the vallorn susceptibility to poison should be regarded with suspicion, it is unlikely that Drustan achieved this feat alone, and it seems somewhat far-fetched that it was not already widely known by Drustan's time. What cannot be denied is that as a youth Drustan was regarded as the most brilliant warrior-magician of his age - possessed of an unerring instinct for picking the time to fight the vallorn he won battle after battle until his fall from grace.

After the great defeat in [[BrocÃ©liande]] in 268YE, when over 6,000 Navarr lost their lives, Drustan swore off war against the vallorn claiming that the Navarr were pursuing the wrong approach. Thereafter his work became increasingly experimental and people start referring to him as eccentric. He made public speeches criticizing the Navarr leaders accusing them of trying to play the Vallorn at its own game. Not surprisingly such views were not well received and Drustan was soon increasingly isolated. While his genius with magic could not be denied, his political views were simply unacceptable.

An excellent example of this lack of political acumen is taken from the speech given by Drustan at a standing in Liathaven in 272YE, a copy of which still exists! The meeting had been called to discuss the possible risks of the Vallorn in Liathaven spreading, a fear which apparently occupied the Navarr minds as much then as it does today. Drustan became increasingly agitated and when finally allowed he berated everyone present. Reading the transcript, you can virtually hear him shouting - "You shit-eating fools! Spreading the Vallorn? What in Thorn's name do you think the fucking ritual does? It spreads the Vallorn! Go and study the magic - that's EXACTLY what the ritual fucking does." There are no further records of Drustan speaking publicly after this occasion.

If this were all there was to tell of Drustan, that would descended probably be the endof the matter, a brilliant, but misguided briar who into inevitable madness from the hours spent studying Spring magic. But his lifelong friend Arrayne, a Dawnish [[Troubadour]] claims that Drustan made some kind of break-through at the end. He met with Arrayne a final time, in Summer 278YE and told her that he had solved the Vallorn problem. Arrayne claims that Drustan
explained everything to him, but unfortunately Arrayne's understanding of magic was allegedly non-existent and all he could recall later was that Drustan was convinced he had worked out how to fix the vallorn and that it all sounded very convincing.

Few people take this very seriously as Drustan immediately set off - alone - into the vallorn heart of Liavathen - apparently to prove his theory. Given that he never emerged and was never found, it seems likely that it was his mind that had broken new ground and not his theories. Of course it is also technically possible he had solved the problem and he was simply eaten by an [[Ettercap]] before he could prove it. Likely we will never know. His name briefly became a byword for brilliant minds with no friends and then eventually it was just forgotten altogether. Arguably, given how long the Navarr have dedicated themselves to the work of fighting the vallorn, it is actually rather strange that there aren't more figures like Drustan in their history.

### ADDENDUMS
More recent versions of this research remain largely the same with changes serving mostly improve formatting for ease of reading. However, there are updates, most major of which being information on the Terunael cities outside the Empire. I include the revised wording on that section here:

#### Further Cities
There are persistent rumours of additional cities beyond the ones that are part of the Empire today, some of which have been confirmed in recent years. The stories of a city north of Varushka, built in lands now dominated by the Thule, have proved to be true. The city of Emrys stood in what is now south-western SkÃ¼ld, and the claim that the cold tundra around it was warmed and lit by an artificial sun appears to have been based partially on fact. Previously, the only evidence were claims from vales in Varushka about Ushkan records that speak of people coming from the north fleeing a disaster lead by a "brave woman marked by horror and pain, and her son." Some of these refugees settled in Varushka with the woman, others followed her son and joined with "their cousins to the south". the people who would become the Navarr. As the peace with the northern orcs continues, more facts begin to come to life that seem to confirm these ancient accounts.

For centuries there were unconfirmed reports that there is a vallorn in modern-day Axos. A recent expedition, funded by the Advisor on the Vallorn, and arranged with the aid of the [[Ambassador to Axos]] and their counterparts in the eastern nation, confirmed the existence of an immense vallorn in the centre of Axos. According to the first-hand account of Ellian Sweetwater, the civil servant who lead the expedition, the vallorn at Visokuma is the largest known
to exist and surrounds the ruins of the city of Cavan.

Another rumour talks of a city east of Therunin, somewhere in the Mallum, built on the edge of a great marsh and referred to as BÃ©antal Dol. Again, there is a body of evidence that supports the existence of this city, including accounts of first-hand reports from a Druj Ghulai named Greenmask. Located as it is in the Druj homelands, however, the tRuth of any such claims are treated cautiously by Imperial scholars.

Finally, there are stories of a city south of Sarvos, drowned beneath the [[Bay of Catazar]], which is called "Feion Essa" and appears in fanciful stories. A common thread in the tale is the idea that the drowned city is inhabited by a race of intelligent fish-people who consort with dolphins and live a life of idyllic splendour. Most the of these stories can be traced to a book written in League sometime in early days of the Empire and are widely discounted by serious scholars although it is not uncommon for an optimistic treasure hunter to launch an expedition into the bay to find the lost city.
