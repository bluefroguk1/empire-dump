*The Virtuous apply what they have learned; [[Wisdom]] knows all knowledge is*
*incomplete.*

I have referenced many documents, first-hand accounts and [[Ritual|ritual]] findings in
the compilation of this book. I wrote them in what I intended to be a clear and
concise manner to be accessible to as many people as possible. However, my
words do not do justice to the volume of information there is within [[The Empire|the Empire]]
and beyond.

As such in this edition of On the Nature of [[The Vallorn]] I have included as many of these documents as I could. I hope that having this information [[Will|will]] help other scholars and
researchers further understand Terunael, its fall and the [[Vallorn]] itself. Please bear in mind that, as is [[The Way|the way]] with gathering information from several sources, some of these documents may contradict each other in places or contain weighted bias or misinformation (both intentional and not)
