**Winter Solstice, 380YE**
**Lisabetta Giacomi von [[Holberg]] ([[The League]])**
**Accompanied by Livia of Celestial Cascade ([[Urizen]])**

Lisabetta was selected as a Visionary by [[The Throne]].

The visionary gave her permission for these notes to be made public. The [[Testimony]] was presented by the visionary and guide together.

The visionary awoke standing in front of a mirror, being girded by someone who called them "sister". The room they were in was small, with the mirror taking up most of one of the narrower walls. Underneath the mirror was a table, with three candles on it to the visionary's left. [[On the other side]] of the room there was another table, with a bowl of fruit, a small pile of Potions or herbs, and a wand with a greenish end. There was also a set of greaves on it.

The visionary's reflection was of a woman of five and a half feet or less, with red hair, and blue scales on her forehead, wearing some sort of black or dark grey surcoat or [[Gambeson]], with red and gold tabbed edges at the bottom. The sister was wearing a pale dress and a black hat with a jewel in front, with an orange veil at the back of the hat.

The sister said that Bedevere was waiting, and that he would do whatever the visionary asked. She asked the visionary to hold still and strapped on a breastplate and greaves, asking the visionary to hold the front of the breastplate while she strapped on the back.

While she did this, the sister asked, "Have you come to a decision?" The visionary asked if there was anything they had forgotten, and the sister said she would start from the beginning.

They were in [[Miaren]], waiting to attack Seren in order to deal with The [[The Vallorn]]. The armies there along with theirs were from [[The Marches]], [[Highguard]], and the League, the last led by Giovanni, who the sister called "the King of [[Dawn]]" in a somwhat mocking tone. The visionary had to decide whether they were to attack with the other armies, or hang back and go in when the other armies were exhausted.

Once the visionary had been fUlly girded in armour, the sister asked if it was comfortable, and the visionary said it was. The sister described it as looking fit for the [[Earl]] of the house.

There was then a voice from the visionary's right, from behind a curtain, which the visionary assumed was Bedevere as mentioned earlier. They asked what the visionary's orders were for the [[Golden Sun]]:

The visionary said that they would [[Fight]] with [[The Empire]], and were not going to hang back, adding that with the death of the Empress, the Empire was a fragile thing.

Bedevere said that they couldn't transmit those orders to the army, asking how, by the virtue of [[Pride]], could they fight alongside the Marchers? The visionary asked "Is Dawn part of the Empire?" Bedevere paused and quietly answered,

"Yes. Yes." The visionary asked again, saying that Bedevere needed to answer more clearly, and Bedevere said "Yes!".

Then Bedevere asked why would they not, by the virtue of [[Ambition]], go in and take the treasures of Seren for themselves, given that otherwise they would be divided among the armies. Finally, he asked, "What about the highest virtue, the virtue of [[Glory]]? People will sing of this hereafter."

There was some more discussion, and then the visionary said, "These are my orders. You will obey." Bedevere paused, then said, "As my earl commands!".

The vision faded.

Lisabetta's soul was exaMined with the rite of [[Insight]] before and after the vision. Before the vision, her soul was clear of any marks. After the vision, her soul showed a shade of armour around her, that looked like it would fade by the time she next slept.

Livia's soul was also examined with the rite of Insight before and after the vision. Both before and after the vision, her soul had a [[Dedication]] to [[Wisdom]] with the strength of seven priests, and a testimony of "Teacher" with the strength of seven priests.

The coven of the [[Spire]] of Auric Horizon also performed divination Rituals on Lisabetta after the vision to gain information about her past life and corroborate the vision.

The Day divination ritual indicated that the vision happened 300 to 400 years ago, and showed a [[Merrow]] woman seeing Lisabetta as she is now, reflected in a mirror. She builds a delicate machine part with a crystal in it. Earl Nimue de Gavim (possibly "de Gauvain") contemplates it.

The Night divination ritual showed a merrow standing on a hill overlooking a Forest, with [[War]] raging below. If she leads with a shield, she will be stuck behind allowing others to take what is rightfully hers. If she leads with the sword instead, she will betray those who rely on her shield for protection. There is a golden glow in the centre of the forest for the one who first gets there, with a name that sounds like Seren.
