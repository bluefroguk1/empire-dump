Jericho was selected as a visionary by the winner of the Virtuous Auction at the [[Spring]] 380 YE summit.

The visionary gave his permission for these notes to be made public. The [[Testimony|testimony]] was presented by the visionary with some [[Assistance|assistance]] from his [[Guide|guide]].

The visionary came to in a dark, gloomy [[Forest|forest]] with a little light. There was what looked like a wall of creepers, vines and thorns crossing the area of the [[Forest|forest]] they were in, and [[On the other side|on the other side]] of the wall was a man dressed like someone from [[Navarr]]. He gave his name as Prys and addressed the visionary as Envis or Envallis, his wife, who was a [[Thorn]] and also six months pregnant. He also mentioned that they were of the Firstdance [[Striding|striding]], and one of them said that the paths had changed.

They had apparently come into the forest, which was in the heart of [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]], to find a stone obelisk that was there - it looked like four small towers joined at the base, made of a whitish stone, covered in [[Runes|runes]] and designs and what appeared to be blood (the visionary touched it and some of it came away on their hand).

Prys cast [[Detect Magic]] on the stone obelisk, and said that it contained several new [[Rituals|rituals]], including one called Hold The Line, and another with a name that started with Dark or Black. As they examined the obelisk, the visionary heard noises around them in the forest. The visionary said that as a [[Thorn]], they would defend against whatever was out in the forest, and [[Fight|fight]] so that Prys could fall back and bring news of the stone to their people. Prys asked, "What about the baby?", and the visionary said that the baby would come again, they would come again and see each other again.

The vision ended shortly after this conversation, but before it did, the visionary heard a woman's voice saying, "I wanted to give you these before you go, because I'm not going to see you again."

Jericho and Samuel had their souls examined by the rite of [[Insight]] before and after the vision.

Before the vision, Jericho's soul had a [[Testimony|testimony]] of "Exemplary Discipline" with the strength of a single priest behind it. After the vision, as well as the testimony. his soul appeared to be injured. It appeared to be twisted around itself, causing him to be confused about the passage of time and believe that it was up to a year later than it was, and there was also a corrosive miasma across it that made him suspicious about discussing the vision or having the rite of [[Insight]] performed on him.

Two exorcisms with the strength of seven priests behind them were needed to treat these two wounds; the corrosive miasma was cleared first (with a weapon to hand in case he attempted to attack as Allegra Shatterspire had done when affected by a similar spiritual injury), and then the second [[Exorcism|exorcism]] shocked his soul back into place and restored his sense of the passage of time.

Samuel's soul before the vision had a [[Dedication|dedication]] to [[Loyalty]] with the strength of a single priest. After the vision, as well as his [[Dedication|dedication]], his soul was thin and tense, causing him a sense of loss and a desire to be back in the Labyrinth as if he had left part of himself in there. An [[Exorcism|exorcism]] with the strength of seven priests shocked and settled his soul back into place.

Jericho also recognised the woman's voice right at the end of his vision as that of Merryn Ruis Farkas, the late [[General|general]] of the [[Navarr]] army of the [[Quiet Step]], and the words as the last thing she said to him before she died.

The [[Coven|coven]] of the [[Spire]] of Auric Horizon also performed divination [[Rituals|rituals]] on Jericho after the vision to gain information about his past life and corroborate what the vision indicated.

The [[Day]] divination [[Ritual|ritual]] indicated that his past life was a Navarr woman, Enthis Firstdance, who was a Thorn and was six months pregnant at the time, and that the vision took place around 350 years ago. She also had scratches all over her legs and arms, as if she'd been in a [[Fight|fight]] with a hedge.

The [[Night]] divination ritual gave impressions of a stone, an argument between Enthis and another about who'd protect the stone and who would fight off the enemies, and growls and beasts surrounding the two of them. It also indicated that the vision took place during a great period of change for Merryn.

For more information about these rituals, please ask Auric Horizon.

The appearance of Merryn, someone of significance to Jericho's current life rather than his past self - both in the vision and in the divinatory rituals performed afterwards - is not something that has been observed in any other visions since Winter 376 YE, and so more information [[Will|will]] be needed to determine what this might mean.
