**Published Research:**

*During Autumn 382YE, the Advisor on the Vallorn Sian Eternal commissioned research into the [[Abraxus Stones|Abraxus stones]] with a focus on the item's origins and uses of significant stones. The researcher - Luca Friedlin von Holberg - was unable to establish anything new about the origins of the stones apart from to confirm that they were most likely first used by the Terunael. Their primary use was apparently as a gift to foreign delegates. Whilst they were being hosted in one of the cities of the Terun, the amulet's properties served as a symbolic demonstration of the city's intent to protect their guests.*

*Luca was able to discover information about several historical examples of the Abraxus Stone.*

**Gambit of the Wulfhunter**

The Gambit of the Wulfhunter belonged to the warden, Mischa Koschinov Sennariv. In 112YE, according to the stories, Mischa spent a significant period hunting a certain powerful elder plaguewulf that had been attacking vales across Dupadealuri and Srodkoja. The stories claim that in addition to the plaguewulf itself possessing pestilential breath, the husks it created spread that same pestilence in some fashion leading to veritable plague of shambling horrors in southern Miekarova. The warden hounded the creature relentlessly until it had led them back to its hidden lair. Upon arriving at the creature's den Mischa spent several hours killing each husk that came at them, ensuring that when the time came the plaguewulf would have no reinforcements to call upon.

This done Mischa then invited their quarry out into the open. Trapped with nowhere else to go, the beast emerged. The tale ends with the plaguewulf breathing out its pestilent breath on the warden who, with a smirk, drank a simple healing potion - of which the warden had several at their belt - and charged the monster.

Mischa was victorious, and ascribed their success to the possession of a powerful treasure recovered from a barrow somewhere in northern Krevsaty.

The stone was apparently passed down from warden to warden, but its current whereabouts are unknown.


**Halssnoer des Omstrengelend Vergif**

This stone apparently originates in the Sarcophan Delves. Called the Halssnoer des Omstrengelend Vergif, it apparently has much the same design as one would expect from an Imperial Abraxus Stone. It takes the form of a bracelet of a silver metal which has been studded throughout with pale opals and engraved with the owner's family name. According to the researcher, the amulet may have used different components to those involved in making an Imperial Abraxus Stone. The Sarcophan merchant who was attempting to sell the item was allegedly very closed-lipped about the exact provenance of the item; it is not clear if its existence is an example of two separate nations inventing the same magic amulet or if the artisans of the Delves derived the schema for their own stones from the Empire in some fashion.

**The Vate's Shelter**

The Vate's Shelter was worn by the Navarri vate Roswen Doublestep during a purge of the vallorn that took place in Liathaven in the reign of Empress Brannan.

It is said to be a fine silver band that shone brightly under moonlight, allowing Roswen to be seen easily by her allies during her many night time skirmishes. The stone was apparently handed down from vate to vate since the first days after the destruction of Terunael - although it is not clear if the amulet was an actual artefact or simply a treasured relic that was repeatedly reforged.

Being the leader of a potent coven, Roswen would often volunteer to bear the enchantment of Fetid Breath of Teeming Plague despite its unfortunate potential side effects. During engagements with vallornspawn, Roswen would apparently rush into the miasma with a dozen doses of the mageblood philtre.

Through her use of the talisman she was able to get deep into the miasma, behind a large portion of vallornspawn husks, before unleashing the torrent of Spring magic. Roswen and her coven were unfortunately lost during the Summer 225 YE, and her body was never recovered. At least, as the bearer of an Abraxus Stone, it is unlikely Roswen will have been transformed into a vallornspawn husk - although the same sadly cannot be said for her coven.

**The Swan's Chalice**

The Swan's Chalice belonged to an Urizen Sentinel, Niketlas of the Spire of the Green Shallows, who served briefly in the Citadel Guard during the reign of Emperor Hugh. Nikettas fought against the Druj for almost his entire adult life. The Swan's Chalice was apparently a gift from the eternal Ylenrith, allegedly earned at least in part by Nikettas' involvement in the rescue of the Archmage of Day, Gemma Steward. Nikettas fell in battle in Holberg in 365YE and the talisman was never recovered. According to reasonably reliable reports, the amulet was "renewed" in some fashion each Spring by a herald of Ylenrith who sought out Nikettas at Anvil. It is not clear if the herald is still renewing the talisman, wherever it may have ended up.

**Abraxus, the mad "prophet"**

The research explored a potential connection between the magical jewellery and the "prophet" Abraxus Whitespire, but came to the conclusion that the controversial merrow almost certainly took the name Abraxus from the talisman - valuable as it would prove to be to those experimenting with potentially poisonous combinations of herbs and philtres - rather than having any profound connection to the Terunael artisans with whom the stone originated. Luca theorises that the records of a Xavier Whitespire who submitted multiple statements of principle which are in keeping with the future teachings of Abraxus may actually prove to be the original Abraxus. There are no records of judgements from Xavier later than 45YE, and the first known publication of Abraxus was the infamous On the Teleology of Pure Liao in 47YE.

**Excerpts from Luca von Holberg's initial letter detailing his research:**

"First let me say thank you for the opportunity to study one of, in my opinion, the most interesting items that artisans are able to produce. The common use of Cavul and its obvious history with the peoples of Navarr and Highguard paint a fascinating picture of pre-Imperial life.

Origin of the Abraxus Stones

I was unable to gather much more on the origins of the Abraxus Stone, aside from what is relatively common knowledge. The records of ritual responses I was able to gain access to, from the reign of Empress Deanne, date the creation back to the period of Terunael - at least in the area of the Bay of Catazar.

Their primary use seems to have been as a gift to foreign delegates, whilst they were being hosted in one of the cities of Terun, as a demonstration of the city's intent to protect, the amulet being an active defence against poison.

Obviously, with the fall of Terunael, these objects once associated with visiting dignitaries became a vital tool in the fight against the vallorn."

"Ylenrith and Cavul.

The theoretical link between the Abraxus Stone, the eternal Ylenrith and the rune Cavul is an interesting one. The runbe is often used as a mark on the talisman seeing most use, as you would expect, in Wintermark.

Cavul being so closely linked to the Swan it, of course, makes perfect sense for people to link the three together. T have in the past observed magicians, who practice the goetic tradition, calling on Ylenrith's link to the Stone to purify venom within the target."

Further Research

I expect that you will have some thoughts on what direction to take future research. I believe that the more traditional scholarly approach would not turn up more than what I have already managed to uncover. I have some ideas on potential future avenues of research.

- ﻿﻿The material components used in the creation of the Sarcophan variant. I would suggest the Ambassador to the Sarcophan Delves could try to negotiate for that information.
- ﻿﻿Regarding the Swan's Chalice. I would suggest a discussion with Ylenrith could open up some possibilities, but it should be noted that the magic on the talisman was not permanent in nature.
- ﻿﻿The Vate's Shelter was lost where it fell in Liath's Heart, Liathaven.  A statement of principle in the Navarr national assembly, passing with greater majority, could result in someone coming forward with more information.

I hope what I have been able to uncover is of some use to you, Advisor on the Vallorn.I honestly think that, due to the nature in trying to protect ourselves, this might have been one of the first talismans to be 'developed', or at least seen widespread use"

On Luca Fredlin von Holberg's advice the following Statement was passed through the Navarr national assembly at the Autumn Equinox summit of

383 YE:

**Judgement 56**

*After a historical research request we the Navarr National Assembly as a matter of national Pride ask for citizens who have information regarding the Abraxus Stone known as "The Vate's Shelter". This was worn by a vate known as Roswen Doublestep and was lost during the reign of Brannan.*

Raised by Ranulf Farkas and upheld with a Greater Majority (180 - 0)
