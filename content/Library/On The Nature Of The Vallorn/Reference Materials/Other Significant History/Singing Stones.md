*Letter received by Sian [[Eternal]] as the initial research on 'Charter Stones'* 

Sian of the Eternal [[Family]]

I'm sorry to say that I've not been able to find anything of great use to you on this subject. I've included what I can - and a few speculations as well. I hope this is sufficient.

Looking through the remains of the archives of the destruction of The [[The Vallorn]] in [[Miaren]] there are very few actual records remaining. Most of the information on what was found has been either lost or destroyed either by time or the fires of Nicovar.

However, I am certain that there is no mention of Charter Stones - in fact, I'm not sure that such a thing exists or is a thing I can find no mention to Charter Stones in any Terunael or Navarri record. Although I guess it could be a colloquial word for something else.

So not to waste your time, I have looked at details for other stones around that period of time.

Something seems to be watching me through the window. The Civil Service has provided guards to protect me from the [[Whisper Gallery]]... but they hamper my work. I shall try to do as much as I can.

**The [[Singing Stones]]**

There are records that there were one or two odd stones found. These were about 4-5 foot tall and had patterns carved through them, not as curved as the patterns of the [[Navarr]] but more angular like many of the Terunael artefacts.

They seem to sing softly in a lyrical way if you listen closely which is quite disconcerting but it means they have been commented on.

The stones have four angled columns joined at the bottom and I would summarise that a bowl would be placed on the top of the stones for blood to be collected and then run down. Probably a bowl of bronze with holes to allow the blood to flow.

What happened to these stones since, I don't know. One was sold at a Bourse auction, but it seemed to have no properties that would be of use, the records say that it allowed two [[Rituals]] long lost to [[Imperial lore]]. It was bought by the Keeper of the [[Thimble]] at the time, but after the destruction of his [[Striding]] in [[Liathaven]] no mention since has been had.

Sometimes you are so angry, you can't be upset. Escon, my ginger tom has been found dead. I named him after the Egregore himself. When I say found dead, something has nailed him to a tree and cut out his tongue. I hope that this research is [[Worth]] it, I don't get paid enough for this. I know that the guards will help keep me safe, but I can't help but be scared.

**The Dolmen**

The other stone of note found at this time was a Dolmen. It seems curious to have a Dolmen in the heart of the Forest, since most of the Dolmens we have found have been in [[The Marches]], seemingly linked heavily to their Hearth Magics.

I am honestly unsure what happened to it. It seemed pretty out of place in Ruins of the college and military academies. I think records have proposals to knock it down and build the steadings. There are records about having it moved to the Marches, but the results are inconclusive.

It seems unlikely that this was related to the Terunael, it was very different stylistically and didn't have any of the carvings. There are records about it having latent magical properties, but cross referencing, it seems many of the older Dolmens around [[The Empire]] have these properties but the use of the [[Detect Magic]] spell on them doesn't seem to reveal a lot.

**Black Stones**

Possibly related are the stories of "black stones" in [[Varushka]]. There are a number of these scattered across Varushka. They tend to be associated with the various dark powers of the forest. To be honest with you, I find the very few stories of these things deeply unsettling and would rather not look any closer.

They tend to involve [[Anointing]] things with blood and serving as markers for grim oaths. Deeply unsettling, and trailing the dangerous edges of the worst parts of dark [[Blood magic]].

I hope that this is of some use to you and that you are able to make some sense of it. If I can, I'll see if I can uncover anything else and if it is in any way coherent I'll either forWard it to you or Right, a Winter coven has cast "[[There Is No Welcome Here]]" around my house. I am not leaving [[Necropolis]] though. I will make sure that an Autumn [[Magister]] casts Winged Messenger so you can receive this and I'm not leaving my house

Samael

**Further Information on Singing Stones**

Of particular interest to many blood magicians are the so-called Singing Stones of ancient Terunael. Extremely rare, these relics are especially sought after by Navarr magicians for obvious reasons. Only a handful have been uncovered, and the process of creating the is little understood. Each seems to be unique; no two are precisely the same. There are some similarities between those that have been uncovered so far. Each stone takes the form of four angle columns joined at the base. They tend to be between four and five feet tall, made of stone, and carved on all sides with angular patterns somewhat reminiscent of the labyrinth marks common on the skin of many [[Cambion]].

These angular designs are common to many artifacts of Terunael - and somewhat at odds with the curved, sweeping patterns associated with the Navarr. The arrangement of columns allows a carefUlly constructed bowl to be placed atop the singing stone in such a way that the contents will slowly run down the carved designs along each column. The obvious intent is that a bowl of blood with four precisely places holes would bathe then entire stone over the course of a ritual performance.

What sets the singing stones apart from other Terunael structures, however, in that they appear to sing. Each stone encountered so far has its own, barely audible, distinct song. The [[Music]] becomes a little clearer when one is physically touching the object, or when it is bathed in blood as part of a blood [[Magic]] ritual. Each song is difficult to describe, but often leaves listeners reporting sensations of disorientation or unease.

The stones encountered by Imperial archaeologists to date have shared a similar property; they allow multiple covens from the same nation to cooperate on the performance of a specific ritual in a manner similar to a [[Web of Celestial Attunement]], or the ArchArchmage's Belt of Stars. Unfortunately for modern magicians, most of the stones uncovered so far have been intended for rituals unknown to Imperial lore. Although their effects can be surmised, the stones appear precisely made that they require exact formulaic rituals to be of any use.

A larger variant of the singing stones has been encountered by explorers in Terunael ruins are immobile. Unlike their shorter counterparts, attempts to relocate them invariably end up destroying their magic. Most of those encountered were already inert, damaged beyond repair by the passage of time and the [[Vallorn]]. Ifan Redwater, who made a study of one of these obelisks uncovered in the ruins of Seren theorised that the larger stones are intended to work in some fashion with the local flows of mana, not entirely dissimilar to the standing stones that dot the Marches. The obelisk in the ruins of Seren had the property of allowing multiple covens to co-operate on a ritual of [[Autumn magic]] intended to ensure a good harvest for the Farmers of the territory, with a ritual similar to [[Gathering the Harvest]]. Whatever the precise details of the ritual, it proved impossible to use the stone in conjunction with Gathering the Harvest. According to further research, another three obelisks of similar size once stood in the same location, but long years and the destructive nature of the vallor had Shattered them. Ifan Redwater tentatively speculates that they were intended for use with three other rituals similar in nature to [[Blessing of New Spring]], [[Strong Ox, Golden Sun]], and [[Fallow Fields and Dried Meat]].
