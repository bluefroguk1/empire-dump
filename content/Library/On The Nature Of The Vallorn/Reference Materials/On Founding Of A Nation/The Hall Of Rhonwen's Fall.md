A first-hand account of a vision received of the founding of the nation of Navarr by Bledri Eternal. For more information on Rhonwen's Fall see page 173

We had gathered at Rhonwen's Fall to witness the opening of the locked doors behind the fall. On entering the hall I saw that the walls were covered in spiralling carvings that reminded me of the the patterns of the Trods. I was intrigued by this and the once in a life time opportunity to cast magic in this unknown hall.

Casting the Ritual Clear Lens of the Eternal River I cast my sight into the magic of the Day realm and the following is what I was able to witness in the Hall.

The carvings had been there for an extremely long time. I did not witness their carvings but I could see others studying them and using them to inspire magics.

I saw those that I believe were refugees from Terunael and they treated these carvings as ancient. I then saw visions of an even older time. Those I believe were from Terunael using the patterns to inform them of possible magics they could use to connect their cities. These carvings were in place I believe before Terunael came to their full power and they based the joining of their cities on these carvings.

Following the carvings and visions around the Hall I made my way slowly to the raised part of the Hall. It was here the visions changed. I saw a gathering of the refugees and two faces that I recognised from the Skein I received from Thorn's legacy. Here stood Navarr and Thorn the founders of our nation. They were talking to a woman who they called Star. She had taken the refugees from Serenael to this place of Sanctuary. Talking with Navarr and Thorn she interpreted the carvings and they came up with the plan to form the network of Trods to take the power from the Vallorn.

I was then given the knowledge of one last thing in this place of significance.

Thorn stood before Navarr and swore an Oath to her, an Oath I recognised as all Navarr would as the Binding of Thorns. This was where the first Oath of our Nation was sworn, by Thorn to Navarr to fight and defeat the Vallorn. This Hall carved with ancient carvings was the place where we founded our Nation.

I could feel the power of these words and what it meant. The force was so strong it broke my magic and my sight through my crystal was cast back to the Hall as it was.

I was shocked by witnessing this sight. Something that I was sure no-one else had seen in my generation. This Hall was a sanctuary for our people. The place we were founded. The place we first swore our Oaths and started on the path we still walk.
