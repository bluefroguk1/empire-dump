In many of the stories surrounding [[Navarr]] she voiced her concerns against The Great Ritual and rallied against it. It begged the question

"Why weren't her Warnings headed by the people of Terunael?"

In Autumn 381 YE I asked [[Leviathan]] this question, to find out why or to find out if her being against the ritual was simply a thing of stories. The answer was simple. "Because she was property".

The founder of the nation of Navarr was once a slave so it is little wonder that she didn't strive to rebuild Terunael but to create an Empire to surpass it.
