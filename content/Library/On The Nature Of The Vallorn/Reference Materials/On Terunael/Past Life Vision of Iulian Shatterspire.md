**as documented in Echoes of the Labyrinth**

**[[Winter]] Solstice, 378 YE**

**Iulian of the [[Spire]] of Shattered Art Reforged, also known as Shatterspire ([[Urizen]])**
**Accompanied by Allegra of Shatterspire**

Iulian was selected as a visionary by the Council of Gatekeepers.

The visionary gave his permission for these notes to be made public. The [[Testimony|testimony]] was presented by the visionary and [[Guide|guide]] separately, although there were some confounding factors in the reliability of the initial [[Testimony|testimony]], as described after the vision account.

The visionary came to in a room with a small indoor garden in one comer, a bed with white sheets and a cot at one end in another corner, and a table next to the visionary in a third corner. The table had lightstones and two sheets of paper on it, which were a letter, apparently from Merenael, a councillor of the city of Emrys, to the councillor of another city (the second councillo's name may have been Amrillin).

The letter spoke of visions that Merenael had had, with apologies that the visions were from the [[Night]] [[Realm|realm]] - they had taken place in the Dreamscape - and thus metaphorical, but nevertheless gave a clear pattern of [[Events|events]]. The letter warned of terrible doom that would befall the City of the Red Gold Sun - Emrys - if the [[Great work|Great Work]] they were working on was completed, and that the same doom would happen to the other cities.

A man burst into the room. He was [[Briar|briar]]-lineaged, and greeted the visionary by name, calling them "Merri" and "my love". There were sounds from outside of the city collapsing - fire, falling masonry, and the screams of people and animals. The man said that they had two doses of an elixir, and that he and Merenael could go into the Dreamscape (the visionary asked if he meant physically, and he said yes) and they could escape together, leaving their child. The visionary said they refused to leave the child, and that the man should take the elixir and give the other dose to the child so that the two of them could escape. The man said he couldn't face leaving the visionary to the doom that was befalling Emrys, and refused to do what they asked. The two of them argued briefly, and then the visionary said, "If you [[Will|will]] not take it, then I [[Will|will]]."

The man looked at the visionary in disbelief, and the visionary clasped his hand and said to him, "Strength," then fed the elixir first to the child in the cradle and then to themself. When the visionary took the elixir, the vision ended.

When Iulian emerged from the vision, he had a taste in his mouth like that of dried tea or ashes. Later at the summit, Iulian underwent a [[Ritual|ritual]] based on Shift the Dreamscape's Sands, in which he learned more details of the fall of Emrys, and the name of the man in the vision, which was Fallahd.

Iulian's soul was examined with the rite of [[Insight]] before and after the vision. Before the vision, his soul bore a [[Dedication|dedication]] to [[Vigilance]], an [[Anointing|anointing]] of the Demands of [[Vigilance]], and a [[Testimony|testimony]] of "Wisely Cautious", each with the strength of a single priest. (The blatant ungrammaticality of the [[Testimony|testimony]] has interesting spiritual ramifications, but those [[Will|will]] be discussed in a separate
work.)

After the vision, as well as the [[Dedication|dedication]], [[Anointing|anointing]] and [[Testimony|testimony]], Iulian's soul looked like it had had a piece taken out of it, leaving the rest of it thin and apparently undernourished. An [[Anointing|anointing]] with the strength of seven priests would have served to nourish the soul and restore it to its former effect, but an [[Exorcism|exorcism]] with the strength of three priests behind it was enough to clear away the remaining effect to let the soul recover on its own.

Allegra's soul was also examined with the rite of [[Insight]] before and after the vision. Before the vision, her soul bore a [[Dedication|dedication]] to [[Pride]] with the strength of a single priest. After the vision, as well as this [[Dedication|dedication]], her soul was also covered with a gnawing shadow, whose effect was to compel her to avoid having [[Insight]] cast on her and avoid talking about what she had seen in the vision by any means, and at least initially to stop Iulian from doing the same. When he started speaking about the vision out loud after they returned from the Gateway, she apparently attacked him, and would have succeeded in killing him had it not been for the intervention of Adam of [[The Synod|the Synod]] Civil Service. This effect also made it quite difficult to get a true account of the vision from her, and it was several hours before she could be persuaded to be Insighted and then have the shadow exorcised from her (as usual, it took the strength of seven priests).

In this case, a possible cause of the wound to Allegra's soul may be the following [[Events|events]] during the vision. When Fallahd entered the room, another figure also entered behind him. He did not act as if he could see the figure, but it whispered to him to "give in to your despair" and "leave the child" during the  conversation shortly before Fallahd suggested that the two of them take the elixir and leave their child in Emrys. At this point, Allegra was rereading the letter from Merenael, and the figure then turned to look at Allegra and spoke to her, telling her "leave this place - this place is [[Mine|mine]], these souls are [[Mine|mine]], their despair is [[Mine|mine]]" and threatening to gut her like a fish. It divided its attention between Fallahd and Allegra, and then tried a second time to gain Allegra's attention. When she asked "What are you?", it said it was the Eater of Hope. It appeared to have a [[Rune|rune]] on its right cheek - either [[Aesh]] or [[Rhyv]].

A very similar figure appeared later at the summit during a casting of [[Whispers through the Black Gate|Whispers Through the Black Gate]] to call back Ynez di [[Caricomare]]'s spirit; it appeared after Ynez did. It had [[Runes|runes]] on its face - [[Aesh]] on the forehead, [[Ophis]] on the right cheek and [[Sular]] on the left cheek - and called on the ritualists to "give me your fear, gve me your anguish", and cast waves of force that knocked the ritualists back.

Weapons and [[Exorcism|exorcism]] did not affect the figure itself, but a casting of Pakaanan's Iron Shutters to close the portal opened by Whispers made the figure disappear. The ritualists who had been involved were spiritually wounded such that they felt trapped in the Labyrinth; an [[Exorcism|exorcism]] with the strength of seven priests behind it, as in many cases, dealt with these wounds.

Given that this figure appeared as part of a casting of [[Whispers through the Black Gate|Whispers Through the Black Gate]], it seems likely it is some sort of malign spiritual presence. What False Virtue it is a manifestation of is not certain, although Despair or something along those lines would make sense. In any case, it is a useful reminder for ritualists performing Whispers to have someone on hand to close the ritual quickly if need be, and for both ritualists and those interacting with visionaries to be alert for when exorcists are needed.

Further gave investigation into the figure identifying itself as the Eater of Hope also
information a name for the child in the vision, which is Jarith of Emrys. For further
in [[Urizen]] about this investigation, please talk to Levitia of Endsmeet [[Spire]]

#### documented in a letter to Neb Firstdance ([[Advisor on the Vallorn]] at thetime) as following the summit of Winter 378YE.

NEB

The following is a precis of my vision and surrounding work. Fuller versions are available, however at the request of my collaborator for the surrounding work, I am keeping references deliberately obscure. Something happened in my vision that is an open [[Challenge|challenge]] for Imperial Virtue and until I have run that past my spiritual advisors and the Assemblies of [[Vigilance]] and [[Wisdom]] I'm afraid the account that you [[Will|will]] get is an expurgated one.

The horoscope for my vision and surrounding work should be understood to be Wanderer surmounting Fountain crossing Phoenix.

In [[Vigilance]] I should note at this point that no part of any of this record should be understood as intended to contravene any of the Doctrines of Imperial Faith, and anybody intending to reference this work in the spirit of odological enquiry is enjoined in the strongest possible terms to go and have their damn head examined.

**My vision**

The [[Liao|liao]] process of the Gateway proceeded as usual, without difficulty. I took the pronounced as a liquid, and lost consciousness before the rune of destiny was pronounced.

The vision initiated with me standing before a table, which I took initially for a writing-desk but was in fact a image's workbench. It was illuminated between four and seven lightstones similar in design to those of [[Urizen]], and by it was clear immediately that it belonged to my past life. The room was illuminated by lightstones and decorated in sparse pastels after the Urizeni fashion, but it was too cramped and crowded to be Urizeni. It held a double bed another in one corner, a cradle at its foot containing a strangely quiet baby; in corner there was something indistinct which my Guide later informed me was some kind of garden. I could hear howling as of a high, winter wind. I do not recall any particular smell or temperature.

Before me was an unsent proof-copy of a letter to an individual whose name I have forgotten (it [[Will|will]] be recorded in Echoes v.s.) and within the edge of an instant I recognised that individual as the man referred to as "Father of my blood" in the [[Gwerin Morfa Fragment]]; I know not whether this was a truth of the vision or an inference of my own memory. First I scanned the document the quickly as I scattered the two pages on my desk, noting the sender as Councillor Merenael of the city of Emrys. If there was a date or other address, I did not see it. Upon understanding that my past life must have been reading this document at the time of the vision I read it more thoroughly. 

The document was a last and possibly desperate attempt to dissuade the councillor from Tharunind from the completion of something  called 'the Great the Work' (Merenael's capitals). It spoke of visions that Merenael's [[Coven|coven]] (the word 'coven' was used) had received by entering the Dreamscape, visions of the future that the recipient knew had been borne out before (although it did not give specifics). It foretold the coming of a great doom, not if the [[Great work|Great Work]] should fail, but if it should succeed; a doom that was already descending inescapably upon Emrys. It foretold that this doom should spread out to encompass the whole of Terunael. It provided some information speaking of a personal connection between the two councillors - that Merenael knew that the recipient's son was 'trapped' in Beantal Dol, that the [[Great work|Great Work]] was thought to have the ability somehow to help with this, but that it would not work.

As I finished perusing the document and turned to examine my surroundings, [[The Door|the door]] to [[The Chamber|the chamber]] burst open and in came an attractive man in his prime, between seventeen and eighteen hands' height, dressed in serviceable but nondescript attire that my mind recalls as being blue, a man of great personal significance to Merenael. I identified him immediately as a [[Briar|briar]] based upon the energy of his movements and what I interpreted as bark upon his face, however the content of later dreams makes me wonder if this was incorrect. The man greeted me immediately as 'Merenael' and also used a pet name 'Merri'; he referred to me as 'my love'.

All that Merenael had seen and said had come to pass, he said; the doom had come upon Emrys, had come upon us all. That she had tried her best to dissuade them, to warn them. Affected by a malign spiritual presence that I could not feel, he reported to Merenael that all hope was lost, to which Merenael replied something along the lines of 'never'. He agreed not in the broad strokes I had expected but in somewhat narrower ones, focusing upon a thing that was on my workbench, an 'elixir', his words. There should be sufficient doses left, he opined, to take us from that place and into the Dreamscape and thus to escape the doom of Emrys.

The shock of the literality of his words was enough to cause me to say another thing which Merenael had not: I asked if he truly meant to travel physically to the Dreamscape, and his response was a slightly distracted 'of course'.

Merenael refused flatly to leave her child. The man and Merenael went over to the cradle where our child lay, still arguing - Merenael said that she had failed to prevent the fall and thus she should stay, that he should take the elixir and use it to escape with their child; he refused to leave her and said that it was unknown what the effect of the elixir upon the child would be.

I felt Merenael's mind close upon the core of what she had to do; I felt the moment when she made the decision. She physically took the elixir from her husband, took his hand, and said, in I believe this order, 'Then I shall see you again, my love,' and the word 'Strength' (the latter is a mannerism observable in me). Then as he stood there in shock and disbelief she fed the elixir first to her child and then to herself, and as her husband cried out, the vision ended.

**Subsequent dreams: dream the first**
 
I was standing atop a tall tower, looking out over a city. I noted that it was a white-granite tower, and that many of the buildings of the city were also of [[White granite|white granite]], and I mused briefly upon what that substance was; I noticed further that this was my city, and that its name was Emrys, and that the of the city 'Emrys' name
was so spelled, and that we were far to the north. I glanced up at a sphere that shed down upon me and my city a pleasing [[Summer|summer]] warmth, and I noted that this sphere was made of metal. And outside the walls of my city there was a [[Forest|forest]].

Abruptly a crossbow bolt came from nowhere and buried itself in my stomach. And from that bolt, plant life burst, striking out with hatred and growing uncontrollably in all directions to consume the city. I was lifted up by this torrent of life and I was carried forwards; I was carried at the head of this surging torrent as it flowed onwards to consume all before it.

**Dream the second**

I was walking in Emrys, among its towers and arches, under the dim ember-glow of the sphere of metal otherwise known as the Redgold Sun, and I marked that that was not merely a description but its name. The stars above, I noticed, were alien to me; I am unfamiliar with the Dreamscape and know not the significance of this sight, but in my dream it did not trouble me overly. I was walking towards the pillar of the Redgold Sun, but I was never able to reach it.

The streets and plazas of Emrys were empty as I walked them, and noted this
fact as strange.

Between the towers and arches, keeping pace with me and allowing itself to be seen only occasionally, was a red-gold tiger the size of an ox, an animal in physical prime of life. Somehow I knew it was no coincidence that I was seeing the it.

Abruptly I came face to face with a man I knew, and I knew that he was the one the tiger sought. He appeared in his fifties or thereabouts, but he was a [[Changeling|changeling]]: he could have been much older. And I knew him, I knew him immediately as Merenael's husband Fallahd - and once again an awareness that was [[Mine|mine]] and yet had not lived my life provided me with the exact spelling of her name and his even as she mourned for the loss of the man's youth. Branded on his forearms were [[Diras]] and [[Wyr]], and again the ancient awareness impressed these [[Runes|runes]] upon my mind like clay in case I did not know what they were, and in that instant I recalled things I had never learned - old, old [[Magic|magic]], the [[Runes|runes]] and the patterns that we traced and drew around and over and through them as we wove our work to Night, a poetry of physicality quite unknown to my waking mind, and I believe that had I not already been an accomplished [[Magician|magician]], I'd still have understood it all just as well.

Somehow at the same time as this, from outside the city there rose a high, uluating wail, and the ember-glow of the Redgold Sun winked out, and the pillar upon which it stood cracked and slumped to one side. And [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]] came in over the walls of Emrys. I do not know if I knew the name '[[Vallorn|vallorn]]' from my own work or if Merenael knew it. Nevertheless it was exactly as [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]] is. I cannot rightly describe it. A tide of life, a tide of hatred, a tide of death. The horror destroyed and consumed my city.

And Fallahd cried out Merenael's name and raised a disbelieving hand and his body rippled and changed, his jaw distended, his remaining eye popped and flowed it down his face, and out and through him ripped the giant red-gold tiger and it came for me, and I was struck by the deep and abiding impression, almost as if spoken: dead, undead, unliving, eternally trapped.

In my dreams ever since I have been hunted by a giant red-gold tiger; sometimes it has shown itself to me in waking hallucinations. I awake refreshed, empowered, enlivened - the tiger speaks to the [[Spring]] in blood and every morning I awaken with a surge of inhuman power. Such things are familiar to me: they usually happen around [[Dawn|dawn]] following an all-nighter, or if I have visited the [[Winter Realm|Winter realm]] or otherwise been drained. I believe the effect to be a lesser version of the [[Dreamscape of the Endless Hunt]].
