From cross referencing the previous documents a few things stand out that can hopefully be further investigated and verified with time:

The cities of Terunael worked together but had differing outlooks, each settlement was shaped by its environment and dealings with other nearby civilisations. They did however agree on the best way to run their cities.

Governed by mage councils (practitioners of magic, artisans and the leaders of their armies) the cities thrived and made many great developments both magical and mundane. The gold sun of Emrys, the heating within their mines and the curious tapping of magical energies in Ghita's Veils all speak to their magical acumen and the fact they taught the Axou building techniques such as aqueducts tells us that they were skilled architects.

Thanks to past life visions and supporting rituals not only do we know the cities were run by councils we also know additional details on some of the noteworthy individuals at the time of the fall.

Merenael of Emrys, who was married to Fallahd and fled to the Dreamscape with her child Jarith of Emrys after premonitions of the doom The Great Work would bring.

Amrillin is the potential name of a councillor of Tharunind. Marenael tried to warn him not to cast the ritual. They speak of his son, Coram Terayne, who he had sent to trade with the Gwerin Morta near Beantol Dol. Coram wished to return home but had become trapped either by barbarian assault or the birth of the Vallorn)

The council of one city - most likely Tharunind given the details of Father Drakov's past life visions (proximity to Beantol Dol and Urizen was formed of a human Female General, a draughir male artisan, a changeling male general, a human male referred to as magus, Father Drakov himself and his 'aide' who may have been simply an aide or another member of the council bringing it to six. The human male, Father Drakov or the aide are likely the individual Merenael wrote to to warn about The Great Ritual.

In The Treaties on the Life of Navarr (see page 127) the excerpt from Pyre Blackroot's diary notes a Magister Naliath of Therunind. This is also potentially a name of one of the three individuals named above.

Pyre Blackroot also speaks of his grandmother, Nightshade, who was once Artificer Nirvil of Hacynian.

One Magister is believed to be the father of Star, the Vate of Spring and Summer who travelled with Navarr and Thorn. He may have been a Magister in Seren though his roots are believed to be in Cavan.

The people of Terunael were Prideful, though it became an Arrogance that was arguably a large factor in their downfall. They were convinced of their superior magics that would see them through any hardships. They not only stubbornly forged new cities in hostile environments they used threats of their large rituals as a weapon. They demanded tributes from their neighbours and took slaves from other cultures. It is little wonder that in the end they were sure that they could control the very nature of the Spring realm itself and harness the power of the Wanderer.
