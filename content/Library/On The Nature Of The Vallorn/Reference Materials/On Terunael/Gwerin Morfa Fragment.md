Father of my blood,

The [[Gwerin Morfa]] are taking the brunt of the orc attack. I do not think they [[Will|will]] hold out past [[Winter|winter]]. They [[Fight|fight]] like cornered rats, but they have no match for the cunning and cruelty of the beasts. Some captains [[Fight|fight]] with them. If they are called away, the Gwerin Morfa [[Will|will]] collapse within a season. I know the council has asked for more aid from Tharunind. Even if that aid comes the captains will certainly be encouraged to join the main campaign and leave them to meet their destiny alone. They will not leave their marshes to fight alongside the host of Béantal Dol. The council will not order out warriors to fight alongside the Gwerin Morfa.

I have spoken to the councillors and reminded them how important it is to keep the marshes out of orc hands. They refuse to accept the danger. They say that there is a plan that will solve the orc problem once and for all- I do not know if they believe what they are saying. While their [[Magic|magic]] has been good at removing the poison the orcs favour I think some of their [[Magic|magic]] has proven more hindrance than aid.

If the orcs take the rest of [[The Marches|the marches]] it will be very hard to reclaim them. It will mean the end of the Gwerin Morfa. Those who do not die will be slaves. Those who flee will join the refugees beating at the city gates. The orcs will scatter the marsh with fortified refuges. They will be free to attack and then retreat to their defences. They will wear the defenders away like rain on a rock.

This promises the end to trade with the Gwerin Morfa. This season the harvest was almost half what was predicted. Gwerin Morfa die or take up arms rather than gather [[Dragonbone|dragonbone]]. The Pennaith told me that the people are unhappy. They want to use their asgwrn ddraig to make weapons against the orcs. If you want to continue trading you should offer them weapons and armour. A gift of a Hacynian blade will win the Pennaith over in the short term.

I say that you should not bother. By this time next year those we have dealt with will be fled. Or they will be dead, or they will be gathering that asgwrn ddraig for the orcs with eyes full of dread. We will make a sound profit from our other trades with the city but I predict that the wealth these trades bring in will continue to fall.

My wife has read the portents. She is convinced that the city, will fall before our child is born. It is impossible for the orcs to capture Béantal Dol in six short months. But her visions have served us well so far. There is something wrong in Béantal Dol. It is like a fog of dread that clings to everything. I want my daughter to be born somewhere where she does not have to be afraid all the time. I want her to grow up in a place where she need never hear the drums at [[Night|night]].

I want to let you know that I will leave the city within the season. I am going to return to Tharunind. If you do want to continue to trade with the Marshfolk you will need to send someone else. I would like to formally present myself as a candidate to take over the aur gwaed trade with the mountains. I will be glad to trade with people who speak the true [[Language|language]], not a thousand year dead tongue nobody else understands. If I never hear the Marshfolk tongue again I will die glad.

Your son in blood
