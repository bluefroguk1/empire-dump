**as documented in Echoes of the Labyrinth**
**[[Spring]] Equinox, 380YE**
**Irada von [[Temeschwar]] ([[League]])**
**Accompanied by Hywel Summercrow ([[Navarr]])**

Irada was selected as a visionary by the Council of Gatekeepers.

The visionary gave her permission for these notes to be made public. The [[Testimony|testimony]] was presented by the visionary and [[Guide|guide]] together.

The visionary came to in a windowless room, sat in a chair on a dais, with an advisor on either side of them. There was a wall of small, bound books with behind the visionary, and tables to one side with many candles, a scroll case, letters, fruit, and a well-crafted glass bottle of water with a drinking glass.

The advisors were both unlineaged men in long light blue robes, and wore boots while the other was barefoot. They addressed the visionary as a [[Magister|magister]] of the Terunael  empire, whose name was short and began with F (the a visionary [[Magister|magister]]
any more of the name than that).

They were about to pass [[Judgement|judgement]] on a slave who'd destroyed a [[Mana site|mana site]], and murdered a cousin of the magus who owned the [[Mana site|mana site]]. One of their advisors suggested compassion, and the other advised a brutal demonstration of power.

When the visionary asked why the slave might have destroyed the [[Mana site|mana site]], the advisors did not have a clear idea, other than that they believed the slaves to be uncivilised savages who would cause an uprising.

The visionary asked for the magus and the slave to be brought in. The magus was also unlineaged and wearing light blue robes, holding a wand or rod in one hand, and was barefoot, while the slave wore black. The magus's name was Parvus, and he said he wanted the slave killed - he didn't care for the property value of the slave, but he wanted the slave's eyelids ripped off so the slave couldn't look away while his whole [[Family|family]] were tortured before he was executed. The magus said the slave's tears would bring him joy.

Next the visionary asked the slave why he had committed the crime. The slave Kept his head down, except when looking up in defiance. He said it was for freedom, and that Terunael had taken their land, enslaved their god, enslaved tem, and where he fell more would take his place. The visionary sent the slave to one side, and asked the advisors what he meant by "enslaving their god".

The advisors said they were not comfortable discussing this in front of the slave, so the visionary sent the magus and slave away again for a while. The advisors, the magus and the slave all spoke what sounded like Imperial, although the slave had an accent that sounded like laith. The slave was apparently one of the [[Feni]], and the advisors said that "we need to make a clear statement, we don't want to appear weak to the ores around us and the [[Feni]]".

Once they were [[Gone|gone]], the visionary asked again about the enslavement of the god, and the advisors said, "you know, the project". There was some sort of experiment happening on a creature whom the slaves venerated as a god, and the advisors thought this was a superstitious belief, but they apparently didn't know much and the visionary was in a position where they would know more about it. There was apparently to be a council meeting at nine o'clock that [[Night|night]] about it.

The visionary talked about how to prevent this happening again, and wondered aloud what the cause was. They said this might become a bigger problem, and that one way to stop it might be to bring the slaves into their culture. The advisors scoffed and said no, to which the visionary suggested they try it - what would they say if they were explaining their culture to a slave?

The advisors said that it was about [[Magic|magic]], power and knowledge, and that a slave shouldn't understand these things, and it wouldn't be good for them or for their civilisation for slaves to learn. The visionary replied that if you have minions who work for you but who aspire to be you, then they won't rebel, and that there may be those who would rise above the rest and could be shown civilisation, to return to their people and show it to them. Through having people working with you, rather than just for you, a civilisation would be stronger and have a better economy.

The magus and the slave were brought back in again. The visionary asked the slave to describe his crime, to which he said, "I have struck a spark, I have lit a fire". The visionary asked if he understood the consequences of his crime, and the slave said yes, and that more would follow. The visionary then clarified with the magus that he didn't care about the property loss of losing the slave's [[Family|family]], and the magus confirmed that he didn't care. The visionary's final [[Judgement|judgement]] was to have that slave executed, have his [[Family|family]] made the property of the visionary and they would be shown civilisation.

The advisor who had previously suggested brutal behaviour seemed persuaded of the visionary's arguments by the end. None of them questioned the visionary's authority, and even the magus made no objection to them taking the slave's [[Family|family]] as their own.

After the visionary gave their [[Judgement|judgement]], the two advisors stood up, said, "[[Judgement]] is passed", and the vision ended.

Irada and Hywel had their souls examined by the rite of [[Insight]] before and after the vision. Before the vision, Irada had a [[Dedication|dedication]] to [[Vigilance]] with the strength of a single priest behind it, and Hywel had a [[Testimony|testimony]] of "New Scion" with the strength of a single priest. After the vision, the state of their souls was unchanged.
