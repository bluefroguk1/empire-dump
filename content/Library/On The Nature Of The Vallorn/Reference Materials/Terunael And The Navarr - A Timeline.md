*Much of the history of Terunael and early Navarr is difficult to date precisely, however Imperial scholars continue to work to uncover the truths of our past.*

*Presented below is a basic timeline of the Navarri people.*

**TERUNAEL**
At its height, the Terunael empire may have lasted for between a hundred and three hundred years. During this period, the orcs were slowly driven out of the heartlands of what is today the Empire. The Terunael traded and warred with other human cultures - Imperial scholars believe that the Suaq, the Kallavesi, the Ushka, the Feni, and the Urizen, or their forebears, were all present in some form or another during this time along with several cultures that no longer exist about whom we have only fragmentary records - such as the Gwerin Morfa. This period ends with the catastrophic Fall, and the creation of [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]].

**CHAOS**
After the fall of Terunael, the lands of the Bay of Catazar descended into chaos. Following the calamity, the barbarian orcs, who had largely been pushed out of the central lands, swept back in. A great many humans were enslaved, or killed, and their continued invasions sped the collapse of whatever infrastructure had survived the Bane of Terunael. Those human cultures who survived were isolated or lived in places the orcs were not interested in - the Suaq and Kallavesa in the north-west, the Ushka in the north-east, and the Urizen in the south-east.

**PRE-IMPERIAL**
Three waves of colonization brought people that founded new human nations. The Highborn are generally held to be the first, landing in the south, while the forebears of Dawn and The Marches settled in the east. Some scholars suggest that after Steinr and Vard appeared in the north during this period, the foundation of Highguard, but there is no true consensus one way or another.

When the first waves of human colonization began, most of the initial inhabitants (sometimes called the People of the North) were in retreat - the Navarr to their forests, the Urizen to their mountains, the Suaq and the Kallavesi to the inhospitable north, the Ushka huddled around their camp fires, and the Feni lurking in their wilderness. There were also humans living among the orcs, largely as chattel, slaves or subjects. Where these humans were freed from orc oppression, they were usually assimilated by the conquerors leaving no records of their own culture.

These nations grew in size and power through constant warfare with their neighbours, particularly the barbarian orcs who claimed the land as their own. While the nations were successful, life was hard and brutal for the initial settlers and historians believe that it was only a matter of time before these new human nations would have been overrun and subjugated, like their predecessors.

**YEAR ZERO**
While many scholars disagree on how long passed between the fall of Terunael and the rise of the Empire we know today most evidence seems to support the fact that the Time of Chaos and Pre-Imperial time periods spans centuries (and not thousands of years as some romanticised tales declare)

It is in what is known as Year Zero that with an eye to the conflict between the human nations and the risks posed by the orcs, the First Empress began her crusade in Highguard. She gathered around a small group of like-minded individuals from various nations and with their assistance, and with the aid of the Navarr, she brought together the leaders of humanity to discuss the barbarian threat. Her vision and charisma - and the hard work of her allies - convinced many of them to recognise the value of an Empire. The people of Urizen declined to join, but sufficient folk from The Brass Coast, The League, Dawn, Highguard, Navarr, Varushka, Wintermark and The Marches accepted the proposal to allow them to form the Empire.

*(22 YE - 34 YE) Reign of Emperor Giovanni, "the Peacemaker"*
After the death of the First Empress, Emperor Giovanni of Tassato was chosen by the Senate to
replace her. An advisor to the late Empress, Giovanni was a statesman and politician rather than
a military leader like his predecessor. He set about ensuring the Empire had the infrastructure required to help it prosper. His first act was to initiate a tradition of meeting once every three months at the site of the first meeting where the Empire was formed. A Senate building was built on the site, and it was declared Imperial Territory.

*(27 YE) Reclamation of Miaren*
After fifteen years or so of active preparation, some of which spearheaded by the vate Rhonwen (see later documents on Rhonwen's Fall), the Navarr destroyed the vallorn of Miaren with a
combination of military might and potent rituals. The city of Seren was recovered and became a center for investigation of both vallorn and the history of Terunael for the next hundred years.

*(36 YE - 69 YE) Reign of Empress Richilde, "the Sun Queen"*

*(71 YE - 91 YE) Reign of Empress Teleri, "the Pious"*
This Navarr Empress was deeply involved in the business of the Synod, and it was during her reign that they first began to exert the political powers they possessed. During her reign, the Synod gained increasing influence over all other parts of Imperial life, especially the Imperial Senate.

*(92 YE - 102 YE) The First Interregnum*

*(103 YE - 120 YE) Reign of Empress Aenea, "the Builder"*

*(125 YE to 167 YE) Reign of Empress Varkula, called "the Undying"*

*(168 YE to 179 YE) Reign of Emperor Frederick, called "the Philosopher"*

*(180 YE to 199 YE) Reign of Emperor Barabbas*

*(200 YE - 209 YE) Reign of Emperor Nicovar "the Mad"*
The first reversals in the Empire's fortune occurred during the reign of Emperor Nicovar. Initially a brilliant administrator, Nicovar expanded the role of the civil service in support of the Empire. However, a decade of attempting to micromanage every element of the Empire, as well as a reliance on the magic of Day to gather and interpret ever greater amounts of information, eventually caused him to descend into madness.

The draughir Emperor became increasingly unstable, perceiving patterns in events that appeared paranoid to others. His unpopular policies divided the Senate and the Synod, and there were rumbles of civil war. He began to demand extreme amounts of record keeping and it became clear that he was not in his right mind.

Things came to a head in 209 when Emperor Nicovar sent his troops to burn down the Empire's libraries. There was a revolt, which culminated in the destruction of the central repository of records in Highguard and several key spires in Urizen. The mad emperor was executed by the captain of his own guard, the Navarr Thorn Isaella. Despite appeals for clemency from the Synod, Isaella took full responsibility. She was convicted as a traitor, but at the same
time was both lauded as an exemplar of courage and duty, and a hero of the Empire.

The destruction of the libraries left a big hole in the history of the Empire - thousands of books and scrolls were lost. While records still existed, there were many gaps and those that remained were fragmentary. Since then scholars have attempted to recreate the books and records they had lost, but with mixed success.

*(212 YE - 234 YE) Reign of Empress Mariika*

*(239 YE - 248 YE) Reign of Emperor Guntherm*

*(249 YE - 257 YE) Reign of Empress Brannan*
The Navarri Empress Brannan followed Guntherm to the Throne, and was another military-minded ruler dedicated to smashing the orcs and expanding the borders of the Empire. Ultimately, her abusive attitude to the powers of The Throne, and allegations of improper relations with certain eternals resulted in her being the only Throne to be revoked by the Imperial Synod. Despite her failings, she showed what the Empire was capable of when sufficient resources were given to its armies. Some of the most glorious battles in Imperial history took place during her reign, and with her support the Navarr in particular made great advances in their fight to destroy the vallorn and reclaim their lost cities.

*(257 YE - 281 YE) Reign of Emperor James*

*(281 YE - 300 YE) The Second Interregnum*

*(300 YE - 318 YE) Reign of Empress Deanne*
Empress Deanne ended the Second Interregnum by taking the Throne in 300 YE, primarily in response to increased orc aggression. Her early reign was taken up with organising a fractious and complacent Senate, and helping a largely inexperienced Military Council deal with the dual threat of Grendel invasions along the southern coast, and a major effort by the Druj in the Barrens to claim Dawnguard.

*(324 YE - 329 YE) Reign of Emperor Ahraz "the Liberator"*

*(331 YE - 346 YE) Reign of Empress Giselle "the Unwise"*

*(348 YE - 368 YE) Reign of Emperor Hugh, called "the III~Prepared"*

*(349 YE) The Empire lost control of Liathaven*

*(371 YE - 373 YE) Reign of Emperor Walter, "the Ham-fisted"*

*(374 YE - 376 YE) Coronation of Empress Britta, "the Young Empress"*

*(380 YE - 383 YE) Reign of Empress Lisabetta, "Empress of Flowers"*

*(381 YE) The Grey Pilgrims join the Navarr on the trods*

*(381YE - 383 YE) [[Reclaiming Westwood]]. The Liathaven Vallorn is pushed back*
