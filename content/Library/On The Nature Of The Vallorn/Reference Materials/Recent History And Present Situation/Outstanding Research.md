**FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF [[Historical research]]**

Last season I Commissioned the Department of Historical Research to look into the Heirs of Terunael. The information gathered by The [[Silent Bell]] has told us a lot about the present situation with the dangerous cultists and associated cabals and I felt it prudent to see if we could expand upon what was discovered by looking into the history of the group and those like it, especially given the plausible connection to Drustan/Durstan the [[Briar]] uncovered during historical research into his life. While groups like these tend to be secretive until they strike loudly hindsight may given us further [[Insight]] into their formation and motivations.

**FROM KANTOR [[Spire]], [[Axos]]**

During diplomatic talks with an [[Ambassador]] from Axos it was agreed that while The Dance of [[The Dance of [[Navarr]] and Thorn]] is a very effective tool against The [[The Vallorn]] it would serve no purpose in Axos without the Navarr to walk the trods.

However, they saw the potential in the ritual and asked if they could study it in the hopes of creating something similar that may work for them. Following some negotiations and talks amongst the vates of Navarr it was agreed that the spire be allowed a copy of the ritual text on the grounds that in exchange they were to provide copies of any Rituals) they developed to combat the [[Vallorn]] that were born of their research. If the Axou researchers are unable to create a ritual based upon the Dance then they agreed to share all of their research notes.

In the time since these negotiations the [[Spy network]] in the [[Mountains of the Moon]] was commissioned and used. While we are now aWare of a possible land route to Axos that could mean extending the [[Trod]] network to them it would require the blessing, or at least the understanding of the people of [[Tsark]] to allow for the Navarr and Grey Pilgrims to traverse their lands. Despite this there is undoubtedly merit in what they researchers have discovered so far and I intend to work with the [[Ambassador to Axos]] to receive updates on their prOgress.

**FROM THE PEOPLE OF NAVARR**

Following on from the Historical Research Request into [[Abraxus Stones]] and the support of the Navarr [[Assembly]] the virtuous citizens of Navarr have been asked to come forward if they have any information on The Vate's Shelter that was worn by Roswen Doublestep. It is through stories of our [[Heroes]] and the tools they used to combat The the Vallorn that we will be able to form increasingly effective methods of dealing with the threat.
