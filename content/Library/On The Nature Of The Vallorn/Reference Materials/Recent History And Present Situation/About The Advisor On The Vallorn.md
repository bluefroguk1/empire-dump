The Advisor on [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] is an Imperial title that was established by majority vote of the Senate in Spring 378YE. It was created in response to the fact very little was known about the Vallorn, especially by citizens who weren't Navarri.

Risks were taken and lives were lost because the enemy was often underestimated or just misunderstood.

The motion proposing the position read:

*Create the title Advisor on the Valorn, to be nominated by a unanimous decision of Navarr senators, falling back to a greater majority of the senate.*

*To have the powers: Right of Address to the Senate, right to request one item of research each summit (at standard costs) and the right to raise one free motion of Interdiction in the Conclave per summit. To receive a Stipend of 2 crowns.*

Proposed by Kahraman, seconded by Redoubt.

While approved in principle the Senate chose not to provide the Advisor with a stipend.

The Advisor is responsible for advising the Senate on matters relating to the vallorn, and protecting the Empire from the influence of this mysterious force or entity. To do this they are granted the Right of Address to make announcements to the Senate and the ability to raise a Declaration of Interdiction in Conclave without expending crystal mana.

Since the title's creation it has been held by three Navarri vates.

**MEREL PATHFINDER**
The Innovator

Following the fall of Empress Britta the skilled vate and artisan Merel Pathfinder was very vocal in the need for an advisor to the Empire when it came to the Vallorn. It was because of his proactive nature it was only natural ne be the Tirst appointed to the position. He served for just under a year, in which he strove to dispel the biggest misconceptions about the vallorn and also increase awareness of the title and its responsibilities.

It was during his tenure that one or the surviving ritual texts of the Dance of Navarr was brought to Anvil and entrusted to his care. With the assistance of Sian Eternal Associate Dean of the Lyceum at the time) he ensured that the text was added to Imperial lore so that it could be more widely learned by the vates of Navarr and not become lost again.

Merel always strives to leave a lasting positive legacy in the Empire. Prior to his heavy involvement in the creation of this title he created the first documented artifact after the death of Emperess Britta. Merel's Rod of Healing the artifact Ambergelt baton he crafted has become a part of the Empire's Warmage's regalia. The warmage may wield the rod themselves, but Merel's original intention was that it could be allocated to a worthy individual each day to ensure it saved the most lives possible.

Known by many as 'Mad Merel' if he forms a plan he believes will help people he will chase it doggedly. Many of his ideas are unorthodox but he does all he can to make them viable. On example of this is the creation of the Dredging operations in the Feverwater. In the wake of an empty throne the ability to commission many new buildings and endeavours were lost. There was no ability to commission sinecures as we do today yet Merel chose to chase his idea to hunt the dangerous reverwater for resources and perhaps items of historical import.

While the dredging only salvages a tew measures of materials each season it has on occasion provided items of historical interest including the Gwerin Morfa fragment printed earlier in this book. It could also be argued that it paved the way for future commissions such as sinecures and follys.

Merel now serves as the Granger of the Golden Orchard. a mana sinecure in Miaren but still works on a variety of endeavours to help Navarr and the Empire as a whole. While he has no intention of taking the title of Advisor on the Vallorn agam in the foreseeable tuture he still works closely with the Aavisor orterine ald where ne can.

Most recently he was instrumental in securing valuable information from the Thule, including the ritual text for the Arc of skuld.

**NEB FIRSTDANCE**
The Envoy

When Merel had to leave the position due to personal circumstance he made the recommendation to the Navarri senators that Neb Firstdance become his successor and that Siân Eternal work closely with him to aid in research. Honouring this request Neb became the second Advisor on the Vallorn in the Winter of 378YE and quickly made his voice heard.

Following and expanding on the groundwork laid down by his predecessor he vocally increased the awareness of the Vallorn and the threat it posed across all nations. He was known for his passionate and characterful speeches both in Senate and to any who sought his advice but also his forceful corrections to any who would spread misinformation about the nature of Spring magic.

He also spearheaded the initial historical research into the Vallorn. The research was sponsored by prosperity and curiosity of The Academy and while it was at the time that troubles began with The Whisper Gallery attacking Historical Researchers the important document that served as the springboard for many future investigations was secured. Despite the Whisper Gallery placing a price on his head he pushed for research to continue and fervently supported the motion to get protection for the historical researchers.

As well as discussions with the people of the Empire Neb also entered negotiations with the Druj Ghulai known as Greenmask in regards to the trods and the Vallorn as a whole. It was through his initial talks and the ingenuity of the vates of Navarr and the Imperial Orcs that ritual knowledge was wrested from Greenmask's mind and the Imperial heroes ended the Ghulai's life.

In his year and a half in the role Neb left a lasting legacy in the form of his book on the Vallorn and the 'Notes of [[The Vallorn]]' which he published every season of his tenure. These notes have been entered into Imperial records and can be accessed in most places of learning.

Impulsive to the end Neb formed a theory on the Vallorn and was last seen heading into Broceliande to do further practical research.

**SIAN ETERNAL**
The Lorekeeper

Before his disappearance Neb sent a letter to Siân Eternal, with whom he'd worked closely with throughout his tenure, asking her to act as his proxy in Anvil but also stating he was unsure when and if he would return. In the uncertainty over Neb's fate the Senators of Navarr asked Siân to officially take the position. With some reluctance she agreed under the proviso that it be 'until a better candidate was found'.

It was during the Spring Equinox of 380YE that the often reserved merrow began her tenure in the role. While her predecessors were very vocal and direct in their approaches, she took a different approach. Over sweeping announcements she favoured quieter more in depth discussion. She advised Generals, Senators, and any curious citizen directly ensuring that all their questions were answered to the best of her ability.

Already an academic Sin previously worked as the Associate Dean of the Lyceum alongside both Simargl, The Empty One and Eudaemon of Halcyon.

Already accustomed to working with the Civil Service in regards to research she made ample use of her ability to commission Historical Research. She also used this ability to work with the Ambassador to Axos, Tarquinius of Ankarien, to sponsor an expedition into Axos itself and the Vallorn there.

Keen to ensure that knowledge not be lost again and that as many people as possible be educated in not only the Vallorn itself but also the history of Navarr and Terunael she oversaw the construction of the Great Library of Hacynian. Initially a site of a Terunael library that survived the fall (only to fall to later ruin) the Great Library stands upon a regio of Day and Night magic within Mourning Hollow. Both Phaleron and Sung hold interest in the site but despite requests from both Eternals to be allowed some dominion over the regio in the end it was devoted entirely to the Empire and its custodianship granted to the Advisor on the Vallorn.

As well as Historical Research and Expeditions Siân also followed other paths to unearth as much information as she could on the Vallorn itself but also the circumstances of its creation and what has been done in the past to try to contain and eradicate the threat. As well as documenting results of various divination rituals and speaking to people with firsthand knowledge of the threat she secured a favour from the Celestial Library, Phaleron. After some discussion with the people of Navarr she eventually secured a biography on the life of Navarr written in the early days of the Empire in exchange for her favour.

It was during her tenure that both Navarr and Thorn were recognised as exemplars of Wisdom and Ambition respectively. While the majority of the work on these recognitions was done by Erasmo di Tassato, Madog and Elowen of Exile's End sporting evidence and advice was provided by Siân.

Trough research and discovery further investigation into the relationship between vallornspawn and the soul was endorsed. It was during this investigation that Raewyn Eternal was able to insight a husk and see a soul trapped within. Knowledge of this discovery was spread through the Empire through Raewyn's words in the Synod. The priests of Highguard took this information and sought to do all they could to help these trapped souls and the Grey Pilgrims were formed. Understanding the weight of the number of trapped souls the other nations worked hard to support Highguard through their period of transition as their pilgrims took to the trods.

While mostly a quiet voice of authority Siân occasionally surprised people by being very vocal and blunt on some topics. The most notable being the approach to be taken in regards to the opportunity to push back the Vallorn in Liathaven. She spoke pointedly in front of a Standing in Anvil, especially towards Empress Lisabetta and Imperial Inquisitor at the time Corwyn Leafstalker when the removal of Brennos Brackensong's army was played off as a small spat between the General and the Throne. She was swift to point out that it wasn't a small indiscretion it was a move to halt Quiet Step so they could not strike against the Vallorn.
