**Written by Emhyr Shadowbirch, Summer 780YE**

The Heart of The [[The Vallorn]] in [[Therunin]] is based in Greenheart, the history of the [[Vallorn]] in this area is a long one. With all the crazy shit in the world at the moment, it is probably wise if I write it down for [[Prosperity]]. The stories that I was told as a child tell that The the Vallorn claimed over half of Therunin or Tharunind as it used to be called.

The Vallorn spread south taking over Sweetglades, Eastring and even East Ashes to the coast of Feverwater. One of the big questions is how The the Vallorn was fought back and why our predecessors didn't write it down. I know it is easy to blame the patrons of the [[Realm]] of Night. The Rainbow Serpent or the Courtiers, but this is our reason to be. We swore an oath to do this, all of us. Why the fuck would an entire nation forget how to do something we have done before and is the reason we exist.

Nikovarr burnt down the libraries it is said, but that would make no sense. That does not answer why everything is forgotten. The destruction of the Vallorn over two Regions and the reclaiming of them is key.

I hope that this document will allow for my thoughts and theories to be written down and that all Visitors to Return take the time to read it and heed my words.

I do not mean to speak out of turn of anyone or anything in this document but I am questioning currently held views. It is important that this is realised not as being unwise but as a sign of all of our [[Vigilance]].

The [[Druj]] seem to use some sort of stone pillar with a ritual, this creates a barrier that weakens Vallorn creatures. These pillars are supposedly Terunael in nature which would lead us to believe that they were created by our people when they first fought The the Vallorn. Again, why did we stop. The Vallorn in [[Miaren]] was destroyed completely and then we forgot how to do it. Does this make any fucking sense to anyone? This is why we need to write this down and even though it may put us at risk from the Courtiers there is nothing else we can do. If we could speak to The Foundation, I may be able to find out more, but I heard rumours that even the Deepest One will not speak about it.

**The Druj**

Ghulai named Greenmask claims to have records and artefacts from the Vallorn of Beantol Dol. It is here that he is said to have stone pillars and other artefacts that will allow him to [[Fight]] The Vallorn. Maybe it is hubris of [[The Empire]], maybe it is [[Wisdom]], that they do not work with the Druj, but there is a deeper secret here that we all know.

**The Vallorn Hearts**

Seren has been wiped out, but if that is the case then a large Terunael city with all their secrets and relics should be there. Where is the information? Where are the fucking answers? Another secret that people are not being told, that doesn't add up. There must be a greater thing happening here. Not even the Toad King could make an entire city disappeared.

**Creatures in The Vallorn**

**The Husks**

The Husks seem to be some walking dead like the creatures that you get when you cast the ritual [[Quickening Cold Meat]]. Dead bodies with Winter Spirits in that can be as foes. They're not. They are living people. The Vallorn moss and plants creeps inside a dying person, keeping them alive and using their body as a lifeless husk. It is possible that they could be saved, but they are dying anyway. Killing them actually will mean that the Vallorn husk cannot move.

These are our friends and [[Family]] (or orc's friends and families I guess) they feel and see everything, they are in pain and we have to kill them. Some of them go on for years in the state of dying and pain and we cannot get into the Forests to always execute your foe. Friends or foes. The Vallorn will take the dying but can not take the dead. It is a mercy for them.

The Husks themselves seem to be slow moving but this is not quite the case. They are without purpose until they sense food, something that is not part of the Vallorn. Then they will travel toWards that person or creature and devour them. If they can taken down they will grow back, even limbs will grow back.

The deeper into the Vallorn they are, the stronger and faster they are. They do have one [[Weakness]] though. An enVenomed wand or knife will destroy them with a single blow and they will not be able to get back up. This will also kill the unfortunate they have controlled.

Some of the Vallorn husks I have seen recently have purple growths on them. These growths are unusual and the creatures seem stronger, but I do not know if that is true. If I was to hazard a guess I would say that the ones with the growth have a more animalistic intelligence and will back off and move away from large groups. I have not seen or heard of these before and it is a worry but the Vallorn changes, there are always new creatures.

**Dryads**

Never let a [[Briar]] go anywhere near a Vallorn. I am not a briar hater. They were born tainted with Spring [[Spring magic]] and its not their fault, but get them to leave the [[Navarr]] and go as far away from the Vallorn as possible. Otherwise you get dryads, and no-one wants fucking dryads. When a briar becomes a husk they grow naturally strong, sometimes they develop bark that gives them protection the same as ringmail armour, sometimes they grow to up to seven foot tall, and they have been known to be able to rip through hunting leathers with claws or talons.

They never stop growing and are large and aggressive.

**Ents**

Sometimes a dryad will be left for hundreds of years. The Dryads keep growing to the monstrous creatures known as Ents. It is thought that their bark is as strong as platemail, that they can knock people to the ground with a single blow and that they can destroy shields. They are so large that venomous blows seem to make them angry but do not drop them as instantly as with the lesser creatures. They are fucking nasty and they should be avoided unless you have a large group of [[Heroes]] of the Empire with you, maybe some collected through a [[Sentinel Gate]] from [[Anvil]] would be able to deal with them, but Goreu told me once that not even [[Inga Tarn]] herself could destroy one.

**Recent Changes to the Vallorn**

The Vallorn is moving, there is no doubt of this in my mind. In fact it is moving into this Valley. This happened just before Autumn but the Miasma came first, spreading forward [[Into the valley]] and infecting all that people saw, then came the Ettercaps and the Umberhulks. Tunneling through the Vallorn and the ground to appear from nowhere. The bug creatures create these tunnels that seem to act like trods, filling those that go through them with a rush of Spring [[Magic]] and moving them through quickly as walking through the trods. This means once an Umberhulk has burrowed through the land the Husks and Ettercaps can erupt from it.

Rangara's Cauldron was first. I do not like to assign sentience to the Vallorn but it definitely seemed drawn there. The plants grew from the Sprores quicker than any that I've seen. The husks with the purple markings started appearing and then they got braver. I am not sure that [[Courage]] is something I can apply to plants inhabiting the dying corpses of my friends, but that's what happened. They started attacking steadings. Stridings were ambushed (again sentience is implied) but they were taken unawares.

The Vallorn here has awoken and its gaining land once again, and we don't have a fucking clue how to stop it. Patience and walking the trods will not solve this, we have to send in our armies, to destroy it and be prepared to pay the sacrifice.

I will try to add more to this next season.
