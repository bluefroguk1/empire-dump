By Dr Cadfael [[Eternal]].

**First Principles.**

As a surgeon or healer, you [[Will|will]] deal with [[Vallorn]] related conditions from two sources, Gross injury from [[Vallorn|vallorn]]-infected creatures and the effects of the Miasma.

Note carefully that miasma is all pervasive and intrusive. Masks and other screens might slow or reduce infection or affliction but DO NOT prevent it.

Fortunately, barring massive infection, I have yet to see any secondary infection of attending medics outside of the area of the miasma.

**Gross Injury**

Gross Injury may be treated in likewise manner to any physical injury but, I stress, any open wounds must be checked for spores, seeds, [[Venom|venom]] or other alien or unknown elements and dealt with promptly and appropriately. A wash of [[Bladeroot]] or similar cleanser has, in my experience, proved effective but do not assume it has worked without secondary inspection.

Envenomation is all too common as both a primary and secondary factor in [[Vallorn|vallorn]] related attacks. This may and should be treated by either correct application of [[Imperial Roseweald]] or use of [[Ritual]] [[Magic|magic]].

All too often fighters [[Will|will]] unaware or indifferent to being envenomed. As a healer, it is your duty to treat them regardless of obstinance or ignorance.

**Miasmic Conditions**

Personal observation and treatment thereof have shown, to date, three main manifestations of having been present in a miasmatic area.

**Green Lung** is caused by inhalation of spores, this results in both internal growth of fungal-seeming tendrils and the rapid and life-threatening production of fluids and phlegm in the lungs and throat. It may be treated by a hot infusion of [[Bladeroot]], where the inhalation of the vapours from the infusion are VITAL. Reports on the amount of infusion/[[Bladeroot]] required per patient are unclear and confusing. This surgeon recommends not stinting and using a full measure of Bladreoot per patient.

**Green Vein** (my name) has been seen to result from both injury and miasmatic infection of open sores or wounds. In this unpleasant condition, areas of the vascular (blood circulation) system begin to turn green and swollen as plant threads grow within them. The only solution so far is to open the blood vessel and physically remove the threads and the spawning spores.

**Green Eye** (my name) is caused by spores affecting the moisture around the eyes, resulting in thread growth both in and behind the eye itself. The only solution so far is to physically extract the eye from the socket and manually remove the growth. The application of a cooled [[Bladeroot|bladeroot]] infusion (surplus from treating Green Lung) [[Will|will]] also provide a cleansing and soothing effect before restoration of the eye.

You [[Will|will]] note my use of 'plant threads' as a term. Be aware that spore affliction can manifest as small green threads but also as vines, fungal blooms and doubtless other floral manifestations.

As always exercise due diligence and after treating an afflicted patient thoroughly wash your tools and hands.

Also be aware as a healer that [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]], in its foul abundance, might yet manifest in forms of life unseen and unknown to Imperial Medicine and knowledge. If you should encounter a new manifestation, I urge you to spread knowledge and awareness of it with due Virtue. Lives may be spared by your swift, Wise and Loyal action.
