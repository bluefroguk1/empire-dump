It is hard to compile a book on a topic that is still being researched. We are constantly striving to gain more knowledge on the phenomenon that is The [[The Vallorn]], how it came to be and how it can be ended. It has been less than two years since I first completed the first iteration of this book, while those Early issues did not include copies of all the supporting research documents I did my utmost to present the facts as they were known at the time. The beginning of this book has received a few small edits over time to reflect more information coming to light and I have no doubts that future issues will evolve further.

I questioned when the correct time to publish a 'Researchers Edition' might be given that there will always be [[Outstanding Research]] to be added but now felt like the right time. In the wake of our better understanding of vallornspawn husks, seeing how Yaw'nagrah has influenced the situation and the push back of the [[Vallorn]] in [[Liathaven]] it feels that now more than ever people need to be fUlly aWare of the scope of the vile threat to [[The Empire]] that is The the vallorn.

That said for the sake of being as complete as possible I am dedicating the next pages to research that is currently underway and some of the possibilities for other routes of enquiry. I will also be including some additional blank pages at the back of the book should you wish to make notes or affix copies of newer research.
