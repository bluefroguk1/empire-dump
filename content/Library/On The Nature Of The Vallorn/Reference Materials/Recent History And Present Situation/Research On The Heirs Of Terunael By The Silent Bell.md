Autumn 383YE

The Heirs of Terunael are traitors to the dream of the Navarr. Most recently they helped drive the chaos in the Liathaven and Brocéliande, working with the monstrous Children of Yaw'nagrah to spread the vallorn's terrible green grasp.

With their defeat in Brocéliande, the assumption is that they will be forced to fall back... and assumption that could have been dangerously premature.

Fortunately, the vigilance of the Assembly of Nine has set the Silent Bell to investigate their activities - and discovered that far from receding they are gathering in force in Therunin, Hercynia, and Liathaven. Now they are poised to drive the vallornspawn into a murderous frenzy that, while it won't spread the vallorn's infestation, could be disastrous for the Navarr nation.

**Overview**

The Silent Bell are a loose affiliation of pilgrims from every nation devoted to the virtue of Vigilance. In addition to the core membership there are supporters and affiliates in every part of the Empire. During the Summer Solstice, the Assembly of Nine sent the Silent Bell to investigate the dangerous group who call themselves the Heirs of Terunael - a timely decision as it turns out.

The so-called Heirs of Terunael appear to be humans - predominantly with briar lineage - who wish to spread the influence of the vallorn for some reason. There is some evidence that this group is just the latest iteration of a conspiracy that has been active in the Empire - especially among the Navarr - for years. Groups such as the Whispering Drays - a gathering of briars who sought some mad communion with the vallorn - may have been influenced by the Heirs of Terunael. There is some evidence that survivors of these groups, and others like them, have come together in loose alliance with the Heirs to put their various unhinged schemes into operation.

They are best known for their involvement in the recent chaos in Liathaven and Brocéliande, working in collusion with the Children of Yaw'nagrah to spread the vallorns through those territories. With their defeat in Brocéliande, the assumption is that they will be forced to regroup and provide a degree of respite to the Empire... an assumption that could have been dangerously premature.

Fortunately, the vigilance of the Assembly of Nine has been rewarded. Far from falling back, the Heirs of Terunael appear to be doubling down on their insane schemes. They have already gathered in force in Therunin and Hercynia - perhaps explaining why they were relatively absent in the recent fight in Brocéliande. There are even reports of what appears to be activity by the Heirs in Liathaven and perhaps even further afield.

According to the Silent Bell, the Heirs have largely abandoned Brocéliande, focusing their attention elsewhere. They also appear to have changed their tactics somewhat. Rather than attempting to spread the vallorn, they are focusing their efforts on the multitude of beasts that dwell within it - the vallornspawn. If not for the foresight of the Assembly of Nine the Empire would have been taken entirely by surprise - as it is there is some chance to prepare for the imminent attacks.

One piece of good news is that while the Green Mother may be allied to the Heirs of Terunael, her ability to support their efforts directly is heavily constrained by the Conclave who have declared her to be an enemy of the Empire. Unfortunately, this does nothing to prevent her providing the Heirs of Terunael with boons and gifts they may use to pursue their goals, nor to stop those idolatrous fools who worship the Mother of Briars.

**Hercynia**

The first gathering of the Heirs of Terunael that the Silent Bell have identified is in Hercynia. Initially gathering in the Treji, and in the southern woods, they have also send expeditions deep into the heart of the vallorn - into Deer's Folly.

It has been some years since the vallorn of Hercynia has been active, but its infrequent excursions have been of unmatched viciousness.

Right now, the Silent Bell can confirm as many as sixty Heirs of Terunael moving around the borders of Deer's Folly, with no way to tell how many more may be in the depths of the region. The Heirs have already begun rousing the ettercaps and vallornspawn that dwell in the dark heart of Hercynia. There have been a few scattered encounters already - a steading in Summersend assaulted; a striding in the Glen of Shadows decimated while pausing on the borders of the vallorn.

The Silent Bell are also concerned that there are Heirs of Terunael - or sympathisers - hiding in plain sight in the steadings of Hercynia prepared to sow chaos through acts of sabotage and murder as soon as the vallornspawn begin to move. Even more worryingly, there have been reports of at least two groups of Varushkan cabalists coming along the eastern road into Treji before disappearing. The SIlent Bell's resources are stretched, but it does appear at least one of these groups belonged to the ominously titled "Cabal of the Green Mother" from northern Volodmartz.

Shortly before the Autumn Equinox, the waters of Hercynia begin to show signs that they have been infested with malign Spring magic; it does not take long for the vates to identify that someone has laid Rivers Run Red over Hercynia, bringing with it the threat of infection and sickness - and further rousing the vallornspawn's bloodlust.

The vallorn of Hercynia is contained in a single region, but its central position means that it is a serious threat to Summersend, the Glen of Shadows, and Old Ranging. Northpines is relatively secure from the vallornspawn; there has not been a major incursion into the mountains since they were first liberated and no sign the Heirs of Terunael are active in the mountain peaks. Those same mountains present a barrier between Hercynia and Hahnmark, meaning that the Silent Bell do not believe the Winterfolk will be directly threatened - not yet at any rate. If the chaos is allowed to spread however there is every chance that vallornspawn abominations might venture as far as Kalpamark or even spill out into Skarsind.

**Therunin**

If the Heirs of Terunael were only active in Hercynia, it would be bad enough... but the Silent Bell report that they are also gathering in Therunin. There are fewer Heirs here as far as the Silent Bell can ascertain - perhaps no more than fifty - but the vallorn of Therunin is considerably larger. In addition to the vallornspawn, the Heirs are riling up the great insects and there are reports of at least one vallorn-infected marshwalker along the shores of the Feverwater.

Messengers were quickly dispatched to the Great Forest Orcs in Lower Tarn Valley to warn them of the coming danger.

Worse, while the Heirs themselves are not as concentrated here it appears that they are receiving additional support from the Children of Yaw'nagrah. A Urizeni coven of briar magicians and sentinels from Peregro have come down out of the mountains and launched a precipitous attack against Peakedge Stead.

Their assault was supported by lesser heralds of Yaw'nagrah no doubt called up with their ritual magic. The attack was repulsed - and went some way toward tipping the hand of the Heirs in Therunin - but most of them were able to escape back into Sweetglades.

One of the captured sentinels was questioned and while they were extremely uncooperative they provided ample evidence that the mages of Greenfountain Spire have been idolatrous worshippers of the Mother of Briars - Yaw'nagrah - for generations. Before falling silent, he raved about the Green Mother's message - that now was the time to cover the Empire in blessed trees once again and the vallorn was the tool with which to do it.

As in Hercynia, shortly before the Autumn Equinox someone raised the potent curse Rivers Run Red in Therunin. Three days after the first taint was spotted in the water, however, the magic sustaining the curse broke apart. News quickly came from the Lower Tarn Valley that the magicians of the Great Forest Orcs had taken immediate action using one of the rituals the Empire shared with them after their arrival - casting Rivers of Life to neutralise the threat posed by the pestilent Spring magic. The orcs are making their further preparations - the Spears of the Pine will protect their settlements and the building site of the Holt of the Oak.

**Liathaven**

The Silent Bell have limited resources in Liathaven, but as soon as they became aware of the threat posed in Hercynia and Therunin they were quick to send some of their agents west to check on Liathaven. They were able to confirm that there are a number of Heirs of Terunael here although its difficult to gauge how many. As Liathaven is outside the Empire, they are able to receive significant assistance from the Children of Yaw'nagrah. According to the Silent Bell, both the Heirs and the Children are operating more openly here - although they must still exercise some caution lest they attract the ire of the Jotun orcs who control the territory.

Liathaven labours under the effect of the powerful Winter magic curse laid by the Navarr themselves - but while Wither the Seed makes the vallorn and its spawn sluggish it does not prevent the Heirs and their allies from rousing the creatures. Worse, in a pattern that is now becoming predictable, as the Autumn Equinox approaches there are signs that the Heirs have raised Rivers Run Red in Liathaven as well. With nobody there to remove the ritual, and with the territory unreachable from the Imperial regio, it is likely that its full effects will be felt once the vallornspawn begin to move.

There are very few Imperial citizens left in Liathaven which is perhaps a small mercy. Those that remain will do their best to fight the vallornspawn, but they are outclassed and outnumbered and must be careful not to attract the attention of the Jotun. For their part, the orcs appear largely unaware of the threat gathering under the eaves of Liath's Heart.

Fortunately for the Empire, it seems that while the Heirs of Terunael may be able to rouse the vallornspawn, the sluggishness caused by Wither the Seed means that even if the territory is left entirely to its own devices they are unlikely to spread beyond the borders of the forests - meaning that Kahraman, Mournwold, Bregasland, and Hordalant are probably safe at least for the moment.

**The Jotun in Liathaven**

Most of Liathaven is still under control of the Jotun. It is not clear if they have any armies there at the moment, but they certainly have some presence. The Silent Bell believe that they are entirely unaware of the threat of the Heirs of Terunael. It may be possible to get a message to the Jotun and alert them to the threat. One obvious way to do this would be to use the Call Winged Messenger ritual - provided the caster has sufficient information to ensure such a message reached its destination of course. There may be other ways, but ideally such a message would be communicated to a Jotun with some influence - it will be no use sending a random ore warrior as a messenger.

Given their commitment to their thralls it is likely that with some warning the Jotun might mobilise their own troops in defence of the territory. On the other hand, if the vallornspawn butcher large numbers of their thralls and warriors in a surprise attack, they might pull out of Liathaven completely, potentially making it easier for the Empire to conquer the regions they currently control.

Technically of course offering aid to the Jotun could be considered treason -

"Aiding barbarians, eternals or foreign powers to act against the interests of the Empire" - so it might be advisable to speak to Chief Magistrate Karkovitch before doing so.

**Sküld**

The Silent Bell have reports of one final group of Heirs of Terunael taking action following the Summer Solstice, but they believe they are no longer in the Empire. There are unverified reports of what seem to be a score or so Heirs of Terunael heading north-east out of Suvretz into Otkodov - specifically into southern Sküld where a vallor is believed to lie in uneasy slumber. The easternmost territory of the Thule is beyond the remit of the Silent Bell, but they believe their information is reliable.

As with Liathaven, Sküld is not protected by the declarations of the Imperial Conclave so it is likely the Heirs would be able to secure the assistance of Yaw'nagrah with whatever scheme they are hatching in the north. It is also difficult to know whether the Thule are aware of the threat or not - or how they would respond. There is a small chance of danger to the Empire - in theory any vallornspawn raised in Sküld are as likely to come west into Volodmartz as they are to press north further into Otkodov. After all, it is believed that the vallorn does not much care for the frigid climate of the far north. Still, for the moment at least, the threat of whatever the Heirs are doing in Otkodov seems confined the Thule lands.
