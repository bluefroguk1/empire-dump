It is obvious to me that all mortals have Mortal beings have two parts to their consciousness, their Spirit and their Soul. Your soul is immortal, and is the part of you that travels through the labyrinth (or maybe crosses the great abyss in the case of the [[Imperial Orcs]]) Your spirit it the is the part of your personality that grows from the accumulation of memories of a living being. The constant accumulation of memories weighs the body down.

As people age their minds become infirm - this is because your spirit has only a certain limit it can achieve. You can only accumulate so many memories: before the weight of them simply overwhelms your spirit and crushes it. This is why we forget - more and more as we get older. This helps to protect us against the effects, but it is a dam holding back a tide.

But it is not just the mind, the body is similarly affected. Experiences weigh the body down, changing it, wearing it out as it ages. This is most obvious with grievous injuries - it can be part of someone's nature (or spirit if you prefer) can be to be a fast sprinter - but that is lost if you chop their leg off. Eventually the weight of accumulated physical experience simply degrades the inherent nature of the body until it fails completely and dies.

Some mortal creatures, like the [[Volodny]] and the [[Thule]] dragons have used [[Magic]] to make themselves undying. The Thule use powerful magic to keep their bodies alive - but only just. They are nothing but near motionless husks.

The Volodny use different methods, creating new bodies to inhabit each time the old one perishes. Both class of beings however have an essential problem with memories - they simply cannot accumulate more memories.

As a result, both are forced to dispose of unwanted memories. There are stories about them not being able to remember inconsequential details but instead to keep the important things protected. I assume the same happens with heralds and other creatures of the realms. As undying creatures, Eternals must surely suffer the same problems that mortal beings do - they can only accumulate so many memories.

I assume that this is why items such a [[Kaela]]'s book of the dead occurs or maybe even [[Phaleron]]'s library.. I would have thought that although this is important in the powerful realms, in realms such as Summer key [[Events]] are repeated with ceremony so they are constantly reminded, and I doubt in the chaos of Spring any of those creatures even care.

However, it is important to note that creatures of the realms do not have a soul.

We believe that even when someone becomes a creature such as a herald, that their spirit stays to inform and [[Empower]] the herald, keeping the memories and personality, but their soul goes to the labyrinth. It is important to note that in this case then it is the soul that is changes by experience. People do change and their nature changes, so that must be due to their soul. This would make sense because although liou can change someone's nature temporarily you cannot do it with magic, for the soul is protected in a way the spirit is not.

So your personality is part of your soul, not part of your spirit which is a reflection and storage of memories. This explains how [[Rituals]] like [[Whispers through the Black Gate]] work. When someone dies what remains, for a brief time, is their spirit. The accumulation of memories and the resulting views and attitudes that that created. Magic can contact this memory, for a period of time.

If there was terrible emotional trauma it can also cause a ghost to remain. When there is violent trauma, it can be so overwhelming that it breaks apart the essential link between the spirit and the soul. Basically, the person's personality falls to pieces, they die, but their spirit (their memories and personality) remains, burned into the world, as a ghost.

The question is, what replaces the soul in a herald. I guess part of the [[Realm]].

They lose their nature, their soul and instead become filled with the nature of the realm - for a summer [[Mage]] would become summery if they were to become a herald, but with their spirit shaping that due to sharing the memories that they had in life. The argument here is that is that people do not tend to radically change when they become heralds, merely changing slightly. I would argue that this is because to be chosen to become a herald you must be predisposed in that way already. I have never heard of a loud opinionated [[Briar]] [[Thorn]] suddenly being made a herald of the realm of day. Now it could be that that is not what the [[Eternal]] is looking for or it might be that they are not suitable and their spirit would not fit with the part of the realm that has replaced their soul.

True Liou is an interesting point here, this must allow you to access a previous spirit of your soul. Your soul has touched many spirits and memories and the true liou allows it to tap into that spirit.If your soul is what affects your personality and actions, then this is unusual. I said previously that magic cannot affect it yet there are rituals that will affect it, such as the [[Chamber of Delights]].

This does not affect your core personality though, you still feel guilt and act in the basic way but with less inhibitions. Inhibitions are not part of your personality. It is like being drunk on nettle wine, it has not changed who you are, merely influenced you in a slight way.

Finally you get husks of the Winter Realm, such as those summoned by the Winter Ritual. This takes bodies and replaces their soul with parts of the winter realm, allowing access to some of their memories but making them be the mindless servants fueled by emptiness and hunger. This is very different to the husks of The [[The Vallorn]] which are plants and moss that are within a terminal corpse, keeping it alive and stopping it from dying - so in this case they have both their spirit and their soul.

Which is more evil, it is obvious. A winter husk the soul has already passed on and it is the flesh and access to the spirit that is being used as a tool. The lack of strength of the spirit is because it is getting gradually weaker since is not compatible with the winter Realm. A Vallon husk traps the person in a state between life and death, keeping them alive but controlling their body. It is possible sometimes to talk to them although normally the [[Vallorn]] spores will not allow it or the person is in too much pain to be comprehensible in any way.

These are at least my ponderings, I do not know how I would go about proving any of these thoughts

**Addendum by Sian Eternal:**

The above document was found at the Steading of Return. While it is formed mostly of theorising it has since been confirmed that vallornspawn hold the souls of those it has taken.

At Return Ceinwen Eternal was gifted a magical item by the eternal [[Meraud]] that allowed her to use the Speak With Dead spell upon the husks there. It allowed her to call forth the person trapped within, they were not only aWare of their lives before but also had an awareness and regret for their actions after becoming vallornspawn.

After this discovery through the bravery of a group of [[Navarr]] a vallornspawn was contained and Raewyn Eternal was protected whilst she performed the Rite of [[Insight]] upon it, seeing the soul trapped within.
