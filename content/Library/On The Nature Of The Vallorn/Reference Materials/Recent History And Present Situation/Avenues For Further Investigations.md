There are many paths we can take in learning more about Terunael and The [[The Vallorn]] and this list is by no means exhaustive, I include this list here to share what I intend to research in the near future. If you wish to undertake any of these avenues of investigation, please be sure to collaborate with myself and future AdVisors on the [[Vallorn]] to ensure resources aren't being squandered by multiple groups following the same leads.

#### TOPICS FOR [[Historical research]]

**Emnity against [[Sadogua]].**

Further to Cybi Farkas' account on discussing it with [[Leviathan]] it is possible that historical research may uncover more of the facts surrounding the [[Declaration]] of Emnity against Sadogua during the first century of [[The Empire]].

If any accounts of discussions within Conclave at that time could be unearthed then we would have a potentially clearer view of the [[Eternal]]'s role in the fall of Terunael.

**Terunael Sites**

There are several sites of Terunael origin that little is known about that could be investigated further. Prime examples of this are The Paths of Lan Th√∫ven, The Gate of Summer and Boar's Hollow.

**Other Sites of Interest**

Other locations within the Empire that are [[Worth]] consideration when it comes to research are the Pool of Silver Clouds, the Earthworks of Liaven's Glen (though arguably this would have been easier to do when they were not under the control of the [[Jotun]]) and any information on Turning [[Spiral]] Library and the final fates of the researchers there.

**Historical Figures**

In the Historical Treaties compiled by Morfran Ravenswatch in 172YE other historical figures are mentioned that could be researched One is Pyre Blackroot whose diaries spoke of the life of [[Navarr]] including tales of his grandmother, Niyril of Hercyniand who took on the name Nightshade when she became an Early member of the nation of Navarr. Another is [[General]] Brawdwr Gryphonstand and his army the Bronze Gryphon, it is said that the General met Navarr herself. Finally, the ancient Firstdance [[Striding]], especially their early history and the lives of Ffion and Enthis (and her partner Prys)

**STORIES OF STAR**

There are stories of Star, the compatriot of Navarr and [[Thorn]], that have yet to be widely shared. The people who are likely most knowledgeable of these tales are the now freed Artisans of Treji, in particular Eirwen Stones Rest if she could be found.

**MORE INFORMATION ON [[Abraxus Stones]]**

Following the historical research into [[Abraxus]] Stones there are still two routes of further investigation that could be explored. Firstly, the material components used in the creation of the Sarcophan variant of the talisman. This information could be potentially procured through diplomatic relations with the [[Sarcophan Delves]].

Secondly, the talisman known as the Swan's Chalice. Discussions with the Ylenrith could yield more information on the eternal's involvement in not only that particular [[Abraxus Stone]] but the nature of the talismans in general.

**QUESTIONS FOR LEVIATHAN**

The ritual Swim Leviathan's Depths is a very valuable resource in discovering information about the past, however the questions asked during the casting should be kept very precise and in accordance with the wording of the ritual itself. Some potential questions to ask include:

*"Why did the Terun unravel the trods?"*

It is probable that the people of Terunael saw what they had created with their great ritual and worried that by keeping The the Vallorn hearts connected that they were worsening the situation. However there have been more to their decision and the initial relationship between the trods and the Vallorn.

*"Why did all eight Terunael cities feel sufficiently threated at the same time to enact the Great Ritual?"*

The cities of Terunael were widespread, they spanned not only the Empire as we know it today but into lands beyond. It begs the question how and why all eight of the cities chose to enact the Great Ritual at the same time. Evidence we have so far suggests that the cities came to their own decisions over whether it was time or not to put their plan into action or not.

Did the decision of one city force the hands of the others or were they all feeling sufficiently overwhelmed at the same time? It's possible that by asking these questions we can paint a better picture of the Terun cities in those moments before the Fall.

*"Why did [[Emperor Nicovar]] purge the Terun descendants in [[Axos]]?"*

We know that Emperor Nicovar was exacting in his destruction of information, what isn't clear however is why he went to the effort to eradicate the Terun descendants of Axos. It would have taken significant effort to not only find them but to dispatch troops that far to deal with them.

*"Why are the people of [[Tsark]] so secretive?"*

There is a lot that we do not know about the [[Mountains of the Moon]] and the people of Tsark that perhaps could be learned through diplomatic effort. It may prove difficult due to their inSular nature however. I cannot help but wonder what caused them to be closed off. This is of particular interest to me as the trail of Terunael refugees from Kaban leads through Axos and into The Mountains.

### THE [[Assistance]] OF OTHER ETERNALS

Beyond the use of Swim Leviathan's Depths and speaking with Ylenrith about Abraxus Stones there are other eternals we could seek information from.

**[[Llofir]]**

While the Empire turned its back on Llofir's offers of aid in favour of Fighting the eternal's presence in [[Reikos]] the eternal voiced its understanding that it cannot be both an ally and an enemy at the same time it could be one and then the other.

With some effort we could work to secure the information Llofir obtained while its heralds walked the trods and can discuss ways in which the eternal could aid us going forWard.

**[[Kaela]]**

Having voiced her dislike of The the Vallorn it is possible that we could seek aid and advice from the Eternal on how to end the Vallorn for good.

**[[Phaleron]]**

It is very difficult, but not impossible, to obtain documents from [[The Celestial Library]] and it is possible it has more books that are relevant to Terunael and The the Vallorn.

**[[Roshanwe]]**

The Eternal of discovery can be contacted through the [[Combing the Beach]] ritual and can provide Insights and other possible avenues of research on a topic. However the ritual only allows for 250 words to encompass what you already know so a good deal of thought would need to be put into the wording of the request.

### DIPLOMATIC OPTIONS

Terunael spread into lands beyond ours and as such there is information on the Vallorn and Terun civilisation outside our lands that could be procured through diplomatic effort.

**Axos**

We have already received a good deal of information through our dealings with the Axou and have some research from them outstanding. If these positive interactions continue then we should be able to share information with increased trust and freedom.

**The [[Thule]]**

An arguably more difficult route to undertake however we have already secured some information from The Thule in the form of the [[Ritual Text of The Arc of Skuld]]. The ritual details not only the people of Terunael and their actions but also what happened when a star fell upon the Vallorn. Should diplomatic relations continue on a good footing we could potentially learn more from the Dragons.

**[[Ossium]] and The [[Great Forest Orcs]]**

The only Vallorn heart we do not know the precise location of is that of Beantol Dol in [[The Mallum]]. While we can speculate on where it is we could get a better idea of the lay of the land from the people of the now [[Liberated]] Ossium, or perhaps from the Great Forest Orcs who have in the past offered to map the Mallum for the Empire.
