Spring 379YE

In this document I will try to answer some important questions and distinctions. What is the difference between a Vallorn and a Vallorn infestation? What is a Vallorn Miasma? What dwells in a Vallorn? How can we combat a Vallorn? How do Trods work? Hopefully this will allow someone reading it to gain a clearer idea of what [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] is and will stop misinformation. I am happy to update this document as needed and as more information comes to the light.

**What is the Vallorn?**

It is often easy to get confused by what the Vallorn is, mainly because we use the word to mean a variety of things. Put simply, the Vallorn is a geographical feature, the fallout from when the massive Tellurnial ritual was done. It is an area of land that corrupts and poisons all within it, causing the plants and beasts to mutate and attack all those who would venture into it. The dust and the pollen is mutated to form some sort of miasma that will Venom those who breath it in, or give those who live near it Greenlung.

The Vallorn is not a creature, it is not sentient and it does not have any linked intelligence between the creatures there. We assign personalities to the Vallorn based on how the creatures in their act, which may add to some of the confusion, however, the Vallorn itself is an area of corrupted Spring magic.

**What is a Vallorn Miasma?**

The Miasma is caused by the spring magic affecting the air and the effects of pollen and dust from the corrupted trees and plants. The miasma goes through the skin, so masks can be used to slow down the infection for a few minutes, but generally it will go through any part of revealed skin and effect the lungs.

Sometimes the miasma is visible as a green or yellow mist but too often it is hard to see at all. Sometimes the Vallorn Miasma can cause the same affects to a living creature as Venom, but more often it will cause Green Lung which is a fatal condition as the miasma attacks the lungs. It can be cured by drinking an infusion of Bladeroot but Spring magic such as the Blood of the Hydra would be needed to regrow and restore the lungs. It is likely that this needs to be done under surgery since the Vate would need to get to the exposed lungs. The Miasma will cause bodies to rot away and other items to decay strongly. We have found no magical way to get rid of the miasma, apart from in Miaren where destroying the Vallorn has stopped the miasma.

**What is a Vallorn Infestation?**

People sometimes try to take the corrupted plants from the Vallorn and regrow them to spread the Vallorn for their own vile purposes. I have no comprehension why people would wish to do this, however, they are often confused. What happens is that they are moving the corrupted plants and regrowing the corrupting plants. This may make more corrupted plants and this may create a Vallorn miasma from the dust. This does not create a new Vallorn that would take magics that as far as we are aware were above the majority of the Terunael civilisation.

Sometimes Vallornspawn will move to an area, this generally will not create a miasma, but they may be hungry or attracted there somehow. More often the winds will catch the miasma and Vallorn spawn will travel where the miasma

**What are Vallorn Spawn?**

Vallorn spawn is a generic name for the creatures that dwell in the Vallorn Miasma, as well as the creatures that are corrupted by the Vallorn. There is something intrinsically linked between these creatures as is shown by that the Winter Ritual, the Ward of the Black Waste will weakened all of these creatures.

The most common of these creatures is a Vallorn Husk. These creatures are husks of those who have died in a Vallorn Miasma that have been filled by the Vallorn corrupted plants. This is a highly painful process for someone who is terminal and the best thing to do is to execute them and preferably cast turn the circle. If you do not have a spring vate present, make sure that you dismember bodies to make sure that they cannot regrow. These creatures are passive when they do not sense any hostile presence and spend time in wet areas or in sunlight, seemingly to nourish the plants inside them. If they sense living creatures (or non-Vallorn touched creatures) they gain a sudden burst of spring energy. This energy means that they will move rapidly towards the living creature and attack it ferociously, trying to find a new host for their plants. Vallorn Husks can resist a lot of damage and the plants seem to regrow to bind together flesh whilst on the floor. The best way to deal with them is to decapitate them whilst they are on the ground, or more affectively by using Venom either by spell, oil of blackthorn or by using a Scorpion's Sting. IF the Husk is still terminal it can still be a foe, but retain the sentience of the creature. Do not be fooled, it is the husk in control and the best thing to do is to kill them and put them out of their suffering.

A Vallornspawn Hulk is a special type of Vallorn Husk that are created when an Ogre or other large creature is killed in a Miasma. These creatures act just like Vallorn Husks, but due to their large size they are must stronger and can resist the Venom. These creatures need to be taken down by Thorns and decapitated.

A Dryad is the name for a Vallornspawn Husk who has taken the body of a Briar. Due to the link to the link Briar's have with the Spring Realm they continue to grow bark after they have become Husks. These creatures seem to retain a heightened intelligence, or at least instinct, after their death and can channel their spring magic to heal other Husks. They are a dangerous foe and depending on their age can grow as large as a Vallornspawn Hulk. The larger, older Drayds are immune to venom due to their size, the younger, smaller ones can be killed just as easily.

The Ettercaps are the creatures that are the majority of the Vallorn. They normally dwell deep within the Vallorn Miasma and are found when venturing towards the heart of the Vallorn. The Ettercaps are generally bug like humanoids that seem to have some rudimentary sentience. Sometimes with claws and sometimes with weapons these creatures travel in packs and will try to overwhelm their opponents.

Some of the more intelligent Ettercaps will use magics although these are extremely rare. Generally the Ettercaps will use natural venoms and herbs to support themselves in combat. Often they will use Husks to attack and then strike on force to a single point, They are sometimes accompanied by Dire Spiders. These massive creatures can devastate a small unit and seem resilient to most weapons, striking with a venomous bite and spitting venom over small areas.

**How do you combat a Vallorn?**

The build up of Vallorn energies needs to be removed before you can destroy the Vallorn completely. Navarr and Thorn performed a great ritual that created the Trod Network. When the Trods have dispersed enough energy from a Vallorn, the miasma is weakened enough that armies can fight against the Vallorn Spawn that dwell in that area. It is also possible to use Winter Magics to counter the Vallorn Spawn in an area by casting Wither the Seed, this will not harm the Vallorn but it will cut down the Vallorn Spawn and mean that the territory is easier to take.

Attacking a Vallorn when it still is at full energy would be suicide. The current amount of Trods will keep the Vallorn from spreading, if we start losing territories then this may allow the Vallorn to spread again and we need to make sure that we do not lose to the Barbarians. To defeat the Vallorn we need to wait hundreds more years or to expand the trod network. I surmise that at the point that the Trod Network is the same size as the original Terunael Empire then we shall have enough strength to combat all the Vallorn within our lifetime.

**What actually are the Trods?**

The Trods are what our way of life is based upon. Stridings walk the Trods to make sure that the energy is dispersed, Steadings guard the Trods and make sure that they can provide for the Stridings who are performing the ritual.

Walking a trod is part of a great ritual, the Spring Magic from the Vallorn is imparted into those walking it and although this gives them great energy so they can walk for further, the major part of the ritual is to disperse the energy.

As an analogy, the Vallorn would be lakes of corrupted spring energy and the Trods are irrigation channels that drain the energy away. Walking the trods produces the current that will drain the energy.

For those Navarr who distrust Spring magic, they need to remember that performing a Spring Ritual is what makes us Navarr. This is what our way of life is. They need to trust the Spring Vates about what is a good use of this power and what is now.

All Imperial Territories have working Trods in them, although the lost Territories of Liathaven, Spiral and The Mournwold have had their Trods eroded due to lack of walking them fully. Although these Trods can be remade with the Dance of Navarr and Thorn, we need to aid in the taking of these areas to allow the ritual to be cast.

Broc√©liande is where the Dance of Navarr and Thorn was first performed. Although it is not in Imperial Territory, the Navarr here walk through the Vallorn. It is interesting to note that it is not the fact that the territory is not imperial controlled that stops the Navarr walking it, it is the fact that Barbarians stop the Navarr walking it. There are Steadings in the vallorn territories in all the Navarr territories and Stridings regularly walk those Trods.

In 75YE and 245YE Trods were created in the Barrens. It was confirmed by some of the Orcs from the Barrens that the Great Forest of Peytah was not happy with the creation of Trods in that area. Whether the Barrens Orcs themselves damage them or whether the Great Forest has some supernatural way of combatting the Trods it is still unknown. The Barrens Orcs said that the Great Forest could be placated, so the Trods could still be build there.

Trods cannot be created over water, and although some cross rivers that can be forded it is not possible to create Trods over Seas or even large lakes.

**How Many Vallorn Are there?**

Each of the Vallorn Hearts are around one of the old Terunael Cities. There are four Vallorn Hearts in the Empire and Three Outside it. One of these is in Skuld in Oktadov, it is likely to spread around the regions of Hahlerm, K√≥gur and Stathas. It would be interesting to find out how the Thule have kept this at bay since there is no Trod Network in Oktodov.

There are also two others to the East, although their locations are unknown. By looking at a map of Terunael it might be possible find the locations of these cities and find out their names.

**Why does the Vallorn Exist?**

Magic doesn't have side effects, when you have an arcane projection you are aware of the outcome of the ritual. The Vallorn was deliberately created over the major Terunael Cities. The question is why? It was obviously created as a weapon against the Orcs, but it didn't work. The followers of Navarr were still in the Forests, The Urizens, the Suaq, the Kallavesi, the Feni and the Ushkans also in hiding from the Orcs. The Orcs were not defeated, but the Empire was destroyed. The only thing the Vallorn has done is guard their ruins.
