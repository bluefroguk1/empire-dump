In the wake of the Grey [[Pilgrimage]] joining the Stridings of [[Navarr]] I have consulted the previous documents and my Guides to create [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] routes that follow the [[Trods|trods]]. Specifically, they follow the paths the exemplars [[Navarr]] ([[Wisdom]]) and [[Thorn]] ([[Ambition]]) took in re-establishing the Trods in their new purpose of draining the [[Spring magic]] of [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]].

**THE GREAT CHOREOGRAPHY - THE INTRODUCTION**

[[Navarr]] and [[Thorn]] began their journey in [[Miaren]], the [[Territory|territory]] that would see the defeat of the first [[Vallorn]] heart. Today it is a safe and defensible territory in the heart of [[The Empire|the Empire]]. Whilst here there are a few sites [[Worth|worth]] visiting;

The first is Rhonwen's Fall where the first Binding of Thorns was sworn and a nation was founded. In less peaceable times, when the [[Navarr]] spent more time hiding from [[Barbarians|barbarians]] than hunting them, it was a refuge named [[Sanctuary]] Falls. It was renamed in 30YE in honour of the [[Archmage|archmage]] Rhonwen who gave her life to help defeat [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]] of [[Miaren]]. The [[Steading|steading]] is built into the cliff under falls that feed the upper reaches of the Gancio. The settlement attracts scholars from across [[The Empire|the Empire]] who wish to study the swirling intricate designs that the first [[Navarr]] carved into the rocks here, designs that contain information about trods and old [[Ritual|ritual]] dances.

Second is The Pool of Silver Clouds, many tales tell of Navarr herself visiting these waters. Nestled in the southern foothills of the Locul peaks it is a still pool in a quiet glade which, whatever the weather, reflects silver clouds and a blue sky. It is said that some vates can divine the future in the waters of the pool.

And finally, Serenael. The ruins of the Terunael city of Seren lie in northern Serenael; this is where the dark heart of the [[Miaren]] [[Vallorn|vallorn]] lay. The [[Golden Trees of Seren]] is a sprawling [[Weirwood|weirwood]] [[Forest|forest]] that covers much of northern Serenael and encompasses roughly a third of the Terunael ruins. The rest of the ruins are given over to the largest permanent Navarr settlement - the city of Seren.

The ruins of Seren have been extensively explored and catalogued, and many of the facts [[The Empire|the Empire]] knows about the Terunael were uncovered here. At the height of Terunael, Seren was a city known for its scholars and poets, and for both colleges and military academies. Several of these buildings were reclaimed when [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]] fell, and while no writing survived exposure to the heart of corruption, a combination of divination [[Magic|magic]] and tireless archaeology slowly teased out some of the secrets of the Terunael.

From here Navarr, [[Thorn]] and their compatriots travelled to [[Astolat]]. As you follow in their footsteps it is [[Worth|worth]] considering visiting Boar's Hollow. A great statue of a boar, fully 20 hands high, moss covered and inscribed with writings of Terunael, stands here in a small hollow, apparently watching the border with [[Varushka]]. Some amongst the Dawnish regard it as a place of fertility. Whilst this location is a mystery at present seeing artifacts of a time before the [[Vallorn]] gives a lot to ponder on.

Next Broceliande, arguably the most difficult leg of the [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] as [[The Vallorn|the vallorn]] here is most widespread but that makes it all the more important that the trods are walked here. Aid can be found in Eleri's Stead or by entering the territory through [[Semmerholm]] and into Boar's Dell.

From there it's into [[Reikos]] and perhaps to High Chalcis, a [[Great work|great work]] going from strength to strength and home to apothecaries and healers. It is also a testament to the friendship between Navarr and [[Highguard]] with neighbouring [[Therunin]] helping support the Highborn of the mount when needed.

Speaking of [[Therunin]], that is the territory Navarr and [[Thorn]] extended the trods into next. From Chalcis Mount it is a short journey to Peakedge Song. One of the most important sites in the territory, Peakedge Stead is found in the western part of the territory. A place of contemplation, of houses in the trees where the Navarr can see across the hills of [[Reikos]] to the forests beyond. Some stories claim the [[Steading|steading]] is a remnant of long-lost Terunael; there is something ageless about the trees here.

The Upper Tarn Valley is [[Worth|worth]] consideration including in the [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] route. The largest [[Steading|steading]] in the area is Return, a well-fortified settlement surrounded by tall watch towers that look out across the forests to the north and east. A place of flowers and memory, the [[Steading|steading]] has a storied [[History|history]], revolving around the tale of a [[Brand]] who spent too much time amongst the barbarians and became too much like them - where Stridings pass to remember what happens when you forget that you are human, and they are not. It is also the place where the extent of Yaw'nagrah's meddling with the [[Vallorn]] in recent years was discovered.

From [[Therunin]] Navarr and [[Thorn]] made their way back home, travelling first back through [[Reikos]] and into [[Casinea]] before coming back to [[Miaren]]. Whilst passing through [[Casinea]] it is [[Worth|worth]] stopping in [[Anvil]], for it's through the founding and expansion of [[The Empire|the Empire]] and cooperation of [[The Nations|the Nations]] that the trods were able to be spread.

**THE GREAT CHOREOGRAPHY - THE FIRST VERSE**

Having already spent somewhere between 20 and 30 years on the first part of their Great Journey, Navarr, Thorn and their [[Coven|coven]](s) set out once more. This was a quicker undertaking but not without its troubles.

They made their way to [[Liathaven]], travelling through [[Upwold]], [[Mitwold]], [[Mournwold]] and [[Bregasland]]. The Eastern Guard in [[Upwold]] is [[Worth|worth]] travelling through. Great crenelated walls and brooding towers look down from Eastern Guard onto the northern [[Forest|forest]] of [[Miaren]]. Built early in the history of [[The Marches|the Marches]] in Birchland, the garrison was initially charged both with remaining vigilant against Dawnish aggression, and with maintaining readiness for attacks from the Vallornspawn of the deep woods.

Since Miaren was cleansed in the early days of [[The Empire|the Empire]], and since the people of [[Dawn]] are now an allied nation, the castle has become more open - it is a popular stopping place for merchants travelling through the central Empire. Still, the dour Marchers ensure it maintains battle readiness at all times, for one never knows when an attack may come from an unexpected direction.

At the time of writing this it may be difficult to spend time in parts of [[Liathaven]] given the presence of the [[Jotun]]. However, when the territory is more secure or if the pilgrims are careful and well prepared there are several sites of interest in the territory.

Liaven's Glen is of particular note. This area of eastern [[Liathaven]] was the first area of [[Liathaven]] freed of [[Vallorn]] influence some two hundred years before the foundation of the Empire. Woven between the trees of Liaven's Glen is The Dance; a network of earthen trails marked in the grass and the trees, several miles wide, worn into the ground with the footfall of centuries. The Navarr say that it is a symbol for the Great Dance writ large on the earth. Some from [[Urizen]] believe that dancing Liaven's Dance could grant humans a greater understanding the path of the soul through the Labyrinth of Ages.

The [[Steading|steading]] of Liaven's Dance was ancient, dating back to the earliest days after [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] emerged. It was a regular place of [[Pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Navarr practitioners of [[The Way|the Way]], and a centre for philosophical thought combining the philosophy of the Great Dance with the Virtues. The fact that it is now in the hands of the [[Jotun]] barbarians marks a terrible loss for the Navarr and perhaps the Empire. Several other [[Steadings|steadings]] here were home to experienced covens of vates who oversaw potent mana sites and studied the vallorn along the edges of Liath's Heart to the south-west.

Of particular note is [[The Library|the library]] at Turning [[Spiral]]. This old steading held a repository of Navarr magical lore that survived the purges of [[Emperor Nicovar]] comparatively unscathed. Tragically, its own defenders were forced to destroy it rather than let it fall into [[Barbarian|barbarian]] hands.

The Paths of Lan Thúven are also in the territory. In Western Scout,stand the crumbling pillars of an old gateway. The [[Gate]] of Lan Thúven dates back to pre-Imperial times; it may even be Terunael in origin. No stories remain to say who, or what, or where Lan Thúven might have been. Only the gate remains - this one, and a second gate in West Ranging on the far side of [[Liathaven]]. At one time a path between these gates, a hidden way woven with [[Night magic]], allowed the Navarr to travel through the Vallorn unscathed. In pushing back the Vallorn presence here the paths have lost their [[Magic|magic]] but the gates remain places of interest.

**THE GREAT CHOREOGRAPHY - THE REFRAIN**

From Liathaven Navarr and Thorn spread their influence, and the trods, to the north. Unfortunately, we currently don't have records of this part of their journey and can only speculate the route they took. I [[Will|will]] update this part of the pilgrimage if new information comes to light.

However it stands to reason they travelled to the next Vallorn heart, [[Hercynia]]. The direct [[Trod|trod]] route to there is through [[Bregasland]] once more and on to [[Kallavesa]].

Whilst it does not relate to the Vallorn or the battle against it there is another route to follow in the territory - The Pilgrims Trail, a journey of virtue worth consideration while passing through the territory or as another pilgrimage to undertake after completing The Great Choreography.

From [[Kallavesa]] the trods go through [[Hahnmark]] and into [[Hercynia]]. The northen Navarri territory has a few places of significance to welcome pilgrims at the end of their journey.

[[The Blade]] of Thorn an intricate knot of paths in the slopes of Old Ranging, [[The Blade|the Blade]] of Thorn is shaped by the winding of small rods and banks of heather. Built at the request of Rhisiart Dancewalker it is a site of memorial and [[Pride|pride]] to those who have given their lives in support of the Empire and whose unnumbered names are carved into stone menhirs that periodically line the earthen slopes. Visitors to the site are encouraged to chisel the names of fallen [[Heroes|heroes]] to the stones by [[The Blade|the Blade]]'s rest [[Wayhouse|wayhouse]], used as a hostel by those who maintain the work.

Also, Summersend hosts a number of Terunael ruins. One noteworthy example is The Gate of [[Summer]]. Two huge stones and a top lintel stand in the middle of a clearing, carved about with boar, deer and other game, and symbols representing summer. It is covered in moss, and no-one has ever seen a hint of any [[Magic|magic]] from it.

There are also several other well-explored Terunael ruins. Many steadings are built on a foundation of old Terunael structures, and it is from here that the push to [[Drive back|drive back]] the Vallorn is overseen.

There are several old battlefields here, most dating back to pre-Imperial times and to attempts by the Vard ancestors of the Varushkans to conquer [[Hercynia]].

Most of these battlefields have long since been forgotten but one,- Mourning Hollow on the very south-eastern borders. It is now the site of the Great Library of Hacynian, overseen by the [[Advisor on the Vallorn]] [[The Library|the library]] is a central repository of lore surrounding Terunael, its fall and the phenomena of the Vallorn. It has been constructed as much as possible in the style of the old ruins, incorporating their original stone wherever possible. The structure is not especially large, but it is exceptionally beautiful, filled with shelves of scrolls and parchments written by students of [[Navarr History|Navarr history]]. It also incorporates a small shrine dedicated to the virtue of [[Wisdom]].
