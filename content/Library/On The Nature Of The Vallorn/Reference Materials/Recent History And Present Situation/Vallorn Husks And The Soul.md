Here we further discuss information obtained about [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] and how it may interact and indeed imperil the soul.

**The Husks Of Return**

Whilst the [[Heroes|heroes]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]] were fighting against the [[Vallorn]] at the [[Steading]] of Return in 380YE we were hard pressed to survive the onslaught of the husks that would gather and attack the [[Steading]] regularly once our presence was noted. It was at this time that a Herald of the [[Eternal]] [[Meraud]] approached the Steading asking to speak to Ceinwen to provide a boon. This boon was a statute of old appearance that had a [[Magic|magic]] to it. Ceinwen was told it would allow a [[Mage|mage]] to be able to cast the spell Speak with Dead on a [[Vallorn]] husk (ordinarily the spell would have no effect on vallornspawn).

After casting [[Day magic]] to determine that this was indeed the use of this strange item Ceinwen used it when next the husks attacked. The gathered [[Heroes|heroes]] of [[The Empire|the Empire]] kept a number of husks on the floor by repeatedly cutting them down whilst Ceinwen cast her [[Magic|magic]]. The first time this produced endless screaming until the husk was put down with [[Venom|venom]]. However, on other attempts with different husks a variety of responses were discovered. Some seemed to have flashes of memory of who they were and their time as a husk. At least one horrified soul said that they could remember it all. all their time as a puppet of [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]].

It seemed from these interviews that these were people who had no control of their actions but at times could recollect bits of their previous life. They were trapped against their [[Will|will]].

**A Discussion With [[Kaela]] - Bledri [[Eternal]]**

I was fortunate enough to be given an audience with the Eternal [[Kaela]] the Lady of the Grim Host, Queen of Silence. This was in the Year 381 YE. This audience was attended by a number of [[Navarr]] Vates including Sian Eternal and Griff Umbral Path along with some others I did not know. I was given leave to ask a question of Kaela. Due to interactions with the Vallorn and attempts to talk to Vallorn Husks the previous year at the Steading of Return I thought that the best question I could ask would be one directly tied to her concern of the ending of things. Kaela exemplifies [[Weakness|weakness]], despair, old-age, senility and desperation. She takes no joy in these things, but presents them as simple, unquestionable facts. Everything fails. Everything dies. Everything falls apart.

In the end, entropy wins. I therefore asked her "Do those that fall to the Vallorn reach their true end?" In response I was told that "They do not. They are trapped."

This was a response I expected and whilst there was nothing to compel the Eternal to answer my question truthfully, I could not think of any good reason as to why they would not.

After discussion with some Guides we thought it best to try and test this when we could and therefore resolved when next we could to ask a [[Guide]] to try and use the ceremony of [[Insight]] on a Husk to see if they were undead or a creature of the [[Realms]] or if as might be possible a person who's soul was trapped.

**On Insighting A Husk**

What follows is an account by Raewyn Eternal, Guide of [[Loyalty]] when questioned on her experience using the rite of [[Insight]] upon a [[Vallornspawn husk|vallornspawn husk]].

"A large contingent of mostly [[Navarr]] went on a skirmish to [[Liathaven]] as the mission was to hold an area while a [[Ritual|ritual]] was conducted. I went with the battle-ready members of my [[Striding|striding]] with the secondary mission to capture a [[Vallornspawn husk|vallornspawn husk]] and perform an Insight upon it. We had to await an [[Opportunity|opportunity]] to lure a couple of husks away from the main horde and drag it behind our fighters where it was subdued and I was able to perform an Insight upon it. The insight the ceremony afforded me told me that I was looking at an orc, not an "other', not a creature of the realms, but an orc, who judging by the tattered remains of their clothing, was formally of the [[Jotun]]. No lives were lost in the secondary mission, and it was conducted with the knowledge and support of the skirmish leader. The husk I insighted was then put to rest by envenoming"

Raewyn was not the only priest present in her mission, she had the support of Brat Umbral Path.

"He offered to do the ceremony in my stead as a more experienced fighter" she recalled "but I had to see it for myself. He oversaw and assisted with corralling the husk and watched as I performed the ceremony"

When asked how the Insight made her feel she replied

"Incredibly sad, I did not want it to be true, but knowing that this person in front of me was being denied their chance to cross the Howling Abyss and that such a terrible fate had befallen thousands of others is both heartbreaking and a source of strength and determination to see them set free."

**Further Insights**

Following Raewyn's [[Synod]] [[Judgement]] detailing her Insight and what it meant being presented to the Empire more investigation was conducted by priests across the Empire and beyond.

I feel it is important to note what the Ceremony of Insight does, through the power of this ceremony, a priest can perceive the [[Aura|aura]] that surrounds living people, and gather information about spiritual effects.

If the [[Aura|aura]] around an individual is not concealed then the priest [[Will|will]] learn if they are; human, orc, creature of the realms (including heralds), ghost or 'other'

What Raewyn saw in her insight was an orc soul, just as you would when performing the ceremony upon a living orc. In further investigations different results have been found which has caused increased concern.

In addition to the insight of "human' or 'orc' being documented some priests have seen the spiritual aura known as "other'.

One notable example of this was a former Imperial citizen who joined the [[Sumaah Republic]] who travelled to [[Anvil]] to learn more of the greatest spiritual threat to the Empire. After some discussion he travelled through the [[Sentinel Gate]] on a skirmish with the people of Navarr and was able to use the Ceremony of Insight upon a vallornspawn husk. He was distressed by what he saw, given that it wasn't human, orc, ghost or of the realms. As Raewyn recalled following the skirmish debrief:

"They were shocked and alarmed by what they saw in the insight. They did this in an area known to have suffered the interference of Yaw'nagrah who has been actively changing vallornspawn from their usual forms. It is greatly hoped that if this the case and her interference has changed the nature of those husks that the process has released the soul and allowed it to pass on unharmed"

Further investigation and discussion is required on this matter but what is known is that souls can be seen within husks and that the insight of 'other' is one that we hope is a sign that a soul has been released and that it is not a sign of corruption to the soul within the husk.
