[[The Vallorn]] today is a very real and present threat to all of [[The Empire]], it is not only a danger to our lands but to the souls of our citizens.

A [[Vallorn]] is a geographical feature, an area of land with particular traits. These traits stem from a strong affiliation to the Spring [[Realm]] with previous vate-scholars naming it a 'super [[Regio]] of sorts. Within the Vallom is a miasma made of spores and dust, this miasma twists creatures and plants within the area making them increasingly dangerous; bigger, deadlier, more Venomous.

Larger corrupted creatures within a Vallom miasma are known as vallomspawn. Vallorspawn not only include the corruption of living creatures but also the bodies of those who have fallen in battle in the area. If an individual takes a grievous amount of daMage that would render them terminal and is not removed from the area then the [[Spring magic]] will hold them there, on the brink of death, their bodies puppeted by plantlife that will grow through them. Their soul will be trapped, unable to enter the Labyrinth or attempt to cross the Great Abyss.

There are seven active Vallorn sites in the Empire and beyond its borders. Those within or near our lands are in [[Hercynia]], [[Therunin]], [[Liathaven]] and [[Broc√©liande]]. Those in foreign and Barbarian lands are in [[Otkodov]], [[The Mallum]] and [[Axos]]. There was once a Vallorn within [[Miaren]], which through a variety of factors (including a casting of "[[Wither the Seed]]' upon the well populated and defensible territory) was defeated, [[Navarr]]'s greatest victory to date.

**The Vallorn Miasma**
Miasma within The the Vallorn is caused by Spring [[Magic]] affecting the air and the
Miasma of pollen and dust from the corrupted trees and plants. Sometimes the
effects Visible as a green or yellow mist but more often it is hard to see at
miasma Usually the Vallorn Miasma can cause the same effects to a living creature
all. [[Venom]] and often it will cause Green Lung which is a fatal condition as the miasma attacks the lungs.

**Vallornspawn**
The most common Vallornspawn are husks. These creatures are what remains have
The those who have fallen with a grievous wound in a Vallorn Miasma that
of filled by The the Vallorn corrupted plants. These creatures are passive when
been do not sense any hostile presence and spend time in wet areas or in
they sunlight, seemingly to nourish the plants inside them. If they sense living
creatures (or non-Vallorn touched creatures) they gain a sudden burst of spring
This energy means that they will move rapidly toWards the living
creature energy. and attack it ferociously, trying to find a new host for their
plants. Vallorn husks can resist a lot of damage and the plants seem to regrow
to bind together flesh whilst on the floor.

A Vallornspawn Hulk is a special type of Vallorn Husk that are created when
an [[Ogre]] or other large creature is killed in a Miasma. These creatures act just
like Vallorn Husks, but due to their large size they are much stronger and can
resist the Venom.

A Dryad is the name for a [[Vallornspawn husk]] who has taken the body of a [[Briar]]. Due to the link Briars have with the Spring Realm they continue to grow bark after
they have become husks. These creatures seem to retain a heightened intelligence, or at least instinct, after they fall and can channel their Spring magic to [[Heal]] other Husks. They are a dangerous foe and depending on their age can grow as large as a Vallornspawn Hulk, becoming what many refer to as an Ent.

The Ettercaps are the creatures that are the majority of the Vallorn. They normally dwell deep within the Vallorn Miasma and are found when venturing towards the heart of The Vallorn. The Ettercaps are Generally bug like humanoids that seem to have some rudimentary sentience. Sometimes with claws and sometimes with weapons these creatures travel in packs and will try to overwhelm their
opponents. Some of the more intelligent Ettercaps will use magics although
these are extremely rare. Generally the Ettercaps will use natural venoms and
herbs to support themselves in combat. Often they will use Husks to attack
and then strike on force to a single point, They are sometimes accompanied by
Dire Spiders.

In more recent seasons there have been reports of more intelligent Ettercaps
using better weaponry and tactics. This development is most likely due to the
influence of the Spring [[Eternal]] known as Yaw'nagrah.

**Cultists Within The Vallorn**
Over the years there have been reports of cultists meddling with The Vallorn,
trying to rouse the spawn within. In recent years these groups have become
more active. The most proMinent group being the Heirs of Terunael, who with
the help of the Green Mother, Yaw' 'nagrah have successfUlly stirred the
Vallorn in both Liathaven and Broceliande. More worrying is that likeminded
groups, such as the "Cabal of the Green Mother" of [[Varushka]], seem to be working alongside them with the intent of Empowering all Vallorn sites and the creatures within.

**The Trods**
Stridings walk the trods to make sure that the Spring energy at the heart of the
Vallorn is dispersed, Steadings guard the trods and make sure that they can
provide for the Stridings who are performing the ritual. Walking a [[Trod]] is part
of a great ritual, the Spring Magic from the Vallorn is imparted into those
walking it and although this gives them great energy so they can walk for
longer and further, the major part of the ritual is to disperse the energy. As an
analogy, the Vallorn would be lakes of corrupted Spring energy and the trods
are irrigation channels that drain the energy away. Walking the trods produces
the current that will drain the energy.

If a trod is not walked by a significant number then their power fades and the
paths erode. Although these Trods can be remade with the Dance of Navarr
and [[Thorn]], areas without the ability to maintain steadings to oversee them they
will erode again and it will be unlikely safe enough to allow the ritual Dance
of Navarr and Thorn to be cast.

**The Grey Pilgrims**
It is in the [[Hearth magic]] of Navarr that the ritual of the trods is most effective. The oaths of intent to defeat the Vallorn and traced patterns of the land help strengthen
the dispersal of Spring magic. In the wake of the widespread news that the Vallorn traps souls the people of [[Highguard]] joined the journey on the trods in
significant numbers.

Spurred on by a [[Mandate]] passed with greater majority through the Highborn National [[Assembly]] in Summer 382 YE the travellers, named the Grey Pilgrims set out.
They walk with their own power and purpose, that of virtuous [[Pilgrimage]], to disperse the corrupting Spring magic.
