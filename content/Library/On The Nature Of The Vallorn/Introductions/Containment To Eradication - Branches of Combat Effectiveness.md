As we know from the discussion had by [[Navarr]] and [[Thorn]] (see [[Chapter]] Three:
The First Plans to [[Fight]] Back) to defeat [[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] threat for good our best
course of action is to join all of the [[Vallorn]] sites with the [[Trod|trod]] network and then
strike at them with armies. Of course this is a long term plan that we should be
ever aiming towards and in the meantime there are several ways to keep the
dangers at bay and protect ourselves.

The first is the maintenance of the [[Trods|trods]], keeping the territories they walk
through safe and overseen so the Navarri stridings and Grey Pilgrims can walk
these paths quickly and freely. This also involves the securing of old territories
to extend the network. [[Liathaven]] is a prime example of this, while the trods
can be repaired without local stridings to walk them and more importantly the
[[Steadings|steadings]] to watch them there [[Will|will]] be the ever looming threat of expansion of
[[The Vallorn|the Vallorn]] there. We may have push back the [[Vallorn]] there but without people
in the [[Territory|territory]] the trods [[Will|will]] fray once more.

Another avenue to explore in defeating the Vallorn is the aid of Eternals. It has
been proven that a boon from [[Surut]] can be especially effective against
vallornspawn (and any other nearby vegetation) and [[Llofir]] has previously
offered his [[Assistance|assistance]] (though he was placed under Enmity before this could
be investigated further) The [[Winter]] [[Eternal]], [[Kaela]], has also voiced dislike of
the existence of the Vallorn as it has no end. In opposition to this is the hand
of Yaw'nagrah - she has repeatedly tampered with the Vallorn, creating new
and deadlier vallornspawn.

While these paths are of a grander scale there are also precautions that many
can take if they are to enter an area of Vallorn or plan to aid people who have
travelled through one.

**The Miasma**
The illness wrought by the Vallorn will pass through your skin and so there is
no way outside of [[Magic|magic]] to fully protect yourself from its effects. This miasma
will seep through mouth and nose protection and so covering your face will
not stop the infection. However it may make breathing easier and also stop
spores entering your lungs directly, potentially slowing infection, which is why
the [[Navarr]] take the field often with mouth coverings. Given time the miasma
will seep in and envenom you anyway. You will need to be prepared. Make sure that you have anti-venoms to remove the effects where you can but in the
miasma they will return. If possible do not engage within the miasma.

Once you have left an area of Vallorn infestation get yourself checked by a
physik for Green Lung, it is a fatal condition as the miasma attacks the lungs. It
can be cured by drinking an infusion of [[Bladeroot]] but in advanced cases [[Spring]]
[[Magic|magic]] such as the [[Blood of the Hydra]] would be needed to regrow and restore
the lungs. It is likely that this needs to be done under surgery since the [[Vate]]
would need to get to the exposed lungs.

The [[Day ritual]] Aesthetic Star of [[Atun]] can also aid in removing some infections
gained from the Vallorn, especially those that manifest in a similar way to
venoms.

**Fighting Vallornspawn**
Vallorn husks are resilient, the plant life that puppets them regenerating
quickly so even if a husk is chopped down they will get back up. The main way to [[Combat|combat]] this effect is to use venomous attacks through blade venoms, magic weapons or battle magic. For the average husk hitting them only once in such a manner will be enough to see them defeated for good.

Dryads also need to be envenomed to disable their ability to regenerate but
they will also need to be cut down, their bodies being hardier than average husks.

Larger must be vallornspawn such as hulks and ents are often resistant to
[[Venom|venom]] and must be defeated in battle and their bodies quickly decapitated (and preferably dismembered) to avoid them getting back up. This approach works preferably on husks and  dryads as well, however [[Venom|venom]] is far more efficient.

Ettercaps and do not are to be approached with caution as they hold rudimentary sentience and do not attack as mindlessly as other vallornspawn. They are also known have to regenerative capabilities which need to be overcome.

## Aiding Your Allies
Before venturing into a miasma you and your allies should be prepared. You should always be equipped with ways to deal and resist venoms and there are ways to resist the vallorn's taint that should be considered, especially for any  briars that enter a Vallorn. Always watch each other's backs and take not of wounds sustained by allies to ensure they are healed swiftly.

Should the worst happen and one of you fall then the body must be retrieved for the sake of their soul. If you cannot get the body away from the area the [[Spring ritual]] [[Turns The Circle|Turns the Circle]] should be performed to return their body to the earth. If no Spring ritualist is available the grisly task of dismembering the body as you would a felled husk is necessary to try to ensure they do not rise again.

**Items That Aid in the [[Fight]]**

There are several items that are of use in the fight against the Vallorn that people should familiarise themselves with to aid in their battle preparations:

*[[Imperial Roseweald]]* - This [[Herb|herb]] allows a trained physic to remove the effects of venoms. This is of obvious use in removing the effects of a Vallorn miasma. However, within a miasma you will suffer re-infection.

*[[Bloodharrow Philtre]]* - This is an [[Apothecary|apothecary]] [[Potion|potion]] that you can drink that will have the same effects as [[Imperial Roseweald]] administered by a physic. This is a very useful [[Potion|potion]] to carry with you. This can be recognised as follows - This translucent red liquid has tiny white particles suspended in it. It has a spicy scent, and a tiny amount on your tongue or your finger tingles unpleasantly for a moment.

*Maledict's Medicament* - This is an apothecary potion that you can drink that removes the effects of venoms mundane and magical as well as effects that will weaken you. It is a deep crimson liquid has a thin layer of scummy froth atop it. It smells unpleasant and has an oily texture. A drop on your tongue makes you salivate - it is vile and you will feel a strong urge to spit the mixture out.

*[[The Sovereign]] Specific* - This is a wonderful potion that cures all ill effects
and as such if you have been injured and envenomed can save your life. It's a
clear liquid that seems almost to sparkle when it is shaken or held up to the
light. It smells fresh and a little minty. A drop on your tongue will reveal it to
have a vibrant, pleasant taste.

*[[Oil of Blackthorn]]* - This oil is a blade venom which you can coat a weapon
with. This will allow you to strike down a Vallorn Husk. Note that this dries
quickly on [[The Blade|the blade]] and will only stay effective for 10 seconds.

*[[Abraxus Stone]]* - This item has the sole purpose of protection against the
Vallorn. When you are healed in any way venom is purged from your body.
Additionally, the item makes you immune to the effects of the Vallorn miasma.
You can't catch Green Lung and should you fall to the Vallorn you will not rise
as a Husk.

*Scorpion's Stings & [[Barbed Spear]]* - These weapons allow those without
magic to envenom their enemies.

*[[Singing Stones]]* - While the people of Navarr have only discovered one of these
stones its ability to bind multiple covens together to cast anti-Vallorn [[Rituals|rituals]] is
priceless.

**[[Rituals]] of Use in Fighting the Vallorn**
The ritualists of [[The Empire|the Empire]] have a few rituals at their disposal for fighting the Vallorn and this number will hopefully grow given all we are learning of this vile threat.

*[[Ascetic Star of Atun]]* - This [[Day]] [[Ritual|ritual]] allows a [[Magician|magician]] to cure venom from potentially a large number of people.

*[[Ward of the Black Waste]]* - This [[Winter ritual]] allows you to ward an area against the Vallorn. Any such creature of any size will be weakened within the ward allowing you to cut them down without them getting back up.

*The Grave's Treacherous Edge *- This Winter ritual allows a magician envenom all creatures within a large area. Of great use in destroying Vallorn to Spawn.

*[[Fetid Breath of Teeming Plague]]* - This Spring ritual does the same as above Winter Ritual.

*[[Vitality of Rushing Water]]* - This Spring ritual gives its recipient the same protection as an [[Abraxus]] Stone.

*[[Turns The Circle|Turns the Circle]] *- This Spring ritual rapidly decomposes a corpse. This will stop it from being raised as a Vallorn Husk.

*[[The Dance of Navarr and Thorn]]* - The creation of more trods is vital to leeching the [[Spring magic]] from the hearts of the Vallorn. We must all endeavour to walk the trods, it fights a great threat but also invigorates any who walk those paths allowing them to walk longer distances in a shorter time.

*[[Wither the Seed|Wither The Seed]] and The Arc of Skuld* - While placing Winter curses on a territory is highly inadvisable the nature of Winter will slow the progress of the overwhelming [[Spring magic]] that is the Vallorn. [[Wither the Seed|Wither The Seed]] and the [[Thule]] ritual Arc of Skuld are two means to this end but should be only used in the direst of circumstances.

There is currently no codified way to reverse the effects of Wither The Seed but the people of Navarr are currently working on solutions, especially to [[Combat|combat]] the blight placed on Broceliande.
