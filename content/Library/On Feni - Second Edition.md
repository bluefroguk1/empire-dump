**A Treatise On The [[Feni]] Peoples And Their Recent Dealings With This Empire**
 By Watt Lambrook, Imperial Adviser For The Feni
 
 # Introduction
 
 The first thing to understand is that The Feni are themselves not a single people like  the [[Thule]] or [[Jotun]]. Despite some cultural similarities, each [[Tribe]] of these humans  varies in culture, faith, and attitude and this makes them as likely to [[Fight]] each other  as any Imperial force or Orc tribe. They are as old as the Terunael, perhaps older. This  creates great differences between them, their shared histories and [[Bad blood]] bind  them and their descendants to this day as you will learn. They are a people who  suffered great cruelties as chattel slaves to the Magician Princes of Terun, and later  the forebears of The Jotun and Lasambrians orcs. One that has made them more  willing to die free and wild than under any foreign yoke.
 
 This work detailed newer discoveries based on events in the year of 382YE with the  three known Feni groups [[The Empire]] has interacted with politically. Two from  [[Upwold]], one in The [[Mournwold]]. Since then, there have been more developments  both in interactions with Feni tribes as well as further discoveries thanks to the work  of myself and the Department of [[Historical research]]. Much of the history can be  accessed elsewhere however I will be sharing theories from colleagues in [[Anvil]] about  parts of that history which remain less clear. I will also be writing on further updates
 on each of the tribes listed in their interactions with the Empire. Including the  recently formed and faltering “Confederation of Hotters Mire”. I will be aiming to  keep most of my language the same for posterity but I will be altering the text to  better reflect our improved understanding of such events.
 
 The other thing I would also like you, dear reader to know is I hardly expect you to  read this whole thing from start to finish. This a compiled piece of knowledge, a  guide of recent history and revelations on the subject matter. This is no storybook or  saga. It is a collection of works. Read at your own speed.
 
 # Common Interactions
 
 As commonly known, Feni tribes regularly stage raids around Western parts of the  Empire. [[The Marches]], southern [[Wintermark]] and the northern Brass Coast are their  usual targets. The tribes raid for [[Basic]] resources such as food, herbs and other  essentials. They have no use for gold or other fine things as [[Currency]] and wealth as  we know it do not exist within their societies. No known tribes appear to have  knowledge of agriculture or basic metal work at present.
 
 Although their intention is simple scavenging, Virtue calls many Imperials to fight to  protect what is theirs, as be the right of any Citizen and with this blood is sometimes  shed. This in itself seems to be viewed as an occupational hazard by Feni and  Imperials alike, Yet when the former feel wronged by acts against them, they will  wipe whole villages of life in retribution.
 
 An interesting development from the Feni delegates that visited Anvil at Autumn  382YE was that these raids were ordinarily staged out of necessity. It is considered a  natural thing that always occurs on land shared by more than one group or people.  Just as how animals compete in the wild.
 
 It became clear that raids between different tribes are as common as it is against our  Empire or the Jotun. Their view of survival is less ferocious than with the [[Druj]].  Having enough to survive is better to them than spreading fear and pain. Still, there  is clearly a sense of division between each group; they look after their own close  knitted families. This is captured in the story of The Woods That Fell. Whilst they  avoid as much bloodshed as they can, they would still be willing to attack and kill if threatened, as sadly my Household has learnt.
 
 The Feni are famously tricky to track down. This is due to their “Hidden Homes” in  [[Regio]] Chambers earned through Idolatrous rites and gestures to whichever Eternals  and or herald the tribe in question views as God. Almost all tribes hold their  [[Dedication]] to these False Gods with zealotry that could make a Surani cringe, making  the message of the [[The Way]] one that often falls on deaf ears, sometimes swiftly  followed by hands falling upon blades and sidearms.
 
 # The Feni of the Woods That Fell
 
 This tribe originally existed in the furthermost North Eastern regions of Upwold  under the name of “The Yellow Flowers”. Hidden from its neighbours, these people  lived under the guidance of two authorities; The Tribal Elders, and an entity known  as “The Patron”.
 
 In the initial negotiations at the Summer Solstice 382YE with The Woods That Fell, the  Feni diplomat ‘Lori’ and her colleague met with the author and other Marchers. They  struggled to explain the exact nature of the Patron: they described it both as a title  and something Timeless. The Egregore Jack of The Land had suggested that it could  be a primitive counterpart of an egregore, others have theorised it may have been a  Spring [[Eternal]] or one of their heralds given the title “Master of the Hunt”.  Whatever the Patron was, it supplied them with all the food needed to survive. This  allowed the tribe to grow larger without having to raid and, thanks to its size, likely not fear raids from rival tribes of Upwold. Those that visited Anvil claimed the  Yellow Flowers at their height numbered at least in the thousands. This is intriguing  since Feni in the hundreds was lately considered a large population for even the  biggest tribe.
 
 Recently, I had found my own beginnings linked with this tribe. This I had  discovered both through a letter from a fellow Marcher and with the Feni “Lori”  myself and Watkin Kingstoke spoke with. Although some may see it as Unvigilant of  me to mention it, I believe it is only Wise to write of it due to what it tells us. I have  no shame of it. If any person takes issue with this, they are welcome to meet me with it.
 
 I was born a child to a Feni couple of the Yellow Flowers when they dwelled in  Upwold. When I was but a few months old, this pair somehow offended the Patron  which warranted their execution. The offense they committed meant none of them  wished to take Me in, yet also believed I did not deserve death being so young. Thus, I was placed in a shield covered with summer flowers which was pulled by a [[Painted]] boar bound in the direction of the nearest collection of Marcher villages. There I was found by the Sweetwater [[Family]] and Blind Deb, the latter, of which I can say with [[Pride]] raised me a Marcher, as my true mother.
 
 It is interesting that the tribe at least at that time would consider giving their own to Marchers, even the children of those who went against their Patron. It may be that there are others in the Empire who have similar origins and simply do not know it. 
 
 # Destruction and Division
 
 Despite how well The Tribe had managed, their territory was within the area that became the great sinkhole known now as ‘Downwold’. When the ground first fell, so did most of them. At around the same time the Patron also disappeared. So, they collectively took the name “The Feni of The Woods that Fell”. The name of a tribe seems very important to them, tending to reference specific details about the group. In this case it shows where they are from but does not seem to be as [[Set in stone]] as it is for the nations they live amongst.
 
 With their home destroyed, their strength of numbers gone along with their most important figurehead, The Woods That Fell could no longer survive within Upwold as they had done. Desperation fuelled them.
 
 The tribe faced a choice. Some believed the best option was to travel as far north as possible, believing there would be less competition in its vast expanse. It is clear they do not have reliable information of recent events around Wintermark and the Thule homeland.
 
 Others among them held they should travel south to similar land. This resulted in the tribe splitting. Henceforth these divisions will be referred to as the Northern Woods That Fell and the 
 Southern Woods That Fell.
 
 It should be noted that this split is seen as a tragedy to them. Despite them still
 sharing identical views, trappings, and origins, this split is irreversible.
 
  The Southern Woods that Fell delegates even went as far to say that even if they met their former kin again they “Would be friends, but not really family anymore”. The division is set in stone in this way and thus their fates remain separate despite everything.
 
 # The Southern Woods That Fell
 
 It was not long until the Southerners would run into yet more trouble. The late Winter of 381YE marks our first interactions with the tribe. As the Northerners pushed into [[Hahnmark]] to start their journey, the Southerners continued through Upwold, raiding small isolated farms and villages in Birchland. A conjunction mission was set to deal with the situation but sadly it was not a good day. The Marchers who went on the mission were pushed back, I lost two good friends: Basil Sweetwater and Scrumpy, folk I had recently had the pleasure of fighting beside in The Onyx Pass skirmishes in [[Spiral]]. With no opposition in their way for the season, the Southerners pushed deeper towards their destination. It was at this time they began to receive messages by Winged Messenger from The Mournwold Tribe in Alderly (Who I will elaborate on later). The Alderly folk were sending messages to one among the Southerners called Rodri. These letters entailed a path into the Mourn region of Greenmarch.
 
 Come the spring, the town of Beech Hill was raided for its supplies during the migration. The townfolk were mostly unharmed yet there was lot of damage to the town which required extensive repairs. The town had never been threatened this badly however and I think folk there were more afraid that it ruined their reputation as a safe town to do business. [[Prosperity]] and [[Vigilance]] is strong amongst those folks. So much so they came to Anvil to speak to the attendants.
 
 Watkin of House Kingstoke to his credit paid for the repairs on Beech Hill out of his own pocket, and all of us in the nation set about striking back and. Later in the Spring Summit we were able to intercept Rodri and took the message from them, discovering a pathway to the Alderly Feni. It seems with this The Woods that Fell would no longer be welcome to join with the Alderly folk, yet it would not stop them all the same migrating into the Mourn.
 
 By the Summer Solstice, myself and others went to the meeting I mentioned prior with the lass called Lori and their fellow kinswoman.
 
 Here we learnt the history of their tribe, the fact they have no concept of agriculture, and of course I learned my own links to them in full clarity.
 
 All of us who went knew that the situation could be resolved, yet obviously it would be illegal for us to make any promises when the Tribe was still labelled as an enemy of The Empire.
 
 Thus, when We returned, we all set about getting a motion up to have them declared as foreigners and despite the tragic death of [[Senator]] Henry Ward, we got the motion passed.
 
 Due to a lack of time and rather chaotic summit, we managed to only get Synod Mandates passed to attempt to ease relations and get the Tribe supplied as part of a cultural exchange during the harvest season.
 
 With Pride, I will admit this did not work out the way I wanted. Making the Tribe foreigners and encouraging folk to offer them work in exchange for food and supplies simply means little when The Feni do not have the slightest concept of how to [[Farm]] and work.
 
 It, however, was not a complete failure and I will continue to debate that. Once it was passed, the Southern Woods That Fell were raiding far less and with significant less damage to any property in the process. It ensured The Empire and the small tribe that fighting was not something that had to happen. Yet starvation breeds desperation. I can imagine anyone in a similar situation would consider raiding to survive when it comes to [[Loyalty]] to your own kin.
 
 In the Autumn of 382YE the situation with The Southern Woods that Fell remained uneasy, yet We had more options than at the start of the Summer. The Southern Woods that Fell sent delegates to Anvil. The first time ever any Feni tribe have done so in known history. I have Pride to say I acted as chair in the meeting between them, The Marches, and a collection of Navarri. The Delegates, named “Quick”and “Rabbit”, detailed that the Southern Woods That Fell had grown as weary of dealing with The Empire as we had with them. At the end of the day they would rather settle in a spot where they would have to deal with the least amount of people. The Mournwold, being divided between The Marchers, The Thrall Orcs and The Alderly Feni, was agreed not to be the place to settle.
 
 During the meeting, we learnt yet more of their history, [[Magic]] and customs. Although they said their piece, it’s also important to mention that We made it more than clear to them that this took up more of our time than theirs. After all, We were taking the time to come up with a solution which would not result in their tribe being wiped out.
 
 After much discussion, The Feni began to ask about the territory of [[Liathaven]]. We informed them of the tragic incidents which had caused the territory to be reduced to what it is now. Much to everyone’s surprise, The Southerners believed that given the land at this time is barely if at all occupied, they could settle in the eastern half of the territory. They believed that either the magic they use to hide their settlements could be used to in some way ward off the effects of the [[Winter magic]], or they would simply struggle through it for the 30 years the [[Curse]] lasts for.
 
 Given they do not farm, they would simply hunt the little game that remains in the territory. Since there are only about 200 hundred of them, they believed carving out a living would be easy. Even when posed with the reality that increasing their population would be impossible for decades, the delegates simply shrugged, and accepted that even if their magic could not protect them then they would simply soldier on as they have done before.
 
 Perhaps there is something to admire in folk willing to struggle through years of hardship in a land as broken as Liathaven with the [[Ambition]] of a secure future for their people. Although maybe We should feel insulted that living in a territory that is half dominated by [[Vallorn]] and half winter wasteland is considered favourable to living with The Empire.
 
 A Treaty was eloquently written by the honourable Skywise Fal; The Marches paid to supply the Southerners as they migrated to ensure they were fed so no raiding would ensue, and The Southern Woods that Fell made their way to Eastern Liathaven. In accordance to the treaty, The Empire would never hear from them unless there is an issue they cannot solve on their own which would force them back into our borders. In such a situation, they would send Delegates yet again to avoid any escalations that have occurred in the years of 381 and 382YE. This was set to last for the 30 years same as the duration of the winter curse itself; once it dissipates and the [[Navarr]] set about reclaiming the land at long last, a new treaty would be discussed.
 
 Despite their ambitions and will, The Southern Woods that Fell would face plenty of hardship in Liathaven in the face of the curses which would lead to new allegiances and plans to survive. This will be elaborated on further down.
 
 # The Northern Woods that Fell
 
 One may look at the [[Conjunctions]] and the raids done onto Hahnmark and only see setbacks. Yet I believe it is Unambitious to see only what has gone wrong when it was the interactions the [[Heroes]] of Wintermark had with the Northerners which helped gain greater [[Insight]] [[Into the woods]] That Fell as a whole.
 
 Thanks to the interactions with the Tribe, The Winterfolk involved were able to discern that the two Feni groups were in fact one and the same. Further talks with them directly with this theory in mind was not only confirmed, it also uncovered their origin and thus provided us with the information you read now.
 
 One of the issues faced when interacting with the Northern Woods that Fell is, unlike their Southern counterparts, they were (and likely remain) unaware that they are in fact foreigners under [[Imperial Law]], which means although although practical solutions exist to help deal with contention between them and the Empire, it technically means hostilities haven't exactly ended.
 
 Whilst half their kin looked to Liathaven, The Northerners continued their migration, heading towards (big shock) Northwards! With the help of Irrah Harrah and a suspiciously favoured mortal servant of theirs, the tribe found its way into Deer’s [[Folly]]. As in Hahnmark they raided across [[Hercynia]], there was an [[Appraisal]] motion put forward to send in the Militia to disperse the raiders but unfortunately it was put to the floor the same time as the Liberty pact so understandably the senate voted in favour of that. It remains rather understandable, especially given the scale of what
 the pact has achieved.
 
 After this, however, it appears the Northerns have gone quiet these last few years. No reports of any violence or raids of any kind since they disappeared. Likely as Feni are want to do, they have found a Regio chamber to retreat into and live safely from Vallorn and more natural threats that exist in the area. Venturing out only to hunt and forage. It seems likely that they may intend to stay this way for as long as they can, left alone from all outsiders across the civilised world.
 
 I still have my misgivings. Mostly for two reasons. Firstly it would be good if the Northerners were at least aware that the Empire, legally speaking, now regarded them as not enemies, meaning no hostilities would be necessary at all, and that trading instead of raiding would be entirely acceptable. No physick can have too many herbs after all, and a good few Imperials would be fine to pay in food if it was their choice to do.
 
 Secondly, with [[Great Forest Orcs]] moving into the territory, there is always a slight chance there could be violence. The Notherners, like all Feni, would not differentiate those Orcs from our Barbarian foes. There has been no violence so far and thanks to Navarri Guides like Eirlys Weir, the citizens of Hercynia are at least aware that such threats could exist to the safety of their Orc neighbours. It is still possible nothing could be heard from the tribe ever again, yet I have always held to believe it is better to prepare and be wrong than to simply ignore it. Further Vigilant observation and investigation in the interest of holding that peace should certainly be implemented in future.
 
 # The Feni of Alderly
 
 Marcher Faerie tales have always spoken about the deep woods of Alderly of being shrouded in great mysteries. This is no different to The Feni enclave that have dwelled here. Often these folks have been wrapped in tales of the region, yet the connection runs deeper than that.
 
 The Marches have looked at even their own kin in Alderly with slight suspicion. They are most certainly different enough from the rest of the nation for The Egregore to have to confirm they are still Marchers several times. I have my own theory to why this is. It is not unheard of in Upwold and [[Bregasland]] to have live and let live pacts exist between Marchers and Feni. What if, over the centuries, such pacts have existed within Alderly and thus blood has begun to mingle with The Marchers there making a clear visual and cultural variation. This connection could have gotten stronger during The Jotun occupation of The Mournwold.
 
 Perhaps in the joint effort to survive, The Alderly peoples exchanged different skills to outlast and resist the Jotun to avoid their conquest. This would explain how, while in truth although the Vandals controlled the whole region in name, they tended to avoid the deep woods entirely. Mournwolders that rebelled against the Jotun also state that any pacts they had made did not last long.
 
 # Arrianne of Alder Leigh
 
 The first interactions between Marchers and this Enclave were a far cry from more recent history. The [[Past life vision]] of Sister Meredith Rosencrantz focuses around a leader of Alderly or “Alder Leigh” as The Feni knew it by the name of Arianne, who was faced with a dilemma of the “Farmers” encroaching on lands claimed by the Tribe all whilst the Feni were facing a problem of overpopulation. This tension with what was likely the first Marchers settlers in the Mourn was so desperate that Arianne’s councillors suggested either covertly sterilising the tribe for a time or
 encouraging a band to split off and travel elsewhere to carve out a new home for those who wished to leave. It appears Arianne took this latter option, and whilst it would be no easy task to find out for sure where this band went, another tribe of infamously territorial Feni do exist in the territory of [[Hordalant]] in the Kingdom of Narkyst. Perhaps one day the tribe itself could be asked about this link if they still remember it. Yet that would be a study that would include dodging Jotun waraxes as well as Feni arrows.
 
 Despite much of my research, the name Arianne has not surfaced again in any written record or song. I imagine any last ditch effort to find a solution there without arcane means would be the remit of The [[Lepidean Librarian]]. If that heir of [[Lepidus]] is reading this then feel free to inquire or tell me off over this idea.
 
 # The Enclave’s Operations after the Jotun occupation
 
 With the Imperial liberation of the territory in 381YE, The Feni enclave appeared stronger than ever and retained a stronger and clearer grip upon the woodlands. Given the goal was to drive the Jotun armies away, the armies of the Empire let them be.
 
 When the Woods That Fell began to migrate, it became evident that the Enclave began to send correspondents to them. Guiding them through hidden paths so they would reach their home. This makes The Enclave unique in that they were even willing to invite The Southerners into their home. It also suggests that they are self-sustaining enough that they have food and supplies to spare, which would explain why they have made no effort to raid The Empire since a connection was established.
 
 However, once The Southern Woods The Fell failed to follow the exact instructions given and The Enclave withdrew their offer. As I wrote earlier, this was when the letter holding the directions to the tribe’s home fell into the hands of the Marches, and the seeds were sown for the Enclave’s destruction.
 
 # The Purge of Alderly
 
 Whilst the paper held no properties in itself that could be deemed magical, its instructions clearly presented a way to attack a Feni hidden home directly. Yet the decision to act on the opportunity was more divisive than some would lead you to believe.
 
 Whilst the nature of Feni strongholds being “Hidden Homes”, aka pocket realms and chambers within a regio was not fully understood at the time, it was most certainly noted that any army choosing this action would be going in essentially blind to what they would face. There was also hot debate on whether the Alderly Feni through their communication with The Southern Woods that Fell during their raid did or did warranted a response. Regardless of any of these pros and cons and other warfronts at the time, The [[Drakes]] army opted to act and attacked the Alderly Enclave in a rogue operation.
 
 I will not go into the details of the campaign. This is not a military history and details of the fighting are better written elsewhere so this writing will focus more on the results and its effects on The Marches and The Empire.
 
 The Alderly Feni, unsurprisingly even with support from their patron [[Wise Rangara]]’s heralds, were not able to fend off an overwhelming assault from the Drakes army. The majority of them fought to the bitter end, among the dead were also Marcher folk of Alderly who chose to fight with those they considered allies or in some cases kin. Two groups survived, the first either had escaped or were out hunting at the time of the attack and fled into Liathaven, likely following the tail of the Southern Woods that Fell. The other group were cornered in the stronghold by Drakes soldiers but
 were “saved” when aspect of [[Agramant]] seemingly entered the area and offered them both life and “Vengeance”.
 
 Agramant is many things, but true to his word is technically one of them. The Feni that went with that fowl creature were grafted in its image and became violent creatures bent on destroying areas of importance to the Marches. Although they did launch a Vengeance raid upon [[Singing Caves]], the bulk of their forces were wiped out by a band of Marchers in conjunction to Walksend, the site of the Marches' arrival in Upwold, saving a nearby [[Monastery]] of healing from a great slaughter. Over the Longest Dark with assistance from the Marcher national [[Assembly]] I did attempt to track any remaining raiders however there was no sign. It is likely if any remain they  have retreated back to the wastes of the Winter [[Realm]]. Ultimately, this was a minor footnote in the aftermath of the incident.
 
 The White Crow, Wise Rangara, was a patron to the Enclave and so was greatly angered with the Empire and The Marches especially. This anger continues still. Through the fine work of Winter [[Archmage]] Syn Nighthaven, and her successor Ematius Ankarien, it has become clear that any attempt by the Marches to cut down the woods could lead to a dangerous response from her. Through speaking to her various heralds both at Anvil and elsewhere it has been made clear the Enclave were like her children and she considered The Drakes actions to be murder, so for those
 forests to be brought down could lead to much trouble for The Marches if any deforestation went ahead. Curses seem most likely. Any potential recompense the nation as a whole could or should make to the Eternal is now out of my hands.
 
 Whilst we do not know what the future may hold, there is a considerable chance this issue may never come to head now. Besides the fact the Marches are now very aware of the risks of such an action, more Marchers that actually live in Alderly still have started attending Anvil and for their very own justified reasons would rather the woodlands they live in and make much of their coin from are not destroyed due to the outsider’s political ambitions. A criticism that could be had on this whole debacle is on The Drakes army of the time, who had so recently been in the brutal and
 controversial liberation of the Morune, once again decided to go into the Mourne and make a decision which perhaps many folk in Alderly could have had views on. With more representation in Anvil from that region now here, hopefully such decisions can be better considered in future.
 
 Whilst many Marchers at Anvil may still debate whether the decision was good or bad, the idea that the attack was justifiable or not, the idea that the whole thing caused more problems than it solved is not considered a controversial take from it. Some have put the deaths at Alderly at my feet and consider me to blame for much of it. Whilst I resent the idea I failed at my job as Feni adviser in a time when I was fighting to make the title exist so I could actually do it as job, I can’t act like I don’t share some blame.
 
 Firstly I strongly opposed army deployment against The Southern Woods That Fell for diplomatic and strategic reasons. But I did not use these points as strongly over the attack on Alderly.
 
 Secondly, whilst I may have thought it was a bad idea, I had no solution to present instead.
 Those are my failures, but our failures guide us as much as our successes.
 
 # The Confederation of Hotters Mire
 
 As the Navarr teaches us “Actions have Consequences”. In my experience from attending Anvil, it is always those harder to see long term consequences that are almost always worse than initial effects. When a stone falls, it ripples in all directions. Such is the story of the vast gathering of Feni tribes that came, and likely still remains in some form the shattered lands of Liathaven.
 
 Due to the forming of the Great Sinkhole in Spring 381YE and the purge of Alderly of 382YE Feni tribes beyond just the Woods That Fell and Alder Leigh have found a need to move from their usual hovels. Some would have found the Sinkhole and [[Trogoni]] forced this, others have seen the actions of the Drakes and have thought if their heathen Gods have abandoned them, or the Empire have found a way to overpower or kill their Gods, making moving essential.
 
 Since those great events, and across the longest dark, more Feni have followed the Southern Woods That Fell and Alderly survivors into Liaven’s Glen. The idea that Feni could do this without being noticed is not unprecedented, their ability to strike and retreat without trace in raids is testament to this and unlike the previous migrations this has been done on their own time and accord. What was truly unprecedented was how vast this gathering truly became.
 
 To put this into perspective, the largest gathering of Feni by Imperial records before this had been in 376YE in the Feni-Applewood conflict. That force of reavers being 500 strong.
 
 The Confederation of Hotters mire had enough numbers not only to populate Jotuna and Navarr settlements built in the territory but to form a fighting force with a military strength of 7,000 by Imperial terms.
 
 I cannot stress in strong enough terms how nothing like this has happened before. That this may be the first time ever in recorded history where the Feni have gathered in such numbers.
 
 Some Imperials just a few years ago wouldn't have even comprehended that there were that many Feni in the entire world.
 
 Even whilst chafing under the magicks of winter which made reproducing impossible, The Feni had begun to organise and build a foothold in Liathaven that had the makings of a small nation, more like the stronger septs of Barrens than any Feni group to date. All of these stunning developments were gathered through a [[Spy network]] established in The Winter Solstice of 383YE and only reached Anvil on the first day of the following Spring Equinox. A Spy Network many a Captain had joined primarily to track down the sorcerer Drustan and his followers and uncover what foul plans the Heirs had for a territory the Empire had all but abandoned.
 
 So began the most controversial [[Chapter]] in this bizarre story.
 
 # The Raid, and The Last Gasp The Fall of The Heirs
 
 A whole other book could be written about foul Exploits of the Heirs of Terunael from their uprising to their eventual demise, but that is a job I believe Nathair Autumgale has volunteered if I understand correctly so I will merely write the planned raid and the eventual unexpected result.
 
 Whilst The Navarri had successfully thwarted the Heirs of Terunael in Brocilande, Hercynia, [[Therunin]], and [[Miaren]]; Liathaven, due to its position to the Jotun and its magical situation, had received much less attention. The Heirs may have gotten free reign but in the end it served little else for them as a corner to rally in when the Empire had crushed them in every other land throughout the longest dark of 383YE. That was until presumably Drustan made contact with The Feni in Liaven’s Glen. 
 
 The aforementioned Spy network of 383 revealed that Drustan and the remains of his foul acolytes had made contact with the Feni leaders. What started out as simple trade turned to much more dangerous discussions. Druss seemingly offered The Feni secrets of how to deal with Vallorn Miasma and “adapt” if we dare to call what those sorcerers did to themselves that. It does not seem Feni leaders such as Urhalin had such high opinions of this offer, nor the Heirs themselves. In future she would have been heard referring to the cultists as “Animals who have learnt to talk”. 
 
 This is not surprising, any people that would invoke the name Terunael so proudly around Feni should expect contempt.
 
 Whilst The Feni certainly don't fear [[The Vallorn]] as we do, seeing it as divine retribution by their gods upon that ancient empire, a “rain that washed the world clean” they still recognize the Vallorn is something to avoid rather than embrace at the very least.
 
 However, Hotters Mire had a greater issue. For all they had built, the curse still stopped any chance for Confederation’s population to grow. Despite their size, almost no new Feni had been born. The Feni will do all to survive. Concepts of honour and dignity mean nothing to them. Druss seemingly knew this, and so whilst he had failed to get any guarantee from The Feni, he started to offer them Spring [[Vis]] for a great ceremony The Feni planned to break the curse of [[Wither the Seed]] in Liathaven.
 
 You can imagine the panic such news inspired in the Spring Equinox following that report. And this was not information known by the Empire over. Only Independent captains who had joined took part in the network initially, hurrying to Anvil to spread the word, even I did not know truly until I arrived at the summit myself and was told. It was a hot summit too, and I don't think it would be outlandish to suggest the fact we were all reeling from the effects of great mist and were woefully out of practice dealing with the fast hustle and bustle of Anvil politics did create a calm atmosphere for any of those crusading against the Vallorn and their foul human servants.
 
 I could find little fault in the decisions made to respond. The Navarr had an opportunity to get rid of Druss and destroy the Heirs of Terunael. Captains of my nation spearheaded by House Hartel and Captain Trevor Woodman bound in oath to [[Mend]] damaged between our two nations after the heinous theft and disposal of a ancient singing stone by Marcher hands sort not only to make up for such a crime, but also found common cause to eradicate this sorcerer’s threat.
 
 Yet even with the power of Navarr and The Marches military as one there was still a great fear the raid on Hotters Mire would not secure the numbers to ensure its success. Independent captains of that summit had a plethora of other expeditions and raids to take part in, notwithstanding the warfronts at the time such as [[Suaq]] and [[Zenith]] which required ever more numbers to beat back the Barbarians tides. If the raid failed then Liathaven would fall even further from Imperial influence, its curses lifted the deterrents against cultists and Jotun operations in the land greatly reduced.
 
 I myself had other fears beyond this. If the raid failed and was repulsed, then a bulk of that would be due to Feni defenders of the Hotters Mire settlement. They would in that moment have little interest in the fact that the raid’s main objective was to capture Druss. Their new home would have been attacked and a ceremony to lift a curse of Liathaven scuppered.
 
 And if The Feni had to choose between destruction at the hands of The Empire, and allying with a group they may distrust but could survive with, they would choose survival.
 
 I also knew that among this Confederation of Tribes was the Southern Woods that Fell, which under treaty were recognised as Foreigners by a Senate Vote and that such an attack could be a violation. Although admittedly I also considered that if the Woods-That-Fell were involved then they just as much could be in violation of the treaty if they fully realised the enormity of their actions.
 
 For everyone else, the concerns for the raid failing was the lifting of the Wither the Seed curse, or Druss and the Heirs continued existence. Yet me and my colleagues feared something greater. If the raid on Hotters Mire failed, then could inadvertently given the Feni and Heirs of the territory and common cause, Druss would have a whole army possibly as stealthy as him at his beck and call. He and his allies would find a second wind, and a new warfront we could ill afford in that year.
 
 The idea of Druss with an army of thousands, the largest gathering of Feni ever seen bent on Vengeance weighed on me greatly. Yet I remained conflicted throughout the summit. Eventually, I picked the only option available to me. I had the ability at the time to send a letter after each summit to the Southern Wood The Fell tribe in Liaven’s Glen. I wrote up a letter with some help from Senator Travid of Therunin and then [[General]] of the [[Black Thorns]] Lleu Tarw and sent it on its way. Determined to avoid a potential disaster.
 
 # The Letter
 
 Unsurprisingly, I no longer own the letter that was sent. Any rough drafts and such now belong to the Militia and Constitutional Court. If folks wish to see some of what was written then one may 
 wish to ask them.
 
 What is known, and what will likely in posterity become the summary of it, is that this letter warned The Feni of Hotters Mire of the Imperial raid to capture Druss that was converging on their settlement in the run up to the Summer Solstice of 384YE. I won’t deny I did warn of it, reports show that. Yet the warning given was far broader than many would tell you.
 
 Ultimately, Hotters Mire was the site of a chance to capture Druss and his supporters, that was the purpose of the mission. I said as much in this letter, and regardless of nay Imperial with sympathies to The Feni there, if they had to destroy Hotters Mire in the fighting to dig him out then they would.
 
 Myself and the others who leant their pen weren't just warning them of the Empire, we were warning them of the danger the Heirs and Druss were putting them in. That their very presence was painting a vast target upon them all. If they wanted to survive and remain left alone then they needed to reject the Heirs aid at all levels forthwith. Only then could The Empire truly consider leaving them alone as they desired.
 
 I also pointed out there were those in Navarr who could help them with being rid of the curse of Wither the Seed in a way that also wouldn't [[Ruin]] the Empire’s suppression of the Vallorn in the territory.
 
 The Feni of Hotters Mire, upon receiving the letter, took the hint. They sought out the Imperials and helped them set a trap. Druss and The Heirs arrived, the gates of the settlement were shut to them, and the Empire slew them all save for Druss, who turns out might possibly be the fastest known humans living.
 
 Upon the Heirs' slaughter due to this Detente, the Empire left and Hotters Mire expanded its control fully to all of Liaven Glen. A successful albeit unexpected end to the raid. The other additional [[Cost]] being a conjunction into Liathaven from Anvil ceasing to exist.
 
 As you can imagine, there were many reactions to this. A fair few understandably confused and or angry.
 
 The Navarr, chiefly the Thorns, generally took less issue with me and more with General Lleu and Senator Travid. The Marches took less issue with those two, and took more with me as could be expected.
 
 Lleu Tarw and Travid of the Longest Path can easily defend themselves without my input here. Their side of the story falls more into matters of the Vallorn, and the military side of Navarr politics. So I will focus on issues laid at my feet directly.
 
 Also because I would rather swim in [[The Semmerlak]] covered head to toe in chum than discuss Navarri [[Thorn]] “politics”.
 
 One of the first accusations thrown at my feet was the idea that through either the Woods That Fell Treaty Autumn 382YE or agreement with Hotters Mire to capture Druss, we had ceded Navarri territory to the Feni.
 
Neither of these are remotely true.
  
 The treaty with The Woods that Fell allowed the tribe with a single season’s [[Worth]] of support to travel in Liathaven and not raid the Empire again. This tribe numbered a few hundred and lacked resources or numbers to hold any true dominion. The land of Liaven’s Glen was not ceded, the W-T-F were simply given the means to move there. Any other tribe that chose to move into that area since moved in without [[Mine]] of The Empire’s knowledge nor consent due to various events written previously.
 
 As for Hotters Mire ceasing of Liaven’s Glen, this was not and has still not been formally recognized by The Empire as a legal ceding. The Empire did not send any armies to oppose The Confederation's seizing.
 
 No blood between Feni and Imperials on that matter as of yet, but neither has the Senate or Navarr yet officially recognised The Confederations Right to dwell there. This will likely have to be addressed one day. But this issue did not stem from me or from my letter.
 
 The primary issue The Marchers had with my actions was I had not confided in any of them that I was going to do this. That I had kept this huge detail from them alone was an issue. Understand that in The Marches keeping one's motives in the dark is often seen as a getaway to much darker thoughts and deeds, so the fact I had kept this a secret showed both a distrust in the community and potentially risked my own reputation as a Marcher.
 
 This I can hold my hands up to. My stealth did me no credit. I should have shared my concerns and Ambitions on the matter much more than I did. I have since then made a point to write full reports on all my actions and objectives as Feni Adviser in the years since then. Many generals, senators, officials, and citizens can confirm this.
 
 I do however strongly protest the notion that my failure to inform people of my nation about my intentions came from laziness. It was indecisiveness and concerns that lead to such a lapse in [[Judgement]], much of which comes as much from how much energy I spend on all the other matters I sometimes literally run at in Anvil. I am many things, but being lazy is not one of them and anyone who truly knows me can attest to that.
 
 There were some reservations about the idea I had jeopardised the Marches oath to the Navarr. In my eyes, Trevor Woodsman, The Hartells and those who joined them had fulfilled their oath, carrying out the mission in great Virtue regardless of my actions. The Navarr for their part seemed satisfied with The Marchers contributions so I feel that issue can be put safely aside.
 
 Some have said I gambled with thousands of Imperial lives by writing and sending that letter. Perhaps I did, yet if I had sat back and done nothing, I would have been making a much greater gamble. Those who sit on the picket fence are impaled by it, I was there, and I could do something. I knew that with the resources I had at the time, with the Title I held, I could potentially stop the disaster I foresaw. Druss and his Heirs, resurgent with an army of Feni with nothing left to lose at his back. A deadly alliance born from desperation and hatred. I knew the Feni would choose survival even at such a cost if the Empire had pushed them to it. I could not let that happen if I had the means to stop it. Would I truly be doing my job if I chose to leave it to chance? Would I be acting Virtuously to choose incaction?
 
 **I did my job**. Did I gamble? Yes. However, I gambled knowing the odds, not on some blind guess. That is the lot of the diplomats. A job as testing as that of a soldier. You try to anticipate the people you talk to, you cajole and threaten and you pray you have got the right end of the stick. There is no glamour, you may have to talk to the most wretched beings of this earth, people hated by thousands, and you have to somehow find a common ground. You work with the powers you are given by the state and you work until you are unable or unworthy.
 
 As for the state and the legality of my actions, I was reported for suspected treason by an Imperial Citizen (Whose identity I do not know nor feel obligated to know). The case was dismissed before it could progress to a trial. I have committed no treasons and my actions were entirely legal. Those actions were simply not popular.
 
 Only Posterity and Priests however will determine if it was Virtuous.
 
 # Aftermath of the Letter
 
 Upon the Raids' conclusion and the exit of the Imperials in the area, Urhalin, a  powerful magician and appointed leader of Hotters Mire sent a delegate by the name of “Rhys” to Anvil on the sunday of Summer Solstice of 384YE to discuss with the Navarr how to lift the curse on Liathaven in a mutually beneficial manner.
 
 This idea was developed by Syn Nighthaven, the Vate who had originally casted Wither The Seed upon Liathaven. My part in this was much smaller. I simply made sure the meeting occurred and that Rhys, who had travelled on foot to Anvil, got to the Navarr camp safely. Because of this, the following statement is the plan for Liathaven and the pact Syn made in her own words:
 
 “I asked for Rhys to hold off on removing the ‘Wither the seed’ ritual on Liathaven as the Navaar were currently working on a more targeted version of the ritual which would affect the Vallorn Heart only and not the surrounding area. I told him that once we were prepared to attack the Vallorn with this ritual directly, I would personally assist the Feni in removing the Wither if needed, and I would act to the best of my power to prevent the people of Navaar attacking the Feni as they removed the Wither, and if required, I would stand between the Navaar and the Feni in their defence if need be.
 
 If we were to place the new ritual upon the Vallorn Heart, and remove the wither, it would need to be a coordinated attack, and both sides would need the [[Courage]] to put aside their hatred of one another for us to succeed.
 
 He agreed that neither the Empire nor the Feni wished for the Vallorn to gain power, and this was a sensible solution.
 
 He agreed that the Feni would not remove the wither for 3 seasons (until the the end of that following Winter) to allow us to codify the ritual the Navaar had created to ensure the removal of the Wither would not allow the Vallorn to wake. He stated they did not require my assistance to remove the wither specifically as this is something they had the ability to do, however he appeared more than happy to delay in this action to ensure the Navaar had the Vallorn Heart under control first.
 
 We both vowed to support the other in this situation, and that for the sake of seeing Liathaven in bloom once more, we would set aside trying to kill each temporarily for these actions alone.
 
 We can go back to killing each other once this is done if we have too, but it is my hope that this will be a step closer to the end of our [[War]].”
 
 NOTE: As this quote suggests this pact is NOT a treaty of formal political agreement. This is an oath sworn between an Imperial citizen and a delegate of a non Imperial party.
 
 Whilst I was not privy to the fact Syn was planning to make such a pact, I do endorse the action given the alternative Rhys was suggesting was to use their Goddess “She who Sings” (likely the night Eternal [[Sung]]) to lift the curse herself which apparently the price of which was so high that the delegate couldn't even talk about it. Better Empire magic and the magicians we know than the unknown magic brought on by idolatrous worship. The only other alternative being to open the very front I was trying to not burden the Empire with to begin with.
 
There were some other topics discussed that are of interest to this treatise. I will save those for sections coming up.

Upon the conclusion of that meeting and the summit, I passed on the information to the Consul, generals, and interested senators and set myself to discuss the matter further with folk of Navarr who still called Liathaven home. At the following Autumn Equinox I spoke to the citizens of Liathaven and confirmed that it was within their interest to speak to The Feni of Hotters Mire about a peaceful solution to the future of that territory and the peoples that would claim it. I wrote the same to the Feni leader Urhalin and sent it via Winged Messenger to her at that very same summit.

Ultimately my Marcher sensibilities mean that even with all that had passed, I was not comfortable continuing with that diplomatic route without the support of those Navarr who have long wished to see their homeland retaken from the hands of the southern Jotun. Should Liathaven fall into Imperial sway again it would be my goal to confirm this course of action again. I would pray any successor to this title would see the [[Wisdom]] in that action as well.

However as things stand I am unsure that time will come soon.
# Hotters Mire’s Uncertain Future

In the Winter of 384YE the Jotun stormed Liathaven, seizing control of all its regions and scattering Navarr and Feni alike to the winds. Hotters Mire was seized and the Feni that survived the onslaught retreated into the regios to the north of the territory. I lost my ability to send Winged Messengers to Urhalin who I assume has either been forced to flee the area where the letters arrived like her subjects or because she had been killed. The glimmer of good fortune being that Urhalin most probably saw my last letter sent, meaning they may at least know of the Empire’s commitment to negotiating our differences whilst we are still dealing with a common enemy.

Given that both the Empire and The Feni no longer hold any land in the territory, neither side can now hold themselves to the bargain made at the Summer Solstice of 384.

I remain sceptical about this being the end of the story however. I cannot doubt the death toll would have been great for any Feni caught by the Jotun. Yet army or no, they are not a people known for ever fighting pitched battles. And more reports seem to suggest this Feni army seems to likely possess a power similar to that of The Strong Reed Armies’ “Lay Low '' order. I think General Amberlain has more than proven ten times over in the recent war against the Fishers in Bregasland that a fighting force with such an ability must not be underestimated.

This army, in whatever state it remains, is likely waiting for the best moment to strike. However, this force has likely taken a beating along with its populace. These people were already desperate seasons before the Jotun came. The curse still seeps into the land, so they cannot renew their numbers.

They may be able to hunt and forage for what remains in the territory, or perhaps loot from Jotun supplies, but this will not sustain them forever. I imagine the Empire casting of Thunderous Tread of Trees onto the territory to harry the Jotun will also make this harder. What their thoughts on The Empire doing that if/when they have learnt from it will be a separate matter.

As for Syn’s pact: In the event that the Jotun are driven away only Syn and The Feni will be able to determine whether the agreement made will still stand. After which it will be up to wider houses of state and the people of Navarr to decide whether they can still abide by that agreement. Yet that day may be far far away from the time this treatise is published. For now, only their wits, their magicks, and their heathen Gods may aid them. I shudder to think what alternatives the latter may provide…

In the long term however only 3 options remain for Confederation of Hotters Mire alone. They can choose to strike at the Jotun alone, wait for the Empire to resume operations in the territory and strike then, or they can choose to leave, leading to a migration of tribes yet again.

If these options are not taken and no outside force aids them, then the anathema stronghold, this proto Feni nation, will fall as quickly as it arose.

The Empire must be prepared for any of those outcomes too. Who knows what else may happen in war or even peace with the Jotun that may complicate things. There are larger issues we must deal with of course, yet we must remain vigilant.

I have seen plenty of people dismiss any of these issues on the basis that The Feni presence can no longer be as heavily felt in Liathaven. That because we can’t see as many Feni around the Liaven’s Glen then that means any real threat no longer exists.

The art of not being seen is a crowning achievement of the Feni tribes.

If we are still basing our response to Feni activity on what they can see then clearly we are in for a lot more grief .

# Feni Worship and Magic

There are few better examples of the degradation of Idolatry than the Feni worship of Eternals. It is one of the most consistent cultural traits of all known tribes.

It is the Heralds or “Patrons” and the Eternals that allow Feni to establish their hidden homes which are essential to their security against all of their foes through the millennia. These are not that different to regio chambers Imperial Mages can employ, likely their expanse and long term usage being attributed however to The Feni’s willingness to bargain with Eternals in a way that would be [[Sorcery]] under Imperial Law.

This is vital in understanding the difficulties of both pro war and pro integration policies when it comes to Feni.

Feni are sometimes seen with forged weapons of bronze or flint, but they have no interest any more complex forms of forging. They are experts finding herbs, but have no interest in farming. There is no need for innovation. What their Gods cannot supply them, they can take or trade from others. Raiding is a normalised pastime and there are citizens who can and do trade with them whether we admit it or not. The moment a Feni chooses to take an interest in matters of a more complex life, they cease to be Feni in a sense. As heard in tales of the distant past with tribes that have integrated into our nations.

This reliance on magic both for survival and guidance means that Mages unsurprisingly end up becoming leaders within the tribes. Being the obvious bridge between our world and the magical realms. The best recent example of this being Urhalin as leader of The Confederation of Hotters Mire. Her sole qualification to that charge being that she was the most powerful and competant [[Mage]] amongst them.

This makes missions by priests to convert the Feni all but impossible. Especially due to the way missionaries of The Way historically tend to try to convert heathens. Feni cannot fathom an existence beyond the realm of nature and those of realms of magic (which in turn I doubt they recognize in the same way we do). If you would walk up to them and tell them that their God-Patron is false then they will simply point to a herald and look at you like you were mad. Then 
shoot you probably.

I am not one to tell someone not to try something. If priests still wish to attempt to bring The Way to The Feni in spite of all dangers then that is their prerogative. But as Imperial Adviser For The Feni cannot endorse that undertaking and the price it could cost.

However, to simply try and be rid of all The Feni through a concentrated military campaign with our armies would also become as hopeless an undertaking. The most “successful” purge of any Feni tribe would be that of the Folk of Alderly. This was due to the following:

 - Marchers so happened to slay a Feni who had a letter from Aldely
 - This letter so happened to contain the secret instructions to enter their regio chamber
 - These instructions were correctly interpreted as directions to the hidden home
 
If the Empire was set on ending Feni pressense for good in her lands. They would need to have a situation like this occur repeatedly, or else The Feni holdouts would simply not be found out. Each Tribe’s home likely adhere to different Eternals, patrons, and have different rules of entry. Said patrons likely all having very different responses to the Empire trying to get rid of their worshippers.

The numbers of Feni in the Western Empire have lowered from the sinkhole disaster and to a letter extent the Alderly purge. Yet that has more accurately moved the populations around and led to bigger problems elsewhere. Thanks to Feni magic one might as well try to kill every rat in existence. “Fenicide” as some call it is simply a waste of time and resources the Empire can’t afford. As [[Emperor James]] said if you must fight them then you “chase the [[Vermin]] back to theirs and remind them why they're afraid to come into your garden”. Just don’t expect you can destroy the lair altogether every time.

Feni tribes have been seen worshipping beings from the realms of Winter, Spring, and Night but I would wager that most realms save perhaps Day and Autumn likely have Eternals with Feni followers. Summer is probably also quite rare amongst the tribes, yet [[Hayaak]] I am sure would have great interest in The Feni tradition of mass murder and violence in their Vengeance Raids. I have even heard the tail of high [[Changeling]] lineage reavers in [[Mitwold]] with great feather mains which may confirm that theory of mine. Although I doubt they will be keen on talking if I am right.

ESPECIALLY if I am right.

The [[Whisper Gallery]] have always been keen on stopping me poking my nose into Feni history so I would not be surprised if they were not also influential with some groups. Their willingness to kill to keep secrets safe may have its uses against Terunael, Orc, and Imperial enemies.This is not saying that much however as they are a nuisance to all people since forever.

It is also clear from groups such as Hotters Mire that their skill in magic can also possibly influence territories not so different to other major powers if they have the resources and control to do so.

Anyone dealing with any Feni tribe should never underestimate their magic. Their lacking in armour, weapons, and organisation can more than be balanced out by their competence with magic from the realms and the beings that live there. They may not comprehend Eternals and their domains in the same way we do, but their dedication to those arts likely means tribes have a consummate understanding of above average lore known to the Empire, and I would be willing to wager lore still not known to us perhaps from over the countless generations.

It is likely something myself, any successor, and The Conclave Orders could consider looking into. Perhaps from the magical denizens they have been known to follow.

# Ancient Link to Ancient Peoples- A Theory

Whilst the majority of this book is focused on more recent history, there are some interesting sources, visions, strange coincidences, and theories to The Feni’s ties to the ancient world that have not been yet covered by Imperial research such as the fine work done in 383YE.

This section will be dedicated to three such mysterious links that myself and other contemporaries at Anvil have pondered and may be of interest to anyone seeking to pick up and unravel such mysteries. The information compiled is also ultimately being formed into a theory I personally have about The Trolls, Feni, Terunael and the Navarr and their connected history.

**Trolls and The Terunael**

 It is broadly agreed by those who study the Trolls and their impact on the continent was unrivalled until the rise of old Teurunael. The first Feni worshipped the Trolls as gods. Whether they still honoured the Eternals at this time is not yet clear, but it's certainly evident that at their prime they held an influence equal or greater to that of the realm-dwellers and they are still certainly revered by many groups today. In hindsight, this has become yet more clear with a conjunction I took part in years ago.
 
 At the Winter Solstice of 380YE, a collection of Marchers went on a quest which saw them travel to a swamp in Bregasland to investigate a mysterious stone similar to that of a Dolman that We believe could be a regio stone or something else magical in nature.
 
 Our arrival in the area was met with a lot of resistance from the local Feni who claimed we were walking about sacred lands belonging to their Gods and so opposed us fiercely. After We fought them off, then realised that the stone was a mere Menhir and was in fact not magical in nature at all.
 
 Thanks to the help of a Freeborn day-mage invoking the powers of the [[Skein of Years]], we learnt that the stone was put in the ground by a Troll. Who was regarded as one of the Gods we were dishonouring. At the time we had wondered if this was linked to the Troll sealed away deep under Mitwold known as Jack-In-Chains. Thanks to the research into Bregasland in 384YE, and with the extra context lent to us by the fantastic civil servant Volkof, we now know the Troll “The Silence That Echoes Between The Stars'' dwelled in Bregasland before its sinking. Much like the Bregas
 people of that story, these Feni who we shall call “The Stone Worshippers” also still revere the Troll as a God long after the Giant’s death. Or perhaps another Troll who dwelled there not yet known to us is the idol who left the stone?
 
 Yet the Trolls influence would begin to fade, and the Empire of Terunael would rise to replace them as masters of the continent.
 
 Whilst the Trolls are by their nature doomed to see all they build crumble and fail due to the ancient curse upon them, I theorise that the Terunael may have certainly encountered and feuded with the Trolls and The Feni tribes we know the Magicians Princes enslaved were the key to it.
 
 The Hotters Mire delegate Rhys, along with many other Feni spoke of how Terunael enslaved their Gods, learnt their secrets and killed them once they had outlived their usefulness. As the Feni were enslaved, perhaps their mages were used to seek out Trolls to be captured in the Magician Princes' never ending thirst for power.
 
 Whilst these Feni Gods could still very well be Eternals -there is a weapon said to kill such after all - Eternals would be beings very much capable of letting us know if such an event led to one of their deaths. That and we still don’t fully understand what the consequences of an Eternal death truly is yet.
 
 Trolls we know are not only worshipped by Feni and other ancient groups as Gods, we know they are beings of magical skill with expert forging, AND most importantly we know that such beings can be killed in a way akin to mortals despite their power. A fascinating piece of evidence to this idea comes from the published [[Past Life Vision of Irada von Temeschwar]], where seemingly she had a vision of herself in some position of authority of law in the ancient Empire, overseeing a trial of a Feni seemingly.
 
 The important except for this report reads as follows:
 
 “The visionary came to a windowless room, sat in a chair on a dais, with an advisor on either side of them. There was a wall of small, bound books behind the visionary, and tables to one side with many candles, a scroll case, letters, fruit, and a well-crafted glass bottle of water with a drinking glass. The advisors were both unlineaged men in long light blue robes, and one wore boots while the other was barefoot. They addressed the visionary as a [[Magister]] of the Terunael empire, whose name was short and began with F (the visionary did not catch any more of the name than that). They were about to pass judgement on a slave who'd destroyed a [[Mana site]], and murdered a cousin of the magus who owned the mana site. One of their advisors suggested compassion, and the other advised a brutal demonstration of power. When the visionary asked why the slave might have destroyed the mana site, the advisors did not have a clear idea, other than that they believed the slaves to be uncivilised savages who would cause an uprising. The visionary asked for the magus and the slave to be brought in. 
 
 The magus was also unlineaged and wearing light blue robes, holding a wand or rod in one hand, and was barefoot, while the slave wore black. The magus's name was Parvus, and he said he wanted the slave killed - he didn't care for the property value of the slave, but he wanted the slave's eyelids ripped off so the slave couldn't look away while his whole family were tortured before he was executed. The magus said the slave's tears would bring him joy. Next the visionary asked the slave why he had committed the crime. The slave kept his head down, except when looking up in defiance. He said it was for freedom, and that Terunael had taken their land, enslaved their god, enslaved them, and where he fell more would take his place. The visionary sent the slave to one side, and asked the advisors what he meant by "enslaving their god". The advisors said they were not comfortable discussing this in front of the slave, so the visionary sent the magus and slave away again for a while. The advisors, the magus and the slave all spoke what sounded like Imperial, although the slave had an accent that sounded like Iaith. The slave was apparently one of the Feni, and the advisors said that "we need to make a clear statement, we don't want to appear weak to the orcs around us and the Feni". Once they were gone, the visionary asked again about the enslavement of the god, and the advisors said, "you know, the project". There was some sort of experiment happening on a creature whom the slaves venerated as a god, and the advisors thought this was a superstitious belief, but they apparently didn't know much and the visionary was in a position where they would know more about it. There was apparently to be a council meeting at nine o'clock that night about it.”
 
 The vision goes on to talk of the visionary’s debate upon whether it would be better for slaves to be informed and “civilised” as to avoid the incident that had occurred and how they took the Feni family into their ownership after his planned execution in a rare display seemingly of decency from a slaving Magister. Yet that is not vital to go through here.
 
 What is however clear here is that the Terunael had found a powerful being that local Feni slaves revered as a god, one that they desired to use for a “project”. A being like this seems to be something of the realm, “a creature”. Whilst some heralds could certainly be describe as creatures or bestial, it seems unlikely a word like this used in such a singular way by a people so magically inclined. From all I have learnt I believe the only known being that could possibly inspire such ferocious loyalty from a Feni of this time is a Troll.
 
 This vision also aligns well with what The Feni themselves have said of their gods being captured and killed for their knowledge. The Terunael using their dark powers and the Feni as unwilling servants slowly began to take more and more from the and make it theirs.
 
 In the heart of the city of Terunael itself lies the ruins of what appears to be a structure very similar to that of [[Gildenheim runeforge]] of [[Skarsind]]. Perhaps the forge was there before the cities’ founding?
 
 Maybe Trolls (and their worshippers) were as far east as Brociliande? Maybe a Troll was enslaved with Feni and forced to build it, or the knowledge and designs taken from a Troll and or their worshippers? Perhaps an incident like Volkholf’s ancestors telling of Ulven and The Giant of Graven rock happened with Terunael too? They found The Trolls and the power they lent the Feni tribes loyal to them and sought to take it for themselves?
 
 Here I will conclude this theory for now. To go further into it would be to stray too far from the subject matter. There are many actual experts on The Trolls and their curse in Anvil that can cover the subject much better than myself.
 
 # Feni and The First Navarr
 
 In recent years there has been more discourse amongst some Navarr about why The Feni did not join in their oath after the fall of Terunael.
 
 Whilst there have certainly been attempts between that nation to strike up kinship with the Feni, even the more effective suggestions tend to lead to bigger conflicts of interest. In the Summer of 384YE, after the letter incident with Hotters Mire, a [[Mandate]] was presented that would open avenues between the Navarr, but at the cost of Navarr completely giving up on interests into their past. A price simply too high evidently in the eyes of the Navarr assembly and I must say I fully agree with them.
 
 There are many theories yet I feel personally the answers are more obvious and unfortunately rather depressing. The important factors I believe must have originated in the different perspectives and goals of the two groups, and how they were treated by the Magician Princes.
 
 I do not think it is a controversial statement to say that the Terunael Empire was what we in the historical community would call “A bunch of massive bunch of Pricks.”
 
Much like cruel slavers today, Old Terun must have employed domestic forms of divide and conquer strategies to ensure their oppressive regime remained in power. Many Navarr were slaves like the Feni, but perhaps they served roles in different groups?

The Feni talk of being treated “worse than slaves' ' which may be simple opinion from those tribes, but what if it speaks to something more based on what else we have covered here? Perhaps the ancestors that would join with Navarr and Thorn were slaves in the form of servants, builders, soldiers, and other labourers whilst The Feni were used specifically in regard to their ties to the trolls, and perhaps for even more expendable tasks? [[Blood magic]] and sacrificial blood magic was not beneath the Terunael. Perhaps the Feni also provided a supply for such experiments without dipping into their other slave population?

On the other hand, some historians such as Elke Sun-mad theorise some tribes Feni may have gone as far as to help fellow slaves and common civilians around the area that is now Sanctuary Falls in Miaren during the violent birth of the Vallorn. Perhaps this is so and the issue came less from different cultures, but a difference in causes?

The identity of Navarr herself remains unclear. Some evidence points to her being a slave like many of her followers. Other sources suggest she was instead a daughter of a Magister. If the latter is true, then whilst The Feni may be willing to help folk like them they would never willingly align themselves with the daughter of a ruling class that had brutalised them for so long. Regardless of her and Thorn’s intentions.

As for the intention of Navarr and Thorn’s oath we can also say it would have not been regarded well to any Feni who heard it. Whether the pair and their followers intended to rebuild, restore Terunael as it was or rebuild and reshape the Empire into something better, the proposition fails on any account. The Feni tribes then and now still view the Vallorn’s destruction of the Terunael as “The rain that washed the world clean”. A terrible yet divine punishment wrought by their gods as punishment. Why would they want to join any alliance to bring anything close to what was back?

If the two founders were planning to make something completely new as many sources state, then the newly free Feni must have simply not trusted Navarr and Thorn’s dream then as their descended tribes distrust the Navarr and The Empire’s dreams now.

Yet all of this may be quite moot of course, Navarr and Thorn could have known all of this at the time. Perhaps they decided not to waste their time by asking the Feni and got on with their Virtuous task.

The followers of Navarr and Thorn and their would go on to form the Navarri nation we know today whilst The Feni tribes would continue on a downward spiral throughout the “Age of Chaos”. Facing slavery and subjugation again by the forebears of the Jotun, embracing more zealous worship of eternals, maybe even some would end up fighting with their older idols against the Kalavasi, Suaq, and [[Steinr]] in the Troll Wars? None of which would endear them any better in the eyes of their fellow humans.

Unless any other solution can be found I doubt the interested Navarr parties will find many means to bring The Feni into the fold until the Vallorn are finally defeated and the ancient cities are reclaimed. Giving the Guides and Brands time to decide their nation’s new destiny, and whether that can or should include the Feni.

# Other Known Tribes

Before ending this work, I will return back to the modern time to write of other known Feni tribes that dwell on the continent that have not had as much of an impact in recent years. This list is by no means exhaustive, and the names I specifically use are not always the names the tribes may identify themselves with and often are just what locals or historians have used to more easily 
differentiate groups.

**The Stone Watchers**
Location: Bregasland
Patrons: Unknown

The tribe of Feni that fought with Marchers in a conjunction in 380YE. Regarded a stone structure placed by a Troll as a sacred site.

**The Medlam Marauders**
Location: Upwold, The Medlam
Patrons: Possibly Irra Harrah

The remains of a force which once numbered 500 raiders that laid waste to many Upwold villages in 376YE until their defeat at the hands of The Applewood Levy and The Boundryfolk. Until the forming of Hotters Mire in Liathaven, this was the largest known gathering of Feni. Some now dwell in part of Upwold known as The Medlam and still harass Marchers to this day but are kept in check by Applewood Levy. The collapse of the Sinkhole and the migrations of tribes west would have thinned their numbers even more.

**The Enemies of Eldrea**
Location: Possibly Southern Skarsind or Upwold
Patrons: Unknown

A tribe of Feni that drove the Hall of Byrchenhal from their homeland “In the far north” until they were defeated in Southridge Hahnmark by the Wintermark hero “Eldrea The Safeguard” in 259YE. They harried the survivors for a few years before melting away into the surrounding forests. They possibly fled back to lands closer to the Hall’s former home which myself and the current Thane Reidarr believe to have been Northern Skarsind or Birchland, Upwold. whether such a tribe could have survived the Thule and later The [[Imperial Orcs]] is unknown. There is also a possibility they moved into Upwold instead and integrated with Tribes there.

**Feni of Blugtahn**
Location: Hordalant, Blugtahn,around the mouth of the two rivers of Hjatter and Volg
Patrons: Unknown

A large series of dwellings that are seemingly left alone by The Jotun. They are possible descendants of The Alder Leigh tribe that migrated west during the days of Arriane. They have warned off Wintermark scouts in the past and shot at Navarri.

**The Folk-of-The-Ash**
Location: Upwold, around obscure areas of the Ash River
Patrons: Sung, Formerly [[Soghter]], and “Capragan”

A tribe that once freely roamed the banks of the River Ash until being beaten numerous times by an Orcish River tribe and Households such as The Hartels and The Balstons in the earliest days of The Marches in Upwold. The Tribe exists today, its interactions with Households and Yeofolk changing from peaceful to hostile and back constantly over the centuries. They are known for their extremely high trapping lineaged which make their appearances almost seem inhuman.

**The Children of The Birchmother**
Location: Upwold, “The Bones” of Birchland
Patrons: “The Birch Mother”

A tribe encountered by myself and others during a missing persons investigation in a tucked away part of Birchland known as “The Bones”in the Winter of 383YE. This tribe followed a being that appears to be an exceptionally old herald of Wise Rangara known to them as “The Birch Crone”, “The Birchmother”, “She with the Green Iron Teeth”, or simply “She”. The Tribe seemed to hold a close co-dependent pact with a cult of primarily Marcher [[Draughir]] who also worshipped the Herald. Providing offerings of Green Iron and and other more costly things in exchange for Feni herbs and magic protection. The Tribe lost many of its members to idolatrous Imperial bandits yet still remains. The cult is gone.

There is a lot more to all of this, I lack the time or strength to write more. Reports exist elsewhere.

**The Gryphons**
Location: Mitwold, The Meadows
Patrons: Possibly Hayaak

Dwelling in the woodland of Mitwold in the Marches. They are seemingly all Changeling with great feather mains and are extremely quick to anger. They have been significantly quieter in the last few centuries, yet some recent rumours during the attack of [[Siakha]]’s Heralds on the territory in Autumn 385YE speak of heralds disappearing in the woods to be found with mortal wounds almost as gruesome as the ones dealt by Drake soldiers.

# Conclusions
This is the culmination of work from the last 5 years, 3 years of which as the first Imperial Adviser For The Feni. When I first wrote this there was no title and many of the breakthroughs and revelations myself and my allies have made had not come to pass. Imperatrix Lisabetta was one of my first sponsors. I can say I am very proud of my work. I certainly feel myself, with help from my colleagues, have set a good standard for both what The Feni Adviser title is and the importance of keeping an eye on Feni goings-on.

Yet for all my work I couldn't possibly say I know what the future holds. Whether relations with Feni tribes will get better, worse, or remain the same status quo as they have for centuries.

It is not that integration has not happened before. Marcher records and stories uncovered by historical research have made it more than clear there are Marchers with Feni ancestors who decided to integrate into the society of the nation in its earlier days. Some would say this is proof integration can be done. Others say that only proves that any Feni that could have been assimilated already have been so.

I have been asked why I would waste so much time and effort on such savage backward folk. Those who know Me may even point out I have lost friends and countryfolk to these people, one example being at the hands of warriors of The Woods That Fell. I look at that bloody skirmish in the Winter of 380YE and I think something no Imperial let alone Marcher should think.

I do not believe they died for any good reasons nor just cause. They died like heroes, but they mostly died because of circumstances that could have been prevented if we attempted to approach the situation in a different way. If we looked past how it has always been and looked at how we could at least try something new. That is why I will toiled on this [[Great work]]. So that no one has to lose any more friends, family, loved ones when so avoidable. Sometimes we must fight The Feni. That is the way of things and if Loyalty to our Empire or homes demands so, then so be it. Yet I will at least offer a hand before I close my fist.

And so, I find this paper written. Written so that I can spread a little more knowledge on events I have found to be confusing to many people both within my nation and throughout the nations as whole.
