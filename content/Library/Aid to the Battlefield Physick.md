# [[Aid to [[The Battlefield]] Physick]]
**A guide to chirurgical and herbalistic treatment in support of a Marcher Army Written by Keeper of King’s Stoke**

## The Duties of a The Duties of a Battlefield Physick

Though the demands on a Physick in [[War]] may be different to those of a village healer in peace, both must know how to deal with similar injuries. Hunters may have accidents with their bow, a woodsman’s axe may slip, knife-fights break out in the tavern, or worse, [[Feni]] raiders attack your town. In times of war, a Physick must attend to: 
- Presence Upon The Field. You cannot [[Heal]] soldiers if you do not follow and support them. Whether at the camp, or armoured and close to the front line. 
- Warding From Malady and Relief from Soldierly Ailments. Weapon accidents, food poisoning, and other hazards of life in camp. Injury and illness will still break out miles from the front. 
- Removal of Casualties from the Line. A fallen soldier is a burden to his fellows who must [[Fight]] around him, and at risk from a barbarian seeking to finish him. Whenever it is safe for the casualty, move them back for treatment, Often their comrades or a Chirurgeon will accomplish this. 
- Treatment Of Wounded that they may Return to the Line. First, stop the bleeding. Then decide if the patient can be treated well enough that they can fight once more, or should be made safe and escorted away from the battle. 
- Evacuation of Those Gravely Injured. If a casualty is too gravely wounded to be treated in the field, they must be moved out to the baggage train or arcane Portal.

## Chirurgerie 
A Chirurgeon is the title for any yeoman skilled and able to save the life of a grievously injured patient who may otherwise bleed to death. In the past they would usually share a trade with that of a barber, but the demands of [[The Empire]] are such that many soldiers are now trained in Chirurgerie. 
- Any good Chirurgeon should be proficient in: 
- Staunching and Binding of Wounds 
- Removal of Arrows 
- Covering of Burns 
- Safe Transport of the Patient to a Physick or Arcane Healer. 

They might fight as part of a unit, or be help and protection for another healer. Often Landkeepers trained in [[Spring magic]] will have trained in the chirurgeon’s craft in order to help once their mana is spent.

## The Physick’s Herbs 
The Physick’s Herbs are a swift and sure way to restore a patient to vigour. A billman or archer trained in their propagation and use is a boon to any company, since they are simple enough to be used in the field, can be carried with ease by a soldier, yet can be produced in great number. Their only downside is they are a touch fiddly to apply to yourself when pained and distracted, making [[Magic]] or potions a physick’s best chance to get up and healing again. 

### True Vervain 
The dried green leaves of this plant may either be laid across a wound and bound over with bandages, prepared as a tincture, or ground and applied to the injury as a powder. The effect is dramatic, as cuts scab over within instants and bruises fade to yellow before the eyes. 
### [[Cerulean Mazzarine]] 
A tea of the used-up leaves is just the thing to take the edge off of a hangover, but the prepared sap itself can knit bone, [[Mend]] ripped muscle and dull the pain enough to [[Walk on]] a once-shattered knee, hold a bill with a sundered arm. Providing the injury is bound or cleaned, the sap will seal the injury shut in seconds.

### [[Marrowort]] 
Oil The sticky, translucent oil from crushed Marrowort seeds. Good stuff for making a hard job easier. If you pour this over a complicated injury, it will staunch and pack it for long enough that the casualty can finish the job and make it back to camp before you need to start seriously worrying about them. 

### [[Bladeroot]] 
If you dose someone up properly with the bulb of this, it puts the spring back in their step if they’ve been weakened by poison or [[Sorcery]]. It’s not pleasant, but they’ll feel better for it. Give them too much or feed it to them fresh and you shall weld your patient to the privy and [[Ruin]] your good reputation. 
### [[Imperial Roseweald]]
Funny-looking red plant. Just like Bladeroot, you need to dry and cook it right, and get the dose about right for your patient’s size. Otherwise yes, you will stop them dying of [[Venom]], but also put them in bed for a few days. Which is an improvement, I grant, but still foolish.

*Blue Mazzarine to save a limb* 
*Grey Bladeroot stems a [[Weakness]] dim* 
*Red Roseweald poison's power breaks* 
*True Vervain body's healing wakes* 
*Though Marrowort takes soldiers' pain* 
*At battle's end they'll fall again*

## Use of Magical Healing 

### Spells 
Any Landkeeper can tell you there are four things [[Realm]] Magic can do to cure ailments. It can heal simple wounds, mend a shattered limb or purge poison and malaise from the blood, by laying on of hands. It can also charge a wand, rod or stave with enough power of growth and life to raise a wounded yeoman back to her feet in an instant. This Swift Healing is best used from crystalline mana, as it needs a lot of power and will drain a Landkeeper’s reserve fast. It’s a fool that tends a crystal circle and squanders their [[Prosperity]] on simple magics. Since an axe to the back tends to break a [[Mage]]’s focus on the task, the other spells are best used a distance back from the lines, or from within a bill block. The biggest benefit of magical cures is of course that you can charge the magics into yourself, whereas to perform surgery on yourself is an impossible task. The great problem is of course that you give up the mail, boiled leather, or jack that would turn the blows meant for you in the first place. 

### Ritual Magics 
There are four simple rituals that will cure specific ills. Each can heal a single yeoman for a single lump of mana in the hands of an expert, or be scaled up to patch up an entire unit. The Sacred Hands of Life is a Spring Ritual to close wounds. The [[Ascetic Star of Atun]] uses Day’s power to cure venom, but Cold Water from [[The Mountain]] is more efficient if a coven is large enough. The [[Blood of the Hydra]] will regrow crippled limbs with Spring magic, and [[Renewed Strength of the New Day]] will remove a weakening [[Curse]]. Any suitable ritualist who doesn’t bother to know about these is clearly a bloody idiot who don’t care for his mates. [[Hearthfire Circle]] can cure all the troubles of a whole coven, provided they all know enough Spring to get in on the act. The Autumnritual of [[Circle of Gold]] will give the coven the power to keep each other alive on the battlefield, should any fall. Other rituals can give the target novel powers. [[Hands of the Healer]] allows a mage to cast healing and limb restoration faster for a season. Day and [[Autumn rituals]] can teach a mage any spell the ritualist knows for a season, but [[Fountain of Life]] will give the targets the knowing of all healing incantations except Swift Healing automatically. Chirurgeon’s Healing Touch will even pour a reserve of Spring Magic into the untutored, and let them cure an ally twice a day. [[Irrepressible Monkey Spirit]] extends this to allow a fighter to heal themselves, as opposed to another. The Winter ritual of [[Fight Tooth and Nail]] offers similar power, but only to recover from death’s door, and with the risk of creating a dangerously ruthless soldier. [[Ruthless [[Vigilance]], Healthy Crop]] and [[Churning Cauldron of Bravash]] aren’t technically healing rituals, but they’ll trade mana for herbs. The Cauldron’s only half as efficient as using Ruthless Vigilance to improve herb yield, but it’s not bad if you have need of a lot of one herb. [[Rivers of Life]] affects an entire territory, and is more a ritual for a [[General]] than a physick to consider.

## Artificed Tools 
Various armours will let a billman splint a shattered limb, heal their own wounds or cure venoms. There are mage’s implements to gain knowledge or castings for any spell you’d name too. More useful to list are the oddments. A healer takes whatever they can use to bar the Labyrinth’s gate awhile. A [[Phial of the Sun]] will turn simple juice into a panacea that takes the place of any physick’s herb. A Healer’s Harness will keep your concentration through the pain of a strike while casting a healing incantation. A Warcaster’s Oath shield will prevent you from losing mana if you have to make an attack while in the middle of healing. A [[Trollsweave Vest]] will let you cast the Healing incantation faster. The [[Chrysalis Pendant]] lets anyone with some fire in their soul channel it to repair the shattered limb of another, and a Bannerman’s Band lets you use the same fire to keep a comrade alive, or channel [[The Ring]]’s magic to do that once a day. For those with the riches, a [[Moonsilver Doublet]] makes the Swift Heal incantation as efficient in power as the simple Heal.

*...He pushed himself to a kneel with his good arm and began to cast the spell that would give his other arm back. It darted in towards him and raked him with a sharp talon. He stumbled, but the draining feeling of magic discharge didn't come. The threads of [[Iridescent gloaming]] that ran through his armour pulsed briefly, and the breastplate seemed to tighten a little around his chest. It glanced down, looking puzzled at the display. He took the chance to kick it in the head and it backed off a few paces. Castor winced and finished the spell this time. There was a flash of searing fire as the flesh of his shoulder grew in, and then he noticed Katerina, free and fighting the thing with just her spear while Gnaeus recovered his shield. He had [[The Captain]]'s forethought to thank for saving him precious mana with the Healer's Harness...*

## Use of Potions 
The various decoctions, elixirs, poultices, tinctures and tisanes that are commonly known as “potions” are a fine reserve of personal aid for both unskilled and healer alike. A billman need not know anatomy nor the mysteries of the Realms to use these, she simply pours it down her throat. Certain of these are of particular note in making the battlefield physick’s duty a simpler one. Here I shall cover a few potions of good interest to our sort. 

## Common Potions
Careful preparation of raw herbs allows their curative powers to act through simple consumption of a decoction or application of a poultice. These offer nothing the raw herb cannot, other than you can consume them yourself. This makes them a good choice in case injury might leave you unable to cure a casualty. 

## Tinctures of the Open Sky
“The Beater’s Friend”, these potions slow the heart and thicken the blood, giving a chirurgeon valuable time to work, or his friends the chance to haul him back for treatment. They could be taken before battle, or held in reserve for a grievously hurt yeoman. They’ve got a second rather handy use in helping treat the dark humours that often follow injury or loss in battle. One even gives a yeoman the unstoppable resolve to regenerate their body.

### Tinctures of the Deep Woods 
A favourite of [[Mine]], if I end up needing to work my incantations somewhere dangerous and so forgo mail. Not only do they toughen you up a fair deal, they give you the [[Courage]] to go through with the job. Winterskin is a fine one in particular for being sure an apprentice keeps his head when his mates lie bleeding in front of him. The danger is is in overuse, creating a brutal mindset akin to the harshest Winter-touched. 

### [[The Sovereign]] Specific
Often called “Pickled Physick” among the bill-line, this [[Potion]] cures or at the least, delays any injury a yeoman soldier might take in battle. Although inefficient in its preparation, it’s a valuable tool for a battlefield physick to carry for her own use. This way, your comrades can fix you up to treat the other wounded. Cures EVERY limb that might be broken and EVERY complex wound. Well [[Worth]] it. 

### Maledict's Medicament
Cures you of any simple venom or weakening spell. I’d prefer to have individual potions unless expecting to get royally poisoned up by the enemy. 

### Tranquil Nostrum
Although providing no benefit on the battlefield, the Tranquil Nostrum has a place in any well-stocked physick’s sanctum. It speeds a body’s natural capacity to heal, allowing the physick to attend personally to cases of traumatic injury and crippled limbs while those with simple flesh wounds sup a mug of the bitter tea and recuperate. The average dose is enough to treat around a half-dozen yeomen. It is a good way to use up spare Marrowort and Bladeroot, should your charges not suffer many complex injuries or exhausting assaults in the fray.

## Emergency Emergency

Splinting and Bracing of Limbs Splinting and Bracing of Limbs Splinting and Bracing of Limbs It’s hardly uncommon for soldiers to take a crippling blow to an arm or leg that leaves it useless for fighting. Though proper bandaging and salving might be needed to bring it back to full use, you can fix it well enough on the battlefield for a time. Setting the break and fixing a splint across the injury should prevent it worsening and let the soldier fight on. Numbing salves and supporting bandages can hold off the worst of a crushing injury. Both take a good few minutes, so if you must be quickest about it, rubbing Mazzarine Sap into the wound should start the healing immediately.

## Recuperation and Care 
The rough surgery and treatment of a battlefield is one thing, but after the fight is done, bandages should be changed for clean ones, wounds washed with boiled wine, and complicated injuries given proper attention. Then is the time to look over your patients with an unhurried eye and to do things the best way, not the quickest. To see to every injury, not only those that stop a soldier from pressing forward or put her life at risk. As far as magic goes, Night offers a few rituals that can heal the mind, and one for the body. The Serpent’s Stone will cure any poison and most curses, though at the [[Cost]] of rare [[Ilium]]. Cast off [[The Chain]] of Memory can cut out painful memories of war or loss.
