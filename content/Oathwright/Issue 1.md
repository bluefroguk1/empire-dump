**Summer 380YE**

# Lisabetta takes throne in election shocker
**In nomine Imperatrix Lisabetta Giacomi von [[Holberg]]**
By Cormack Dun
After four years of inconclusive elections, the senate elected [[Empress Lisabetta]] at the spring festival when habitual candidate in elections to [[The Throne]] [[Senator]] Atte of [[Wintermark]] suddenly threw his support behind her.
Former [[Conscience of the Senate]] Lisabetta Giacomi Von Holberg was chosen in a tumultuous session when several senators were apparently persuaded to switch their votes at the last moment by a vocal crowd. In conversation with Oathwright editor in chief Bloodcrow Ergot the Empress said she was, “Proud - and elated!” Adding, “Now it is up to me to justify the faith of my supporters.”
Iiythos I talal I [[Guerra]] of the Brasscoast was the last senator to cross the floor, effectively handing the Throne to Lisabetta. She did this in spite of a contract – sacred in the Brasscoast – to support another candidate.
Senator Hengest Dun of Wintermark publicly decried the method of election calling on his fellow senators to stick to their original choices. Afterwards Hengest said he would be a “[[Thorn]] in the side” of the new Empress.
A Synod vote with the potential to [[Veto]] the decision instead ratified the Empress elect the next day. The position of the Throne commands powers of state, Virtue, [[Magic]] and [[War]] and sits on all four Great Councils.
Lisabetta had campaigned throughout the spring event visiting the camps of many nations.
Speaking exclusively to Oathwright Lisabetta said: “I have a vision. Many folk of [[The Empire]] believe in both that vision, and my strategy to bring it about. The election was won through their [[Loyalty]] and their actions. My first act will be to ensure that the Great Councils act with an increased awareness of each other.”
“I have a voice in four of the Great Councils, so am uniquely able to see how the gears of the great machine of the Empire can either mesh together or [[Grind]] against one another. At the next summit, we shall set up the Imperial Offices, to get this off to a good start. I have other ambitions for our Empire, and will address the Great Councils at the next summit.”

# The Oathwright Constitution
[[Empress Britta]] is dead, long live the Throne!

The page is turned. The Empire enters the third interim. So a new bearer of news must arise, loyal to the tome of the Empire. We shall witness the processes of state, its [[Prosperity]] and its nations so that every citizen can make [[Judgement]] thereon. With our bond to the Empire we stand and [[Fight]] for constitutional dignity, freedom and prosperity for all peoples! For the legendary destiny of the Empire!

# Exclusive: Senate chooses blood granite!
The Oathwright can exclusively reveal that for two seasons the Senate has refused to accept an offer of cheap [[White granite]] from [[Sarcophan Delves]] while continuing to trade in blood granite mined by slaves in Asavea.
We have learned that the Senate has not accepted an offer of white granite made by the Bedelaar Huisbaas, the ruling body of the Sarcophan Delves despite the offer matching the volume offered by Asavea and at a lower price than Asavea or the [[Imperial Bourse]].
White granite from Asavea became known as blood granite because it is mined by slaves held by the Asavean caste system. Three seasons ago in autumn 379YE, the [[Imperial Senate]] voted to ban the import of imperial resources from Asavea. Only one season later, at the Winter Solstice 379YE, the Senate and the [[Imperial Synod]] largely agreed that an outright ban on the trade prevented avenues to free the slaves from being explored and the motion was overturned. While Sarcophan Delves granite is guaranteed to be slavery free it has been produced by animated corpses. The soul weavers of the distant swamp nation create magical workers called ongelukkig made from dead bodies. Sarcophan mages uses a continuous supply of mana to make these constructs that are similar to [[Urizen]] Ushabti. The Senate has also enabled Asavean ideals through the construction of a Grand Temple to the Heathen Gods in [[Feroz]]. The Oathwright encourages the Empire’s aim of effecting change in its neighbours through trade. But we must question the Senate’s [[Dedication]] to this goal when it chooses to trade with slavers.

**Grand Council meets**
The second Imperial Grand Council to be held in the past four years was convened at the spring solstice in [[Anvil]] by Senators Bridget EastVille, Atte Arrow-tongue and Empress Elect Lisabetta Giacomi von Holberg. Grand councils are rare Events called in the absence of a Throne to bring together [[Imperial Title]] holders when the Empire seems bereft of direction.
Discussing the broad agenda ranging across economic and military policy were the leaders of the Imperial Bourse, Synod, Conclave and Senate, as well as ambassadors to most foreign powers, including the [[Imperial Consul]]. Notable in their absence however were any representatives from the Magistrates or Militia.

**Trade** – Top of the agenda was the Empire’s contradictory predicament on slavery. The [[Asavean Archipelago]] continues to receive Imperial coinage in exchange for blood granite, while the [[Commonwealth]] searched Imperial ships on the pretext of ensuring that we weren’t using slaves, it is clear that the Empire lacks direction on this matter and a Grand Council was a great opportunity to give that direction.
The council declared that the Empire does not tolerate the enslavement of orcs or humans and would pursue a policy of favouritism towards nations that eschew slavery. Whilst this isn’t the zero tolerance that many would seek, it is a pragmatic approach to dealing with the differing views of foreign powers.

**Military** – With talk turning to the military situation, Generals described the Empire’s armies as “overstretched.” The only outcome being the somewhat predictable statement – for an Empire pierced to its heart by invading tribes – that the Imperial body does not seek to start or get involved in any more wars. One attendee hailed this result as “much needed firm direction.” Another called it “laughably obvious.”

**Orcs** – The council confirmed that the Empire recognises the orc species as fully conscious and sentient with all the same rights as humans. This pronouncement came in reaction to continued reports that many foreign powers do not grant orc people equal [[Worth]] to humans. Orc captains sailing abroad have been treated with less than due respect or even turned away from [[Foreign ports]].

“The written word Is the [[Currency]] or Worth”

At long last the senators took [[Courage]] and elected the Throne, making the former Conscience of the Senate (379YE) Lisabetta Giacomi Von Holberg the 20th Empress of the Empires existence. While it has been four years since the death of Empress Britta it certainly isn’t the first or longest time the Empire has been without a Throne. After the Death of [[Empress Aenea]] the Builder (120YE) there was a five year gap until [[Empress Varkula]] the Undying took to the Throne via cunning and guile. Perhaps the current Empress will take the failings of Empresses Aenea’s as a lesson in the lack of [[Vigilance]] in foreign policy and not make the same mistakes.
The last time I saw Lisabetta stand was when I was supporting Atte so that [[Skarsind]] could be ratified for my people. No one won and I said to Lisabetta then that she had the best speech... and an ambitious vision I thought. So when she arrived in our camp talking to my people to get their support, their was little I really needed to ask, Lisabetta’s answer “You’ve worked with me you know me Ergot” Reflected that fact. Thou forgetting my clan name ‘Bloodcrow’ always comes first in our culture was in [[General]] Scars word “disappointing”. I suppose I can let her off the hook for favour...
Else where... the nations prepare in their own cultural way for the Coronation, Leontes the Scribe has been rumoured to have been arguing over whether the new Empress will be crowned or coronated after the fact, while I’d imagine some other Civil servants are frantically searching for the crown, trying to remember where the safe place is. Lets hope there won’t be any embarrassing moments.
**Where there is a silver lining...**
Of course not all things have been smooth sailing as Lisabetta’s brother Prince Jonah Yakovitch and his fellow traitors Guillamo de [[Tassato]], Silvio di Tassato and Valimir Von [[Temeschwar]] of the Printers [[Guild]] “The Pledge” have found after being excommunicated for betraying the Empire for...

# The Story of the Crown Autunm 377YE
In the dredge of the night the rain struck from the clouds like an angry [[Eternal]]. The rain was Lashing off tarnished steal plates and mail of the host of Imperial Orc Hero’s that marched heavily cutting through Anvil with stares of excitement and fear and “oh fuck... what is going on, shit!” The host met with Thane Horsa and a group of hardy Wintermarkers of the Hall of Renweard at a local Tavern. We gathered in that haze in semi darkness disturbing sleepy taverners for the last of their ale before battle. Horsa addressed those gathered, shouting over the rabble of quietening warriors. Basilius Cade from the Autunm [[Realm]] was outwitted by Guillamo de Tassato from the pledge into a deal to reveal the location of the crown. And so we were gathered seaming breath departing to [[Karsk]] where the [[Thule]] were moving it.

Those amassed departed through the conjunction in mudded pitch dark of the woods, swiftly travelling through the forest we broke the tree line to gaze a fort in the haze of rain. It was clear it was heavily fortified. On Horsa’s orders we swiftly made a two pronged attack. The main bulk of us fought the front, while a smaller group lead by Horsa and Bloodcrow Martok broke the back of the fort. There Horsa fought an elder plague wolf while other searched frop the crown. The battle roared on the warriors held and the crown was found. Althalstan of the Susivari took the crown saftely away as the the warriors united and fought every inch back to a fresh conjunction, which was gladly taken by the hard pressed warriors. The conjunction took us to the Hall of Worlds, which turn sowed the seeds that awoke the power of magic within me.
The Medals we received for that battle were items of worth, each one with it’s own story, it’s own viewpoint. Now I see them passed on like their orginal owners, and I think back and wonder which of them has passed and how many still live. BUT this is not a story of ending! The story of the Crown has only just begun, and what would such a story be called I wonder? Empire: The Legend

# Skarsind Negotiations

The tension with Thane Dogri Thulebane has lessened somewhat after Kali of the Saker reassured him that the [[Imperial Orcs]] were being respectful by and large. While some misunderstanding and brash beheaver has unsettled matters previously it is now believed, after myself (Bloordcrow Ergot) and Irontide Vio have spoken our words to Kali, that these matters would be delt with, with the reverence they deserved. The Thane was said to be impressed with our people’s voice, [[Wisdom]] and intentions. The Thane has invited us to meet him at the time of the Summer Solstice 380YE so we can talk further to reach an accord that serves the Empire and our nations.

# War!
The Hierro of the Lasambrian hills sent a Delegation to Anvil this spring (380YE) and offered the Empire three options
1. Give the territories of [[Segura]] and Feroz
2. Do not fight us and we will join the [[Jotun]]
3. Or fight us and we will die and cross the abyss with virtue.
So War has been declared upon the Hierro Clan by our Nation for the Loyalty to our Empire and for Wisdom so they do not join the Jotun.

# Bonesetters
Our nation has elected Bloodcrow Yargol as Civil Comissioner he had this to say:
“With prosperity the Imperial Orcs have found an equilibrium with the Wintermark of Skarsind forging a great trade alliance with the miners at Gulhule {appointed to Irontide Flax}. Another opportunity was taken to open up trade routes at Torfast {appointed to Sunhammer Krag} joining the Trade Network to [[The League]], Navar and [[Varushka]]. I plan to build a strong economic base for Imperial Orc nation to Prosper. My first act as Commissioner was to build and fund a great heard of cows in Eastermark.
Whats next depends on what the nation decides, will it be a great battle magics school in Helheim or offices for the night keeper in Guilderheim. Watch this space...”

# The Unshackled??
A disappointing result from the senate, not only was Senator Miekarovas Motion to make [[Proxy]] Slavery Illegal fail, but also Senator for [[Semmerholm]] (Escalados de Carsenere) decided a law that prevents the annihilation of the soul should only apply to humans. Not only is this an insult to my people, but also lacks Vigilance for not consulting with my nation or others. The move to vote was hurried with little discussion due to an obvious unanimous vote in favour as senators were quick to move to the aye side mid talk, being easily appeased with amendments as they were. This coming even as I called for a withdrawal of the motion to be rewritten to be just ‘souls’. The rebute to this were claims that that it would make killing barbarians illegal because they couldn’t be sure that an orc soul had the strength to cross the abyss. I’m sure any magistrate could have easily cleared that up prior to writing! I shall wait to see with eagerness the amendment to the law that Semmerholm promised to do.


# [[Highguard]] Herald
**By Jaylus of Highguard**


**Reborn [[Reikos]] splits Highguard**
In the past season the rebirth of the long-blighted region of Reikos through the direct action of the eternal [[Llofir]] divided the nation of Highguard. Some celebrated the [[Spring magic]] as a blessing while others condemned the reclamation of the land by an eternal as a subversion of human destiny.
The long-suffering citizens of Reikos witnessed their region returned to a state of pure nature after years of [[Druj]] tyranny. Many of them hailed the event as a fresh chance to restart and rebuild after years of Druj tyranny. The relief of the beleaguered population comes after two failed attempts by the [[Heroes]] of Anvil to consecrate and neutralise the miasma stones, which generated the Druj’s shroud of dread.
It was the brave citizens of Reikos that finally toppled the tools of Druj conquest that held the residents under an [[Aura]] of fear. It was truly great to see the citizens of Highguard – the hearts-blood of the Empire – succeed where the heroes of Anvil had failed.
However, within the traditionally exclusionist nation many were unhappy with the implications of such widespread use of the favour of an eternal. Mages are unsure how Llofir could [[Muster]] so much power. It seems the conclave has no explanation for this large-scale transgression of an otherworldly being into our lands without invitation. The confusion and doubt accompanying these colossal events has split opinion in Reikos and across Highguard.
Many in the nation are furious at the total destruction of the monuments to the deceased in the region, a particularly sensitive topic to the nation that houses the [[Necropolis]]. While the events have saved years of work purifying and re-growing the region they have also, with a single brushstroke across the ruined canvas of Reikos, destroyed centuries of heritage and made meaningless all the proud efforts to preserve the land against the Druj.
The Highguard National [[Assembly]] and the Conclave need to cooperate to work out what happened in Reikos and find a way to help the courageous citizens to re-build their lives and heritage. This may be difficult considering the insular nature of the speaker of the Highguard National Assembly, Sivar, who is a notorious exclusionist who refuses to deal with mages. If there ever was a time for someone to put aside their prejudices for the greater good of the people of the Empire it is now.

# New religious trend in Reikos
In her efforts to combat the influence of itinerant preacher and inadvertent heretic, Golan, Yael, the reincarnation of the [[First Empress]], has attracted more followers to the First Empress than Golan.
The rise in heretical incidents within Reikos and the bordering territories are symptomatic of the feeling of abandonment the refugees of Reikos feel towards the Empire. In their desperation they are in need of spiritual aid and guidance.
Unfortunately many people in Reikos attributed the magic rejuvenation of their land as a miracle worked by Yael, who hails from Felix’s Watch in Reikos. The problem with this is that in attempting to restore normality to the people of Highguard, Yael has inadvertently, and presumably against her own desire, created a far bigger threat to the souls of the poor misguided than Golan ever could.
It is the duty of the synod and Yael to prevent this following from spreading and put the people of Reikos back on the path of virtuousness. It is the hope of this writer that they not only act quickly but also with the Wisdom gained from the Golan debacle.
Swift and decisive action is needed before this matter gets out of hand, at least on this occasion, the person of praise has the common sense to dissuade her accidental followers from their idolatry and back to the path of virtuousness before the misinformation spreads out of control.

# Finance
**By Duke Ferrero**
[[Master of the Imperial Mint]]

# Nevermind the bourse
Why are Bourse resources so expensive?

For the average citizen the Bourse resources [[Mithril]], white granite, and [[Weirwood]], are impossible to afford. The main reason for the [[Cost]] is that the Empire is in deficit: it costs more to run than it earns in taxes. For the Empire to afford armies, mines, fortifications, etc. the [[Imperial treasury]] relies on the Bourse auctions.
Every territory pays taxes into the Imperial Treasury. When the Bourse seats are auctioned, the proceeds are added to the Imperial Treasury. Senators then buy Bourse resources from the Bourse members of the Imperial Treasury and spend them raising armies, building fortifications etc.
There are two reasons why we are in this situation. Firstly we are at war on many fronts. Our armies cost 50-75 Thrones per season to maintain, and we have more than two-dozen. National Bourse seats are not usually bought with money, so do not go into the Imperial Treasury, they cost ten Thrones a season to maintain.
How can I upgrade my resource?
I respect your [[Ambition]]! [[Right now]], the prices are probably out of your reach, more than a year working a [[Farm]] for a single wain. But consider this instead:
Each improvement to, say, a [[Mine]], takes three months of construction. The first upgrade might cost two wains, the second three, etc. After a year of building, and just under 15 wains of mithril, you would have an impressive mine producing roughly 60 percent more resources.
But instead, you could petition your senator, “Senator, I want to build the Guild of Picks on my [[Family]] estate. We have been miners for generations, and with this guild house we will train others to mine and spread Prosperity!”
Your Senator can then approach the Senate and request funds to build this establishment. “Fellow Senators, this development will bring more prosperity to my nation, and with it we will create the ceremonial title of Guildmaster of the Picks! The title will be selected by the Senators of our nation, they will be responsible for overseeing the training of miners, they will speak with the people and come to Anvil to aid the artisans of my nation!”
In the Imperial Office, we refer to this as a [[Sinecure]]. For ten Bourse Resources and three months of work, a Sinecure produces more than a normal mine, [[Mana site]], even a [[Congregation]]. It costs no upkeep to the Empire, because you run it, and you also earn a title. Feeling Ambitious?
You can also speak with your National Bourse holders to see if they will assist, and your National [[Civilian Commissioner]] can help you build these projects. If you don’t know them, speak with your Egregore.
You are of course welcome to speak with me or write to my offices at the Imperial Mint in Tassato, or via the Oathwright.
Politics, International Trade, Slavery, and You
Politics is the key to Prosperity
If we are at war with only one enemy, then we spend far less resources for armies, defence, healing, rebuilding, and we can safely conquer territories. But the only time this has been available to the Empire was last year when our Empress organised foreign policy: many barbarians offered us peace and we were at war with only the Jotun. It shows what a powerful tool politics could be for Prosperity.

# International Trade
I campaign heavily for international trade. Senate can agree trade pacts and build ministries, sinecures, andgreat works to facilitate these to bring more resources and income to the Empire. There are consequences though. The Empire trades with Asavea, a slaver nation, so Sumaah, who follow [[The Way]], declared war on us. But even when it seems like our only option is to deal with the slavers, we still have control.
You might suggest, that’s for Synod and Senate, what can you do? Or you might say, how can we change a Foreign Nation?

# Slavery
Our constitution sates: “-we will guarantee Dignity, Freedom, and Prosperity.”, but slavery was not such a wide discussed topic before last year, so what changed?
I formed the Jarmish Trade Cartel. Eastern Jarm was the smallest port of the [[Principalities of Jarm]], a slaver nation. I spoke with the [[Ambassador]], wrote a letter, and made an offer: Release slaves to me, and I will arrange for to choose to trade with your port over others. Allowing the slaves freedom and Prosperity will reward you with Prosperity.
I had no group, or family, but I met with [[Fleet]] owners from all over the Empire, others heard what I was doing and sought me out. It was the most successful effort to free slaves in modern history hundreds of slaves were [[Liberated]]. Our success was so great that 40 wains of white granite went into building a college for educating free slaves and orphans, and Eastern Jarm grew to rival all the other ports in Jarm.
We achieved all that with nothing but an idea, Virtues, and discussion.
You
You can use your trade and resources. You can speak to senators and priests. Magicians can form deals with eternals; I famously commissioned an artifact and designed a ritual that brought [[Estavus]] to the Empire resulting in a permanent [[Enchantment]] on our army.
If you refuse to deal with Asavea for being slavers, the Commonwealth and Sumaah would be happier to deal with us.
If you support Asavea for accepting a temple of The Way on their soil, we may convert them to The Way.
But YOU can decide. Traders can choose to trade only with the Virtuous [[Foreign Nations]]. priests can go on missionary campaigns to convert foreigners.
I have a close relationship with our consul and ambassadors, who I work closely with and attend foreign policy meetings with to ensure the Prosperity of the Empire. I assure you, reader, that I will always work toward the most Prosperous opportunity. If you have thoughts or concerns please speak with myself or the ambassador in question.

# Values
Many citizens simply exchange resources on a 1 to 1 basis. Some refuse to sell any resource at less than 1 Crown.
Jenny's Rule: Jenny was the famous alderman of Stockland responsible for the Prosperity of [[The Marches]] when it first became a nation. Today, we still speak of Jenny's Rule. Don't buy it if you can't afford a pint afterwards. Sell it if they want it more than a pint afterwards! Economic experts currently put Jenny's Rule at roughly 15 Rings, with 3 Rings left in pocket. This is on basis that most citizens have just under a 1 Crown after taxes, and decent drink costs between 2-5 Rings.

# Craft Resources
Orichalcum: 15r
Tempest Jade: 15r
Green Iron: 20r
Weltsilver: 12r
Green Iron remains the most valuable standard metal and is the clear winner for Jenny's Rule Tempest Jade has risen as more resources enter Anvil, its use in premium items is capitalised. Weltsilver has decreased as Green Iron takes over.
[[Ambergelt]]: 14r
Beggar's Lye: 9r
Dragonbone: 20r
[[Iridescent gloaming]]: 10r
Dragonbone is the big winner after several seasons of interest by Eternals and the only Jenny's Rule resource in the list at present. Ambergelt remains steady given its use in arms. Iridescent Gloaming is at a surprising low, which is great news for Magicians!

**Preist and [[Mage]] Resources**
[[Liao]]: 8r
True Liao: 75Th
Liao has risen sharply due to current events, for the first time in years 2 Liao would break Jenny's Rule. True Liao remains at the highest rates in history ever since The Shattered Tower fought with Dr Ferrero.
Mana Crystals: 35r
Mana cost as normalised after a spike. Credit is given to the efforts of Urizen in Senate to balance the economy and the lifting of the trade embargo with Jarm by the Jarmish Trade Cartel. It is not expected to stay stable however.

**Herbs**
True Vervain: 5r
[[Cerulean Mazzarine]]: 11r
[[Bladeroot]]: 8r
[[Imperial Roseweald]]: 12r
Marrowart: 8r
Owing to the Anvil Hospital providing free services, herb exchanges, and recent Spring magics, herbs remain at a low. True Vervain is speculative as it is generally not purchased, or purchased in desperation at higher rates. Imperial Roseweald has reached a shock high in recent seasons. Cerulean Mazzarine has dipped slightly

**Bourse**
[[Ilium]] Bourse: Imperial Bourse Seat average: 6Th Street Value: 3Th 2Cr
Mithril Bourse: Imperial Bourse Seat average: 3Th 7Cr Street Value: 5Th
Weirwood Imperial Bourse Seat average: 4th 1Cr Street value: 4th 4Cr
White Granite: Bourse purchase average: 3th 6Cr Street Value: 4Th 4Cr Note on

# Bourse Resources
Bourse Seats bought with Imperial Coins will often charge 4Cr to 1Th over their purchase price. National Bourse Seats outside of the League set their own prices. This ranges from free for projects they support, to matching Imperial Bourse seat value. If they do not provide savings to the Imperial Budget of at least at least 10 Thrones per season, they damage the Prosperity of the Empire owing to upkeep costs. Street value is the average of sales prices for the previous season for purchase by Citizens on the open market. This does not consider prices paid by Senate which maintains the Bourse, nor does it consider deals made for funding at more, or less, reasonable rates. Ilium historically always has a very low sales value to the populace as large quantities are required for personal projects and only so much is available each season. Bourse seats are always purchased at a loss as they are either matters of [[Pride]] or the premium is to ensure that the large quantaties of Ilium are available for projects.

# Foreign Ports
Presently there are only two big winners for ports: Rigia (Eastern Principalities of Jarm) Ambergelt, Dragonbone, Green Iron, Imperial Roseweald, Mana Crystals Winner in many sales area, with improvements to your trade methods it outstrips its rivals. Vezak (Southern Principalities of Jarm) Ambergelt, Dragonbone, Mana Crystal Only just behind Rigia, recommended if you need mana crystals and have only just started trading, but it falls behind if you have improvements as you will add only [[Marrowort]] and get less resources than its neighbour

# Artisans Corner
# Which War: Light Armours
**By Landon of Longridge**
Hello and welcome to the first instalment of Which War, my column on the economics of warfare. In each edition I will pass on some advice for warriors who do not have enough cash to get a set of [[Winterborn Warmail]] for themselves but still want to invest in weapons and armour that’ll help keep them alive on [[The Battlefield]].
Most people will wear a [[Gambeson]] or other padding under their armour, or as their armour itself, not everyone needs to wear a full set of Dawnish Plate! [[Enchanted]] light armour can be produced with magical [[Materials]] such as green iron or ambergelt and it still has an effect even if only worn as padding.
The [[Stoutheart Gambeson]] is cheap, an artisan can create one of these for a few crowns and requires no additional materials, usually we can find the bits we need left over from other projects. This gambeson will keep you alive a bit longer if you are felled by an enemy’s blade, giving your colleagues, and more importantly the surgeons, time to get to you and get you back on your feet.
The Soldier’s Harness is leather or cloth toughened to resist one more hit than normal light armour. It uses a small amount of materials in its production, eight ambergelt. But ambergelt is plentiful and can be traded for easily, most artisans will have a supply of ambergelt and might be willing to take payment in materials, saving you time shopping around.
The Winter’s Breath is a little more pricey. Just had the life almost kicked out of you by the last wave of Jotun? Has the enemy’s flank opened but you are down to your last drop of strength? Then this magic armour is for you because it will get you back on your feet one last time, so you can advance, or survive a fighting withdrawal. At five weltsilver and five ambergelt, and may just be out of your reach unless you can find a good source for the materials.
Most Artisans, charge at least one crown or one material to compensate them for the time they spend creating the item. Artisans usually offer to deliver orders the next time the Empire meets at Anvil.

**By Sunhammer Kirik**
Artisans of the Empire, this season and those that follow will bring us into a new time of change and prosperity. I (Sunhammer Kirrik) have created the Imperial Artisan’s Guild, which has delegates in almost every nation at Anvil. We seek to produce a Directory the Artisans of Anvil and their wares, in order to facilitate trade and commerce between our nations, families and houses. Our Empire also has a [[Runeforge]] commissioned to be built in [[Hahnmark]], in Wintermark – The first of its kind. The laws surround the actual running of the forge may be subject to change or clarification, and it is a good time for any Artisan interested in politics and titleship to make their mark. There is much research ongoing into the [[Forge of sorrows]] in Skarsind, clues to the history of magical crafting itself and a mysterious guardian, and I and my banner hope to be at the forefront of this investigation.

# [[The Academy]]
**Academy Adventures**
**By Sagua i'Ezmara**

**Dawnish Boggarts**
Spring this year saw many brave imperial warriors doing their part, but what of our youngest citizens? They have been busy too, guarding us from dangers most of us were not even aware of.
Venturing through the Sentinal Gate the academy’s pupils hunted down the secret lair of night boggarts that had been stealing large amounts of crystal mana for some unknown purpose.
The boggarts hid the crystals around a tree planted in the memory of two brothers who fought and died for the love of a woman. We do not know why the normally timid and hungry creatures gathered their crystals into one place, especially one resonant with hearth magics and tragedy.

**Iron Tournament**
The elite academy unit known as the cadets took on a challenge from the eternal [[Barien]], the Iron Duke. Representing the pride of the empire they fought Jotun and returned with a powerful mystical banner as their prize.
I saw some of the young citizens sparring in the Dawnish [[Glory]] Square and was impressed by their courage and strength, only to be surprised that they were the academy members who weren't able to join the cadets! I can only imagine how fearsome the elite unit must be in battle.
So with thanks to all our hard working young warriors I look forward to learning what the academy has planned for summer, and bringing their stories to you here in our next issue.
Empire Fact: The people of [[The Brass Coast]] wear bright colours because they consider black to be the colour of death and white to be the colour of poverty. Why not use your colours to make this Imperial Pony your own?

# Humour and Games
**The Last laugh**
While this is permitted there will always be: The Laughing [[Cambion]]
The Oathwright has no affiliation with The Laughing Cambion. The messenger could not identify the writer after being bewitched by Cast Off [[The Chain]] of Memory. All details have been passed to the magistrates who confirm no crime has yet taken place.
Last season the entire Empire was laughing over 500 Thrones. That’s how the Civil Service knew it would cost the same for the best coronation entertainment in history.
The League is not about selfishness. It is not about corruption. When their entire nation is tricked they are a people who applaud the show. They congratulate [[The Mountebank]] and laugh at the pomposity to have been fooled. They embrace their new lessons in Wisdom and Vigilance! While the Brass Coast cast out a man for being duped The League sought to adopt him for his wit.
Understand this friends. The Laughing Cambion only targets those who lack in Virtue. We will help any who need aid and we will test those who are uncertain. We are every person who is crushed by the greedy and hateful. No matter what Nation you are in we will work with those who are given less and those who give to others. We are the people you depend on. We cook your meals. We clean the streets. We drive your wains. We guard you while you sleep.
You might hate The League. But while there is corruption in the League we shall be there to punish them with the Virtues and rule of law on our side.
While The Butchers Bank has 500 thrones in its pouch and 150 bourse tickets stashed away so we have to pay more
While the Master of the Mint is a slaver who makes deals with foreign heretics
While The Pledge steals our heritage and hides it in its secret museum and even sells its own city to the [[Grendel]]
While The Gilded Horn owns cardinals and grand masters and is as bloated as its senator
While our Empress is a relative of The Pledge
Who in Spring 379 made it legal to give True Liao to Barbarians
In Summer 379 raised a motion for peace with the Druj
Won her election by a deciding vote from a Senator that was then revoked by her nation
When the opposing candidate did not make the election and found the next morning unconscious and beaten.
And the veto vote raised by her own house raised 640 votes against vs 210 in support. If less than 1 in 4 priests support her.
