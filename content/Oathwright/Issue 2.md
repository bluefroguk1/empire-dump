**Autumn 380YE**

# Throne hit by assassins
**By Cormack Dun**

[[Empress Lisabetta]] was cut down on the day of her coronation by knife-wielding freedom cultists who tried to assassinate her in the Applewood Arms. The head of state was quickly healed as her guards killed one of her attackers and captured the other.

Moments earlier she had been cursed by a suicidal attacker. Efforts to protect her from the  [[Enchantment]] were unsuccessful and she will now suffer from feeling cold for an entire year. Both attacks were launched inside the Applewood Arms where the Empress was enjoying what she
called “an excellent cheeseboard” with Gregor [[Grandmaster]] of the [[Shuttered Lantern]].

The Empress said, “I could surround myself with guards so that such people could not get through.
But I would not be able to do my job – there must be no distance between me and my people.”

It is possible to remove the [[Curse]] on the Empress by making a deal with an [[Eternal]] but [[The Throne]] said, “I have a motto, ask yourself,’ what would [[Empress Giselle]] do?’ Then don’t do that. Giselle made a great many deals with Eternals, so I will not.”

# Empire pays blood money to [[Grendel]]
[[The Empire]] has paid 250 thrones to the Grendel after the orc barbarian nation demanded the money in peace negotiations. Speaker of the [[Imperial Orcs]], Bloodcrow Ergot, stormed out of negotiations at the suggestion that the Empire would pay barbarians in the hope of ending [[War]].

He said, “It looks like the Grendel have the whip hand. Let’s hope the Empire can get a grip before the Salt Lords’ play ends!”

Paying enemies instead of fighting them is part of a new dynamic foreign policy using the [[Holberg]]
Reckoner – a sort of complex abacus – to evaluate each foreign power on its attitude to three principles: slavery, orc rights and [[The Way]], and a forth priority for the Empire – reducing the number of fronts on which its armies must [[Fight]].

This fourth principle was the driving force behind peace negotiations with the Salt Lords. The  Grendel’s request for the sum of money was granted without question.

The upkeep of the Imperial Armies costs the treasury approximately 1,500 Thrones per season.

# Wondrous coronation draws jubilant crowd
Prosperous citizens of the Empire contributed 500 Thrones to celebrate the coronation of the 20th Empress. Cesare Sanguineo Rezia Di [[Tassato]],[[Senator]] of League city Tassato,raised the money on behalf of the Empress.

The Throne pledged to invest the huge sum raised for the celebrations in improving the nations’ hospitals. In one of her majesty’s first officcial acts she made this celebratory announcement, “Proud, loyal and prosperous Imperial citizens, now is a time to join together in joy and celebration, the like of which has not been seen in our lifetimes! But let us not forget, in the midst
of our revelry, that our necessary wars have a terrible [[Cost]] in Imperial lives. I ask that all of us act
howsoever we can, to stem this tide of Imperial blood. Let us ensure that our sisters and brothers,
fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, may continue to fight on in pursuit of our Empire’s great destiny.”

# Cultist executed for Blasphemy and Heresy

Gerrard De Lusignan was convicted of blasphemy and heresy and executed after it was discovered that for years he had been leading a night coven guilty of murder – including of children – and of cursing dozens, including the Empress.

His coven was exposed at the Spring Festival when Wendigo Eternals visited the [[Dawn]] camp and Gerrard was tried at the Summer Festival.

Many members of his coven committed suicide during the audience with the night Eternal [[Janon]] at the Spring Festival and others evaded arrest by using ritual [[Magic]] to kill themselves – according to witnesses they were [[Enchanted]] so that they died by magic when they clicked their fingers. 

Magistrate Seppa Dunning tried him in a tumultuous session at the Hub during which he was  stabbed twice – causing the trial to be halted while he was healed and the perpetrators were fined for contempt of court.

At first evasive, a proud Gerrard – he repeatedly insisted that witnesses and even the magistrate correct the pronounciation of his name – eventually cracked and admitted his guilt in the court.

Due to the threatening nature of the crowd, which included many of Gerrard and his coven’s victims, Magistrate Seppa decided that justice should be served immeditaly. [[Dawn Egregore]] Lady Griffonsbane asked to be the one to carry out the sentence. Gerrard was hauled into the street by an angry mob where Griffsonbane slit his throat.

She said of Gerrard De Lusignan,  “He had been damaging the Empire for many years.” Dawn Egregore Galen D’ Rondell said that Gerrard had had a particular enmity for House Novarion
and had cursed Uthor the Bull Rondell at his wedding.

Galen had alerted the authorities when he recognised Wendigo Heralds, which visited Gerard in the
Dawn camp, by the eyeballs hanging from their belts. Galen said, “We always thought Gerrad’s group were eccentric and a minor nuisance but they kept dark magic concealed behind their
courtly manners. They were freedom cultists following the Demon of Janon and they sought only to create hatred and stir up trouble.”

# Foreign powers may join empire
Imperial policy-makers are developing an accession path to provide guidance to foreign powers
wishing to join the Empire. An accession treaty is being drafted that will, if it is agreed by the senate, give a route to other nations to join the Empire. Senator Bridget of [[Mitwold]], [[The Marches]], who is advising Empress Lisabetta on foreign policy matters said, “We cannot comment on the state of negotiations with foreign powers on any eventual membership of the Empire without prejudicing proceedings.”

However a highly-placed source who did not want to be named told The Oathwright, “The [[Commonwealth]]’s interests are the most closely aligned with our own.” The Commonwealth is a principled military dictatorship several weeks sailing to the south-east of the Empire. While it follows The Way, its priests rejected the Synod.

# Crown stolen

The crown was stolen and given to the distant southern nation [[Sumaah Republic]] by someone using a boon with the Eternal [[Prospero]]. Noone knows when the crime was committed because the crown was switched with a fake crown made by The Pledge publishers the Printer’s [[Guild]] of [[The League]]. Denying that the current members had anything to do with this crime the remaining Printer’s Guild members were said to be “aghast.”

To minimise the damage to its reputation the group is seeking a Synod statement that asserts that the culprit is no longer a member of the guild.

The Empress has asked The League group she founded, The House of the Seven Mirrors, to get the
crown back from [[Sumaah]]. Horsa, Thane of the Renwyrd in [[Wintermark]], gave the Throne a Sumaah religious icon to help in the diplomatic mission.

# From first principles
**By Bridget Eastville Senator for Mitwold, The Marches**

Members of the Senate, Military Council and Conclave met last summit to draft a long overdue foreign policy. At the invitation of the Imperatrix, the group agreed the principles that will form our foreign policy.

Our core principle is The Way - surviving as an Empire in order to spread The Way and to allow all
sapient beings to fulfil their destinies. As such, our three priorities, in order of importance have to
be: first to preserve the Empire, second that slavery is contrary to our principles, and third that orcs
are considered equal citizens.

This means that, wherever the safety and future of the Empire is not at risk, we will use all of our
influence in trading, military, magical and political arenas to bring an end to slavery, and a [[Recognition]] of orcs as equal beings.

All future interactions with foreign and barbarian nations, and with eternals under emnity, amnity
and neutrality should keep these three priorities in mind. Both the Senate and the Synod stated that, “The enslavement of sapient beings is contrary to the defining principles of the Empire, 
our constitution, and The Way of Virtue.”

We hope that a cohesive and consistent policy in our dealings with outside nations will win us the respect and influence that we have been struggled to achieve since Britta’s death. While the battles
against slavery, to secure the orcs an equal footing and to spread The Way will not be quickly won, it is my sincere belief that they are winnable and that this is a bold step towards that victory.

# Military thought
**Tancred de Rondell, [[General]] of Dawnish army the [[Hounds of Glory]] explains the strategy behind the movements of the Empire’s armies.**

Imperial armies can hold on one main front while attacking on another. In specific circumstances
and with our new armies it is even possible to attack in multiple areas but some sacrifices still need to be made. The choice between [[Ambition]] and protecting imperial lives remains at the forefront of the mind of an imperial general.

# [[Druj]]
Finally in [[The Barrens]] and on the Eastern front the main development has been the orcs of the Forest of Peytaht being given refuge by the [[Navarr]]. This should speed along the collapse of the remaining armies despite only two armies now being committed on that front. 

The looming threat of the return of the Druj though is likely not to be too far away. With the depth of commitment in the west and risk from the South it will be a near impossible balancing act for
the military if this does happen before significant progress can be made elsewhere.

For this all eyes really are turned to those who manage Imperial diplomacy as for them to continue
to precipitate conflict and refuse to compromise will leave us fighting un-winnable wars.

# Grendel
Against the Grendel we have been fighting more aggressively in [[Spiral]], [[Urizen]], with the primary aim being to liberate Ossuary and with it the [[Legacy]] and the necessary proportion of the territory to return it to Imperial control.

As this was achieved through heroic action through the Gate, the armies there were set up to defend with the expectation based on intercepted orders that the Grendel will be falling back. This will give the armies stationed there a chance to recover some of their losses ahead of the campaign season between Autumn and Winter.

Meanwhile efforts are being made to prevent the Grendel from suddenly looting another city as they did with League city [[Sarvos]]. Armies requiring resupply have been mostly positioned along the
south coast to ensure that there is resistance wherever Grendel might try to land.

# [[Jotun]]

In previous seasons we have allowed the Jotun to spend the lives of their warriors to make gains in [[Mournwold]] in the Marches, [[Kahraman]] in [[The Brass Coast]] and [[Kallavesa]] in Wintermark, while we have chosen to limit our losses and in doing so lost some ground. This has been a common method for waging war under this council, as enemy soldiers who do not return to fight another season make each consecutive season weigh more heavily in our favour. 

It has been difficult to bear for the people of those lands but their sacrifices have helped create a situation where we are better able to take advantage of this in the past season. In order to take advantage of the specialisations the different nations bring to bear across the front a well
organised defence of Greensward in Mournwold is planned; while in the mountains of Kahraman a bold push is being aimed at the Serra Briante region. The Briante valley and its mines were ceded when it was decided to favour an opportunity through the Gate against the Jotun in the desolate Mournwold.

In Kallavesa, Wintermark, we aim to prove the value of strategic magic as the fortresses raised from
the swamps and forests should continue to stymie any Jotun advance there and tie up one of their armies without us needing to commit forces of our own.

# Imperial Orcs And Proud
All my people take [[Pride]] in the name they were gifted by [[Emperor Ahraz]]. We are the Imperial Orcs and we will always be the Imperial Orcs. More than any nation we put what is best for the Empire first. Our [[Loyalty]] is undoubted. We are loyal to the core! We are proud to be Imperial Orcs!

It is for this reason that the Throne knows we can be trusted, even if some disagree with our methods. It is no surprise that the Empress sees the benefits of her most loyal, her most fierce fighters.

Lisbeth asked me if would we take other orcs into our nation, I said that it is unlikely now. We have
welcomed some of the Shattered Sun but like us they were slaves once. We are the same, except that the Shattered Sun did not take Emperor Ahraz’s offer to join the Empire at the time of the orcslave rebellion.

After further consideration, I now add that it is impossible for culturally different orcs to join the Imperial Orcs. This includes Jarmish refugees. To allow another [[Tribe]] with its own history and culture to join us would be to permit a cultural dilution. And that is against the constitution that Imperial Orcs are proud to uphold.

**Lacklustre**

We have a saying in the Imperial Orcs, “Everything must be fought for.” Why? Because if it is not the bearers are not up to task. This is very much the case for [[Imperial Consul]] Aureliana Perpetua Nicasia Saverio di Sarvos who won  her position as the diplomatic voice of the Empire at the Summer festival 380 YE.

The visit of the Grendel delegation confirmed my fears. While I have nothing against the human in question she does not have what it takes. The Imperial Consul didn’t even try to haggle to save throwing 250 Thrones away to the Salt Lords. No doubt they still laughing their heads
off at that joke.

We didn’t even get a one Throne discount for beer money? This is not the person to present a firm lead for trade treaties that will see slavery banned and the Empire Prosper. This Grendel insult has gone over the heads of a state that has already forgotten the many lives lost in Dawnguard.

To defeat the Grendel we should not be giving them money. We should be taking their money. Stormcrow Rorks said that war in the barrens could prove expensive for the Salt Lords, if we raided their vulnerable supply lines until they ran out of money. Instead we have given them the time and money they need. Something has to change

# Roadmap for freedom

At this summit I addressed the Senate and said, “This is the first time I have used my power of address to the Senate as I believe in brevity in this house, but it should not be at the cost of the
process of state. Allowing an illconceived law of annihilation to pass without full debate.”

Ironically the motion by Escalados de Carsenere, Senator of [[Semmerholm]], Dawn failed [[Scrutiny]]. Stern, League Senator for Holberg, who seconded the motion apologised after my announcement. He said,

“I am a new senator and I didn’t fully understand.” [[Wisdom]] teaches we can’t know all. He added, “I’m very embarrassed.”

The motion stated that it should be illegal to destroy ‘human’ souls and it seems to be based on the ramblings of Isaac di Sarvos in his [[Statement of Principle]] (Winter 379YE No. 24), which is a repetition of the Doctrine of Human Destiny. In their rush to push this insult to the Imperial Orcs, they stumbled on the rock of the constitution and are undone. 

This is new evidence of the old prejudice against my people. Prejudice we know from inquisitions
against Imperial Orcs for talking of their Ancestors with Pride and our loyalty to the fallen. They fear it is idolatry, but it is not, it is a virtuous connection.

Now we must ask ourselves where are our doctrines? Where is the Doctrine of Imperial Orc Destiny? The Doctrine of the Ancestors? And where is the Doctrine of the Abyss?

In the second half of my proclamation to the senate I spoke about slavery and trade, “My people are already disenfranchised. But when this Empire uses [[Proxy]] slavery which is no different to slavery; this is an insult to my people and our history. That is why I have written this Final Motion that will transform the constitution so that all trading with slavers is banned. I will be receiving signatures of support from senators, cardinals and the like.”

The Empire is still being being built by slaves. This must be an uncomfortable truth to those humans that already bear an unvirtuous scar upon their souls for their part in slavery in past lives.

This motion will make an amendment to the Constitution in the Senate Section. At the end of the following sentence, “The Senate will assume responsibility for relations with other nations,”, insert the following, “ensuring that [[Prosperity]] is not at freedom’s cost (9b).” (9b) Prosperity is in context defined as Imperial trade with [[Foreign Nations]] and freedom is the guarantee to the people of trade
partner nations that they not be subjected to slavery.

I will seek the signature of the Throne, of senators and cardinals and all who will show support for
this constitutional change. I call on all that seek to put an end to slavery and an end to the Empire’s
complicity in denying others the chance to follow virtue. What can you do? Talk to your senators, your generals, cardinals and priests make your voice heard and it will bring the change that is has been sorely needed.

# Cold compromise
**An interview with Thane Tobrytan Dun of Dunhearth**

Wintermark has been exposed as suffering from a dearth of bold leadership after the Thanes’ Council was branded a "shambles" by an anonymous source. Thanes' Council meetings - theoretically the powerhouse of the Empire's largest and most powerful nation - were described as "The humble leading the brave." To find out more The Oathwright’s Editor-in-chief, Cormack Dun, spoke to Thane Tobrytan of Dunhearth hall. 

The Thane’s Council has come in for criticism lately. Has that always been the case? 

Tobrytan: No, we must remember the proud landmark decision the council made to surrender [[Skarsind]]. In a symbol of supreme sacrifice after hours of debate the council decided to give the territory of Skarskind to the Imperial Orcs in recognition for their sacrifices for the Empire.

As the Empire’s strongest military power Wintermarkers are used to dying for our fellow citizens so it was natural for us to make this sacrifice. The thanes felt it was the loyal thing to do and that is was in our Pride to make such a decision. That majority vote genuinely represented the will of the Mark as each thane had consulted with their own halls before casting his or her lot.

“The majority of thanes agreed that to take the field and break the treaty would [[Shatter]] our skein and our virtue.” Are there other examples of the Thanes’ council taking such selfless decisions?

Tobrytan: In Autumn 379YE, The Military Council at the behest of the Senate decided to make a sneak attack against a Jotun fort in violation of an Imperial treaty. They dressed this up as a ‘raid’ which was allowed by the treaty. There was a collective feeling in the Mark that this was a breaking of our word, hence our skein – the destiny that each Wintermarker makes for themselves – and a violation of the virtue of Loyalty to our word.

The majority of thanes agreed that to take the field and break the treaty would shatter our skein and our virtue. In a token of our own [[Worth]] of Loyalty, a decision was made that if any Halls of Wintermark took the field then all should go. But – and this was voted by unanimous decision
– if we took the field this time then the Senate, the Military Council and the Empire as a whole
should know our anger. Many Halls also swore they would never again fight as oathbreakers.

That battle was a victory but it was followed by more raiding by the Jotun, wasn’t it?

Tobrytan: Yes, two halls took the field and the others followed as we had agreed. We won but the Jotun hate us more than ever and more importantly don’t trust us not to break treaties. “...the council is down on one knee.”

In Spring 380YE, the Thanes’ Council again heard that there was still no action. There was no statement made to the Senate, no process of any kind. A sense of inaction, apathy, lethargy seized the council and led to a further breaking of the nation’s Skein.

Almost the entire council now wanted to forget the unanimous will of the Mark. A national [[Assembly]] of Wintermark in Summer 380 YE made the simpering decision that a statement of principle would not be in our interests and no virtue had been broken.

Many in the Mark and the Jotun whose spies will have reported all this now think that  Wintermarkers are oathbreakers. We have a saying in Wintermark, “The cold does not compromise.”

Well, sadly it seems that these days the cold does compromise. Thane Dogri Thulebane has refused
to surrender Crow’s Ridge in Skarsind to the Imperil Orcs. 

What has the Thanes’ Council done?

Tobrytan: Dogri Thulebane’s rebellion against the will of Wintermark shames us all. He said that the
Imperial Orcs are no better than [[Thule]]. When he refused to meet the Thanes’ Council at the [[Anvil]]
Witan he said it was because he thought his life would be in danger in Anvil– a grievous insult to the hospitality of all the Halls of Wintermark. Dogri said that only folk of Skarskind had a say in its fate which is spitting on the memory of those of [[Hahnmark]], Kallevesi, Semersuaq who died for its recapture in two hard years of bloody war. He has rejected all offers of negotiation and plans to dig in further and only communicates on his own land or through messengers. In recent council I called him out for his unvirtuous actions and named him a coward.

But there is one thing I must respect about Dogri and that is that he is clearly uncomprising as a Wintermarker should be. But the council is down on one knee and offering him everything to leave. Once again, the cold is compromising.

# Stonewalled in skarsind
The Skarsind rebel Thane Dogri Thulebane continues to drag his heals and we can’t find a conjunction to begin talks. He sent a trader to try and gather [[White granite]] to build a wall
around Crows’ Reach. The Raising of the Wintermarks third army has proven fortuitous
and may be the elixir that remedies Skarsinds ills and could be a face saving exit for Thulebane.

# Red roads

The Blood Red Roads [[Great work]] will connect twelve Imperial territories in eight nations,
bringing great prosperity to the Empire. We are now raising funds for future phases to connect other territories and the remaining nations. All who help, whether by sponsoring a milestone or naming a road, will be recorded on the Pillar of Benefactors. To donate, please speak to the
Overseer General, Lorenzo ‘La Volpe’ of the Bloody Butchers Guild of [[Temeschwar]]. The rights to name the first highways will be offered at the public auctions Autumn Equinox 380YE

# Prosperity and war
**By Duke Ferrero [[Master of the Imperial Mint]]**

The Empress agreed the funding of the armies before considering the budget. She hoped that after the summer summit we could find places to cut the deficit. Her advisors and I agreed that it is not possible to cut spending. I have carefully managed the deficit for two years. I pushed against senators’ careless spending, I was forced to hold back the guerdon in order for us to keep
our civil servants protected and the Empire functioning and I ensured that we kept enough in our
coffers to prevent failings. At the past festival, the Senate applauded me for the most robust Summer budget in memory.

The end result is that unless we wish to pull down fortifications, dismiss armies, shut down bourse
resources, or put the civil service at risk, the only saving we can make would be taking away the
seven Thrones the [[High Exorcist]] receives. But the citizens can support our Empress. If the populace switch their resources to military units and send those units to fight for the Empire we can have the military we need. In return the treasury will pay more. A field army is equivalent to 50 military units, if we pay 1 Throne to every commander of a [[Military unit]] the cost will equal the upkeep of a regular army – but it will need no bourse resources.

Citizens will receive one throne per military unit. They will be as wealthy as members of The League
– they will be able to afford bourse resources. There will be less money in the senate budget – donations of coin and bourse resources will be necessary. The citizens of the Empire can achieve this. The Imperatrix has already inspired 500 Thrones for the greatest celebrations in living history!

First citizens must report their military units to their generals. Then, on Saturday, I will put the roll of military units in the Imperial Office. The Quartermaster General will announce which armies will
pay out the guerdon after the summit. Military units that assist those armies receive the pay-out of one Throne per military unit. The following season citizens report how much they received, and
we recalculate the guerdon from thereon out.

# Price list
Duke Fererro lists his view of resource prices:

Orichalcum 15r 
tempest jade 15r
Green iron 20r 
weltsilver 12r
[[Ambergelt]] 14r 
beggar's lye (up) 8r
(down) dragonbone 20r 
[[Iridescent gloaming]] (up) 12r
Iridescent gloaming starts to rise. Beggar's lye continues to fall.

[[Liao]] 8r true liao (down) 45T
Liao is still hard to sell at Anvil.

True liao returns to a more reasonable price.

Mana crystals 35r
True vervain 5r 
[[Cerulean Mazzarine]] (up) 12r 
[[Bladeroot]] 8r 
[[Imperial Roseweald]] (up) 10r 
marrowart 8r

Anvil Hospital providing free services, herb exchanges, and recent Spring magics keep herbs at a low. 
[[Ilium]] bourse: [[Imperial Bourse]] seat average 6T Street value 2T 
[[Mithril]] bourse: Imperial bourse seat average 3T 7C Street value 5T 
[[Weirwood]] Imperial bourse seat average 4T 1C Street value 4T 4C
White granite: Bourse purchase average: 3T 4C 4R Street value 4T 4C 

National bourse seats outside of the League set their own prices. These range from free for projects they support, to matching Imperial bourse seat value. If they do not provide savings to the Imperial budget of at least at least 10 Thrones per season, they damage the Prosperity of the Empire owing to upkeep costs. Street value is the average of sales prices for the previous season for purchase by citizens on the open market. This does not consider prices paid by the Senate which maintains the Bourse, nor does it consider deals made for funding at more, or less,
reasonable rates. Ilium historically always has a very low sales value to the populace as large quantities are required for personal projects and only so much is available each season. Ilium
bourse seats are always purchased at a loss as they are either matters of pride or the premium is to ensure that the large quantities of Ilium are available for projects.

Best foreign Port: Rigia (Eastern [[Principalities of Jarm]]) ambergelt, dragonbone, green iron, imperial
roseweald, mana crystals with improvements to your trade methods it outstrips its rivals. Vezak (Southern Jarm) ambergelt, dragonbone, mana crystal. Not as good as Rigia but  recommended if you need mana crystals and have only just started trading, but it falls behind if you have  improvements.

# Dispatches
Avast and bloody battle for the Serra Briante valley and the Great [[Mine]] in Kahraman, Brass
Coast has left 10,000 orcs and humans dead and [[Liberated]] the mine. The Imperial armies were the Brass Coasts’ [[Fire of the South]] and [[Red Wind Corsairs]], Wintermark’s [[Fist of the Mountains]], Dawn’s
Hounds of [[Glory]], The League’s [[Wolves of War]], The Marches’ [[Bounders]], Navarr’s The Quiet
Step and the Imperial Orcs’ [[Summer Storm]] – all told 35,000 fighting humans and orcs.
Wintermark and Jotun permitted the honourable treatment of the dead on both sides. Navarr desecrated fallen Jotun and the barbarians responded by killing 100 civilians in the town of Briante.
The Jotun aided by the Summer Eternal [[Cathan Canae]] continue to resist in the Damatian hills.

[[Astolat]] in Dawn was attacked by an army of walking corpses from Semmerlak that crossed Semerholm. Fortunately the [[Golden Axe]] army of [[Varushka]] was resupplying nearby and was able to destroy the mysterious enemy.

Gryphon's Pride and the [[Golden Sun]] armies from Dawn made slow progress against light resistance in Carmine, the Barrens. They report that the Druj have retreated from the region.

Navarr volunteers from [[Liathaven]] under the banner of the Blackthorns army and aided by
their dead – made to stand fight by [[Winter magic]] – have retaken Beacon Point in Liathaven, Navarr,
from the Jotun. The orc tribe has held Beacon Point since winter 379 YE. The Blackthorns’ attack
routed many Jotun. Fighting continues in Western Scout. The [[Citadel Guard]] – Urizen’s
only army – have entered Tamarbode in [[Reikos]], [[Highguard]], which was claimed by the Spring
eternal [[Llofir]] after it used its magic powers to overthrow the Grendel in the territory. The Imperial
force met only light resistance form spores and animated plants. The army now approaches
the region of Tamarbode which Llofir has claimed as its own.

More than 30,000 Jotun assaulted and captured the town of Overton in Mournwold, the Marches and its castle, Orchard’s Watch. The defenders – 20,000 in all – included The Marches’ armies the [[Drakes]], [[Strong Reeds]] and [[Tusks]], as well as the Imperial Orc’s [[Winter Sun]] and Highguard’s [[Granite Pillar]]. The whole of Mournwold is now under Jotun dominion.

The first [[Imperial navy]] in more than 200 years, the [[Freeborn Storm]] of Brass Coast,
was defeated and badly damaged by a much larger Grendel [[Fleet]] off Rebekah's Leap in [[Redoubt]], Urizen. The Brass Coast fleet was beaten despite being supported by more than 40 independent captains.

# Highguard Herald
**By Jaylus of Highguard**

**Synod service**

There have been a large number of judgements placed in the past season, something that is incredibly pleasing to see. Increasing participation in the Synod is a worthy goal that we should all work towards. While space is limited I will try to give some clarity for lay people on some of exceptional good work of the Synod.

The civil service proposed a [[Symposium]] to discuss spiritual and metaphysical matters – another
statement of principle by the Synod invited “priests and religious thinkers of the Grendel to attend
the Synod's Symposium so that we may engage in comparative theology between our two ways of beliefs.”

It is great to see the inclusion of other beliefs in the Symposium, though I wonder why we extend the invitation to our enemies first as opposed to our friends in the Hierro Orc clan.

The architects behind a plan to build an Asavean temple will be subject to an [[Inquisition]]. It is good
to see those responsible for pushing through the construction of the Asavean temple brought to inquisition. Their actions show a distinct lack of Wisdom and [[Vigilance]] and could have devastating effects on the spirituality of our glorious Empire, especially those near the idolatrous monstrosity.
Ongoing discussion of the constitution’s statements about orc spirituality is vital. This should not be seen as an attack on orcs but simply an effort by the constitutional council to better explain its understanding of the eldritch document that is our constitution. Though, in this writer’s opinion, the orcs of the Empire should be considering looking into their own spirituality, which has been proven by the Hierro Clan orcs to be separate from The Way but intrinsically linked to the virtues, but until then the more input into the Assemblies the better it is for all.

An effort to excommunicate the Synod of the Sumaah Republic failed. While this writer is glad
that this [[Judgement]] did not pass I must say Dietrich Elias der Holburghan should show Pride in his
actions, it shows great [[Courage]] to condemn another nation and to attempt to shape Imperial foreign policy. I hope we can invite a Sumaah delegation to the symposium to open dialogue.

An inquisition can be welcome news; consider this: ‘Inquisition of Asenath of Felix's Watch regarding her virtuous actions.’ After the Battle for the Bridge, Asenath kept the [[Sentinel Gate]] open to allow survivors and the bodies of the fallen through. This was at great risk to herself but she strove to save as many as she could. 

National questions are often raised in the Synod – at the past summit we saw Navarr being called to fight for the Blachthorns, Imperial Orcs asking to choose a tribal name and Duke Ferarro being sent into the troubled area of [[Feroz]] in the Brass Coast to preach Loyalty.

For Highguard national questions spring from The Way. For example Gravus of the Shatered Tower
will go to Reikos to preach isolationism. Or Jared of Couros who used a Synod statement to call for
all to rejoice that “the Soul of the [[First Empress]] has chosen to return from Beyond the Labyrinth of
Ages and now resides reborn within Sister Yael of Felix's Watch.”

The rise of the cult of the first empress is a worrying development for The Way, the wording of this
Statement of Principle is sound and indeed we should pay heed to her message regarding the land
without tears. However, we should show vigilance to ensure that we do not have another issue
in a similar vein to Golan [[The Wanderer]] that plagued Reikos for the past year. Furthermore, we
need, as an Empire, to ensure that we do not accidentally slip into idolatry in our worship of the First Empress as I have witnessed far too many people do so far. However, safe travels to Jared, may he show Wisdom in his teachings.

# llofir in reikos to stay?

Anvil [[Heroes]] have discovered that the heralds of the Eternal Llofir in Reikos have been invited
into the territory by unknown parties. During a mission to rescue a number of Highguardians trapped in their [[Chapter]] house, a delegation of heroes from the nation, alongside the [[Archmage]] of
Spring, were beset by aggravated heralds of the eternal. Thanks to the diplomatic skill and Virtue of the leaders of the delegation the heralds were kept at bay with minimal violence.

While there was some debate as to what was needed within the chapterhouse, and even unvirtuous suggestions of abandonment, it has been decided to fortify it.

# Herald was once highguard

Asolitary herald near a powerful spring [[Regio]] has said that she was once a member of Highguard.
Humans can shed their identity and join the realms of the Eternals, but it is highly inadvisable
and shows a distinct lack of Wisdom and Pride.

This particular herald further claims to be the result of a human member of Highguard breeding
with an eternal. This has raised the question of kinship and national identity within the nation.

Many exclusionists believe that to surrender to an eternal is final and are beseeching the Conclave
to remove amity from her. It is clear some humanity remains within her, as witnessed with her
desire to reside in her old chapterhouse. While to many it is a sensitive subject, this provides Highguard with the perfect opportunity to bring our relationship with the magical [[Realm]] into the light while deciding the fate of one more lost person.

# The laughing [[Cambion]]
For the first time, The Laughing Cambion frowns. The Synod’s Virtue Funds that it used to reward the virtuous were stolen from the Empire. You have stolen from the heart of The Empire. All of our agents will listen. All of our agents will seek. Surrender yourself to the mercy of The Synod and the Magistrates. If the Laughing Cambion finds you, you shall smile no more. But, we are not without mirth. The Empress has told another wonderful joke. She offers a reward for revealing our organisation. She’ll give true liao for information on our whereabouts, and the return of 500 Thrones stolen from "the Empire." Tell me, is the Empire missing 500 Thrones? No.

The Laughing Cambion isn’t either, funny that. Only The Butchers lost out. Let us assure
you of one thing the money is still in The Empire. The Laughing Cambion believes in Prosperity.
The Empress believes it is a greater crime that money is taken from the Butchers’ Bank, than the
Synod. It is no surprise that our Empress created spontaneous auras of the false virtue of hope. You
would have thought that her sign offering a reward would become hallowed with how hopeful and
lazy an effort it was to mislead. Of course, now we have two Empresses. It is so hard to tell which is
better. Yael, the First Empress!

Virtues be praised. According to her, it has only taken 350 years to return from the Labyrinth. Oh
don't worry about human destiny everyone, it turns out that once you transcend the Labyrinth you
just come back again. I'm sure we have a word in the Synod for that sort of talk... Funny too that Yael made no [[Testimony]]. That she had no affect on the world until after her vision. Isn't it strange? Normally, when people are shown visions of hope in the labyrinth, it leads them off the path of reincarnation. But of course, Yael must be a paragon. Only paragons can perceive the labyrinth, to transcend it. Because there’s no way the [[Cardinal of Loyalty]] would mislead people over spectres of
false virtues and aid a fellow from Highguard in accumulating power. Yael must be a Paragon,
it's not like they ever need Synod approval, right? We are not your enemy Lisabetta. The enemies of our Empire are plain to see. Never before has the Empire’s virtue Fund been robbed.
Never before have we had an Empress of the false virtue of hope. It is time to stop hoping and start fighting for your Empire, because the first empress is coming, and the people are so lost that they will follow Yael stories before Lisabetta. Lisabetta: save your Empire, or it will be taken from you. I'm sorry, friends. Next issue I shall be back on form. It must have been all these parties.

# Crane vs grendel

The younger Academy students have not been idle, Eva Fletcher from the Marches and Sovica
Martova Kovar from Varushka, told Academy Adventures about their recent trip to acquire
crane feathers and eggs. 
After finding broken eggs and bloodied feathers they discovered a local man who had been brutally beaten and left for dead by Grendel raiders. Their timely help to get him to his house and [[Heal]] his injuries was much appreciated. The scholars of [[The Academy]] have developed a theory that the Grendel were killing and eating the [[Birds]].
Yana of Varushka was particularly brave on this mission and helped to encourage the smaller children in finding their Courage. I wish the people of Sarvos luck in locating the intruders before more Imperial citizens and wildlife are attacked.

**“Train Hard and with Spirit”**
**By Sagua i’Ezmara**

Summer was a busy summit for the Academy students, who crafted crowns and bracelets, put
on a play for our new Empress and even created a floral crown for the coronation!

Congratulations to Faustina Notturno di Sarvos who was electedto the newly created position of
dean of students with the support of the entire senate. The dean of students has the power to raise one motion before the senate each year - an important power which the dean is expected
to use to help the academy and young people of the Empire

# Defeating dire druj death blossoms
The Academy’s cadets have discovered that the Druj are spreading deadly death blossom
plants across the wilderness along on the border of Navarr and Urizen.

While on a mission through [[The Sentinel]] Gate from Anvil, cadet leader Thelman touched one of the
black flowers and collapsed. His hand was instantly covered in agonising blisters that spread up his
arm. Only the quick actions of his fellow cadets and expert treatment at the Anvil hospital saved
him from a painful death.

Death blossom are large black flowers that grow on long vines. Their leaves are similar to ivy and the blooms have overlapping petals like a rose. Because of its poison a death blossom must be
treated with extreme caution. In conversation with Academy Adventures writer Sagua i’Ezmara,
Lucan Yanovich from Varushka said, “If you find death blossoms contact Ham of
Wintermark immediately and make sure you do not pick them up or touch them.”

Lucan explained that Ham from Wintermark is an apprentice of the Winter Eternal [[Wise Rangara]]
and – to Lucan’s knowledge – is thus far the only citizen of the Empire able to touch the flowers
without being harmed.
