**Winter 380YE**

# Throne liberates orchard’s watch


[[The Empire]] struck a decisive blow against the [[Jotun]] as [[Empress Lisabetta]] took the field at the head of an army of [[The Marches]], [[Wintermark]], [[Dawn]], League and [[Imperial Orcs]] to insure Imperial
presence in [[Mournwold]]. 

Carrying a Jotun Queen’s sword as she crossed the gate from [[Anvil]] to the Mourn on the Sunday
of the Autumn Festival Empress Lisabetta said, “What I do, I do as a horror to the orcs and a beacon to our troops.” Wintermark’s shield wall repeatedly swept across [[The Battlefield]] inflicting crippling losses on the Jotun force which was trying to exploit a magical [[Regio]] of Summer eternals in a ravine near the Orchard’s Watch fortress.

Dunhearth [[War]] leader Axhind said, “When I saw the Jotun were broken I ordered a pursuit through the woods. It was like letting the dogs off the leash. And the smiles on our bannerbearer’s faces was my reward.” The soldiers of the Mark took four Jotun banners and many harnesses of heavy magical armour. [[The League]] sent a small team to the regio and escorted the heralds of summer safely away.

The sword carried by Lisabetta was a coronation gift from a Jotun queen and was awarded to [[The Throne]] with a challenge to carry [[The Blade]] into battle against the Jotun. Danettice Vandatu of Dawn was named field marshall in overall commander of the battle. She said, “The fighters of the Empire battled gloriously. As a result the people of Overton threw off the yoke of the oppressors.
The [[Singing Caves]] [[Mithril]] [[Mine]] is returned to Marcher hands.” Dawnish [[General]] of the Gryphon’s [[Pride]] Soldier Akella and another Dawnish knight Lady Nym Orzel were both captured and tortured by the Jotun during the battle.

# Senate “power grab” leaves soldiers unpaid

The leader of the Constitutional Court, the Empire’s highest legal authority, criticised a recent [[Senate motion]], which will leave some commanders unpaid after committing their troops to battle.

Magistrate Abraham said, “This power grab is drawing control from independent nations and bringing it within the militia council.” Military units will now only be paid the guerdon monetary
reward if they follow the orders of the military council, overturning centuries of free leadership by individual unit commanders.

Under the new rules, military commanders who do not obey the Quartermaster General of
the Imperial Armies, who is selected by the military council, will not receive compensation
for the actions of their units in service of the Empire. Quartermaster Dan Brackensong selected
just four armies that will pay the guerdon to supporting units.

Abraham said the change was based on institutionalised deception and aimed to centralise
power in the Senate. “Our constitution demands that the military council can dictate the
pursuit of war free from influence by the Senate.”

In a scathing review of the capacities of the Senate and its stated motivations, Abraham
dismissed the notion that some generals had occasionally protected their own followers or
armies that were not fighting as “false arguments.” He continued, “The real reason is to concentrate
power in the hands of the central government. So that the military council no longer needs to solicit the help of the many commanders gathered at Anvil but instead will force their obedience through the complicity of the Senate.”

Wintermark [[Senator]] Hengest Dun expressed surprise at the generals’ actions, and regret at
the narrow choice given to commanders. He said, “Limiting the guerdon was meant to stop private
forces supporting armies that are resting. Not to restrict contributions to a select few armies. I think perhaps that individual’s personal [[Prosperity]], [[Ambition]] and pride are being impinged and I’d love to hear what the appropriate assemblies have to say about it.”

The generals supported their new power. Alusair "Flowers" Farstrider, general of the [[Bounders]] said “I think as generals we need to talk to our [[Military unit]] captains more. All too often I hear that they feel the Military Council just expects them to go where we want. As in this case when the guerdon is being directed, I can understand why it is, but it is not something I like doing. As a whole, we as generals need to let them know they are a massive help and influence in the war, and not to be taken for granted.”

Jericho general of the [[Highguard]]’s [[Valiant Pegasus]] army said, “Armies imbued with certain
magical effects will benefit by additional military units being assigned to them and thus create
more enemy casualties, or fewer Imperial ones. Citizens are strongly encouraged to support
the Military council currently. The guerdon is to reward those who act in the imperial, rather
than national or personal interest. Alternatively you could raid. The guerdon is to reward fighting
where the Empire needs it.”


# hunted by walking plants jotun escape [[Navarr]] vengeance

Despite being caught between invincible poisonous giant walking plants called valorn and Ulric Y’Basden’s Navarr, High guard and [[Varushka]], a Jotun army managed to flee [[Liathaven]].

The Empire force that went through the gate at Anvil on the Saturday of the Autumn Solstice
379 YE suffered few casualties but did not manage to destroy the Jotun. General Ulric of the Blackthorns was appointed [[Field Marshal]] as the Navarr pursued their merciless campaign to regain
the Liathaven.

The defeated Jotun who were attempting to escape the battle in small [[Bands]] were already
under attack by the animated plants and poisonous miasma of [[The Vallorn]], when Ulric arrived
by the gate at the head of a contingent of [[Heroes]] from his native Navarr, as well as Highguard and Varushka.

In the final act of the battle Ulric’s soldiers blocked part of the Jotun force at a gate where in
a chilling speech he repeated his threat to leave no survivors. All of those Jotun were slaughtered.

However, despite brave opposition by Empire forces many of the barbarians had managed to escape already.

Varushkan Priest of [[Courage]] Ezys said, “General Sullik commander of the Varushkan army of the [[Northern Eagle]] went boldly to meet his enemies with his sword in his hand and his faithful mouse at his belt. Despite evil powers and foul miasma he showed his enemies the courage of Varshukan soldiers.”

# giant crabs attack

Grendal slavers and giant crustacean monsters landed on the south coast, captured civilians and inflicted a punishing defeat on a band of heroes that used a conjunction to attempt a rescue mission on Saturday of the Autumn Festival. 

The disciplined Stone Born Grendal defeated approximately 60 heroes from Dawn, the Imperial
Orcs, [[The Brass Coast]] and Varushka. Delat of House Orzell negotiated alone with the Grendal captain and agreed a ransom to recover about a dozen prisoners lost to the orcs in the failed assault. The freed prisoners said the elite Grendal unit set sail richly laden with potions,
herbs, coin and [[Magic Items]]. 

An earlier band of raiders and crab monsters were forced to flee with some civilian prisoners
they had captured. Their war beasts were killed. Dimitri of the Salty Butchers in the Brass Coast, who was one of the heroes who chased off the earlier group of raiders, said, “We wore yellow
trousers and we did pretty well. But some of the Grendal ran off again in their boat.”

# throne gives senate’s money to grendal
The Grendal were paid 150 thrones of the 250 thrones the High Consul promised the
barbarian nation in the Summer. Empress Lisabetta wielded the hand of the chancellor to pay the
money from the Senate budget. It is the first time she has used this power to unilaterally spend
up to a third of the Senate’s cash after upkeep of the military. Bloodcrow Ergot said, “At least
only part of the money was paid. Perhaps the Throne listened to the advice in my column
in previous edition of The Oathwright?

The humans still do not understand that to stop the Grendal you must take money from
them, not pay for their weapons and ships. Were the two hostages [[Worth]] that money? Perhaps
to restore their Pride and [[Loyalty]] they should repay their debt to the treasury.”
# orc beats [[Eternal]] champion
In a brutal [[Fight]] Imperial Orc Senator Irontide Vio defeated the Champion of
the Eternal [[Eleonaris]] and won a magical banner. Irontide Vio is a well-known
orc pit fighter who has a long list of victories to his name. Also know as the Queen of
[[The Fields of Glory]], Eleonaris is a Summer Eternal interested in martial matters, particularly banners and heraldry.

# jotun crush blackthorns
The recently enlarged Navarr Army, the Blackthorns, was all but destroyed by Jotun
warriors in Beacon Point. The force suffered more than 3,000 casualties as the normally
honourable Jotun paid back the Blackthorns in kind for its own merciless tactics. The Navarr army is now cut off in Liathaven.
# peace overtures in [[The Barrens]]
Fighting continues in the Carmine fields and Murderdale in the Barrens. But talk
of peace has not stopped. House Vexile of Dawn were subject to an [[Inquisition]] for proposing
peace without Senate approval. Wintermark Senator Hengest Dun said, “We cannot afford to
lose to the Jotun. I would give up half of the Barrens if the terms were good.”

# dispatches

Lasambrian orcs landed in [[Redoubt]], [[Urizen]], supported by Grendal. Thanks to the spying [[Magic]] of the Helioptocon, Urizen troops responded rapidly and held the attackers to a small beach head.
However, the barbarians have now struck inland in tworaiding parties.

The army of corpses that emerged from the lake of Semmerlak and attacked [[Astolat]] in Dawn is motionless in the haunted Woods of [[Weirwater]]. Although the undead have not moved all who attempt to travel in the forests are killed. The Jotun retreated from [[Kahraman]] in the Brass
Coast. Their Summer soldier allies were defeated. The Serra Briante has been [[Liberated]].

# Civil Service Identifies [[Conjunctions]] Early
For the first time in several years the Civil Service has identified the major conjunctions
before the beginning of the coming festival. The major conjunctions permit one large
force of champions to travel from Anvil through the [[Sentinel Gate]] on each full day
of the festival.
There is a choice of two conjunctions that will open on Saturday both leading to Redoubt in Urizen: one near Elos and one near

the hospital [[Spire]] of Evenstar. Both are suited to fighting the Lasambrian Raiders. On Sunday there are three suitable conjunctions: two in Liathaven, which could be used to help the embattled and
trapped Blackthorns, one by helping them to fight, the other to help them escape. The third is in Mournwold, which provides a strategic opening to identify the Jotun’s plans for the coming season.

# Towards a doctrine of destiny for imperial orcs

The Oathwrights of the Imperial Orcs have well defined what it means for one of us to cross the Abyss and how that spiritual journey is different for Imperial Orcs.

In the previous edition in “Roadmap for Freedom” (Oathwright 2, P.4) I proposed three doctrines for the [[Symposium]] to discuss.The first two (The Doctrine of the Abyss & Ancestors) have been worked on by Bonewall Rek and Bonewall Cole. The third doctrine is something I have come upon on my journey as an Oathwright, listening to the voices of my Ancestors and understanding the
bonds that change us. These are works in progress and will no doubt be refined.

According to this doctrine orc souls do not reincarnate and therefore are created stronger
than other souls, as there is only one chance for their soul to make it through the Howling
Abyss. Those that cross the Abyss become Ancestors and can be heard by their [[Family]] and
friends they knew in life. 

To become an Ancestor you must earn your legend in the eyes of your people and our Ancestors so that you may have the strength to pass through the Abyss. There are three sets of voices that all orcs can hear: the loudest are our barbarian Ancestors, then our slave Ancestors and finally, quietest of all, are our Imperial Ancestors. Imperial Orc Destiny The voices of the Imperial Orc
Ancestors are quiet because they are few. But it is the destiny of the Imperial Orcs to be the
greatest voice heard from [[Across the Abyss]]. This doctrine calls on all orcs to make the voice of the
Imperial Orcs a clarion call that silences the treacherous barbarian voices of the Ancestors that betrayed our kin.

# Ploughsshares into swords
Bonesetter Bloodcrow Yargol’s vision of Prosperity is also a vision of Loyalty. Thanks to our new permanent home in [[Skarsind]] he is now able to to build sinecures and ministries for our people.

Those who are excelling in particular areas of economic activity are being awarded a [[Sinecure]]
to support their discipline. The award gives them the choice to take up arms as a captain of a
military unit, further bolstering the mighty Legions of the Imperial Orcs. And increasing the
number of orcs able to vote.

# Stormcrow cursed for role in fatal meteor raid
The Dunnings of Wintermark condemned a stormcrow to be cursed for a year after his advice was held responsible for a night raid that left [[Warmage]] Colas Dunning dead. After a large fragment of the Stalker Comet fell in [[Kallavesi]], Wintermark launched a 12-person raid to recover it. The
piece, likely containing valuable illium was known to be lying in a haunted marsh. Stormcrow Gunnbrand Ironwill advised the hastily-gathered team that he knew the situation and
insisted a party mainly of priests, known as stormcrows in Wintermark, and mages rather than
warriors would be needed to combat the wraiths and recover the star material.  His instructions were followed despite the ready availability of many banner-bearers who had attended the late-night call in heavy armour.

Gunnbrand was tragically wrong. The area was infested by ghosts not wraiths, and a shortage
of warriors – just six in the party of twelve – left the raiding party outmatched. Coenwulf
"Cola" Dunning, a venerable [[Steinr]] battle [[Mage]] was killed.

Cola had won renown by taking the field through the gate from Anvil festivals for a year. His
body was not recovered. Tobrytan Thane of the Dunnings interrogated Gunnbrand and demanded
he be cursed with the [[Freezing [[Brand]] of Irremais]] which was applied by Sirus Skybreaker and Ingar
Ironbreaker in a public ceremony in the Wintemark camp.

Still wielding the bloody knife he had used to apply the [[Curse]] Ingar said, “Grimbrand lacked
[[Wisdom]] and [[Vigilance]], but proved his Courage by accepting the curse we laid upon him.”
The painful ritual left him with a scar on his hand which will force him to tell people of his
dishonour whenever he is asked about the scar in the next year.

# [[Iron Confederacy]] struck by the light of the empire
*Lady Rannae Ygraine De Rondell of Dawn went to a party in the Iron Confederacy, a loose affiliation of duchies to the south west of the Empire. The region is suffering from the*
*plague known as the [[Reikos flux]]. These are her observations of unfortunate times in a foreign land.*

Social Events are not improved by the attendance of heresy, slavery, insurrection or the [[Reikos]] Flux. No matter how bright the rest of the guest list – the party will be dimmed by bloody vomit, noisy insurgents and noisier heretics.

Such was the party held by Baron Guiscard of the Iron Confederacy to celebrate the
founding of a new duchy in the newly- conquered lands adjoining the Empire. The Iron Confederacy is a territory close by [[Madruga]], of the Brass Coast. Furthermore, it is a pagan place,
where the locals worship night eternals dressed up in a mummers' farce as divinities. They preach that the exemplary are no longer reincarnated and instead may ascend to a paradise which they refer to as the Land With No Pain, or the Land Without Tears.

Their physics and apothecaries are but pale shadows of those of the Empire, a great danger to
their combined wellbeing, especially as nearby there was an outbreak of first recorded examples
of the Reikos Flux outside the Empire. Perhaps if you are hoping for some kind of endless bliss in ‘heaven’ you don’t need to concern yourself with the health of your patients?
Thankfully, Lady Igraine Novarion was on hand to assist when the plague struck
and could suggest ways they may mitigate the worst symptoms and prevent many deaths.
It is also unfortunate that this slightly unhinged approach to theology has corrupted their
diplomats too. The Iron Confederacy have forged increasingly strong links with the Jotun in recent
years, joining them in destroying the Lasambrian Orcs. The two states' support of slavery has attracted the ire of freedom cultists led by the Heralds of the Eternal [[Irra Harah]] – an enemy of the Empire who has supported freedom heretics in the past – and once again they attacked
the Imperial delegates.

Lord Francis of the Iron Confederacy was brought to a more pro-Imperial stance by the repetition
of Rule One and staunch encouragement by [[Earl]] Bohemond de Rondell, Lord Zadkiel de Coeurdefer, General Skar of the First Legion and Senator Avisena i Ezmara i [[Guerra]].

There is little trust in this land – especially since the tales of the Marches breaking the Empire's
word to the Jotun reached them – yet the wit and charm of our delegates seemed to have made a
positive impact, and there is now hope of a change in the relationship between our people, perhaps even a suitable treaty with the more progressive duchies as they are now voluntarily repatriating Imperial citizens captured and sold to the Iron Confederacy by other nations.

# The fig leaf
*Fashion and entertainment from the deep wood by Bors Ybasden*

Fashion and the Navarr may not always be two words that are often closely connected but,
if we are all honest with ourselves, the Navarr are the most fashionable of all the Nations in
the Great Empire.

From season to season the Navarr are turning out with the most cutting-edge trends from Cory
Brackensongs ink to Bran Y’Basden’s magnificent beard.

The latest “must have” look comes from the Y’Basden [[Striding]] who – many noticed last
year – have been sporting some rather fetching leather masks. I have been reliably informed that
each is a bespoke design and, of course, one of a kind. Not content with setting the style of the nation in clothing alone, their annual Bar Night was the event of the season. The drinks menu included the staple “one-ring beer” and one-of-akind pricing system.

A new addition was some wonderful gin cocktails which did not last long. In addition to
this was the unique Y’Basden Booze Fountain, which caused no one to go blind.

# IN BRIEF

Castellan The herald of Summer Eternal [[Barien]] has said she will be at The Forge in Anvil
at 9pm on the Friday of the Winter Festival. She called for all who have faced one of Barien’s challenges or who awaits a gift to attend. Barien, the Iron Duke, is an eternal of Summer who delights in posing challenges for would be champions. The stars have disappeared
across the entire Empire. Only the starts above Anvil are still shining. Magically detectable
but not visible the dis-appearence is accompanied by a shroud that makes scrying difficult.
Friar Alyn of Hay’s preaching against the [[Imperial Bourse]] Private Auction as unvirtuous
is said to have reduced the goods available for sale. Thane Dogri Thulebane is planning to raid the [[Thule]] from his home in Crows Keep in Skarsind. He refused to allow agentss of the Imperial Orcs
who rule Skarsind to enter his home in pursuit of criminels. Refugees from Whittle in the Mourn have arrvied outside [[Tassato]] Mestra after fleeing the Jotun.

# interview with an elder statesman

As the head of the constitutional court, Magistrate Abraham has the final say in official [[Scrutiny]] of every bill passed by the Senate. A lifelong civil servant, Abraham had a fundamental role in establishing many of the rules and customs of Anvil and the Empire. He took time from his busy
schedule to sit down with me, Cormack Dun, at the Autumn festival. Dressed in a simple black robe, Abraham walks with a stick. A quaver in his voice points to his considerable age.

His many Anvil festivals have left him a little overwhelmed by the world, but as he sat with
some difficulty on the cushions on the floor of The Hub for a late-night chat he revealed a sharp
sense of humour, “Cushions?” He said, “We had no cushions when I sat in [[Judgement]] here. I
was a regular court judge for many years. Eventually they asked me to step down. They said
I executed too many people.”

He threw a sharp look around the almost deserted tent, as though seeking someone to condemn
there and then. The Highguard civil servant continued to grumble about “youth today” and the luxury he perceives in the sparse furnishings of the Hub. 

His most pointed criticism is aimed at the Senate. “The Constitutional Court reviews the
laws passed by the Senate to make sure that they agree with the guiding documents of
our Empire. While we are always available to advise senators on their motions they do not always submit them in advance. Yet it is so much more efficient to do the scrutiny first. Sometimes we make objections, sometimes, sadly, even then we don’t get the changes we want.” This sense of regret over the inability of the Senate is a thread we see again as conversation turns to Abraham’s great passions: economy and history. I ask him, “[[Hahnmark]] Senator Hengest Dun and Advisor on
orc affairs Bloodcrow Ergot have said that the price of the rarest resources is rising rapidly, devaluing coin. How would you describe the price trend over the past four years?”

“I'm a magistrate, not a business owner - so I don't know the latest prices of all things. But I
think the senator and the advisor have misunderstood how you calculate the value of coin if they
are only comparing it with the rarest resources. It would be more sensible to compare it to a
wide sample of goods - rather than focusing on the price of just the Bourse resources - which is
presumably what the senator and the advisor are doing.” Abraham is the leading authority
on Imperial finance. Asked about the Senate’s funding gaps his estimation of the Imperial
coffers is curt “The Senate is struggling.” “But when you say money is short you suggest it is more
than usual. The founders expected it to be a struggle. With fortifications, armies and great
works to pay for how could you not be short of money? There are always more projects than money.”

“Everyone always judges the Senate against recent performance. People seem to have poor
memories. It is almost as if they can’t remember anything from more than three or four years
ago. Why don’t they think back 10 years, 20 years or 50 years? If they did they might remember
that the Senate has been short of money more often than not.”

# new judgements of inquisition
In Autumn 380, the Senate granted the powers of castigation, vindication and penance as
additional judgements available to an Inquisition, alongside the judgement of condemnation.
Raised by the Conscious of the Synod Maximillian and seconded by the Urizen Senator Probus
these were created by myself Jorma Steelhail, the [[Gatekeeper of Courage]]. The powers have
been intended to be used as an escalation from Inquisition. The new verdicts are as follows:

The target is believed by the [[Assembly]] to be innocent of any accused Unvirtuous acts levelled
against them and/or be of a Virtuous disposition and is formally lauded as Virtuous.

The target is believed by the Assembly to have engaged in both Virtuous and Unvirtuous behaviour. The judgement recommends how the target can correct their Unvituous behaviour.
castigation The target is believed by the Assembly to be guilty of Unvirtuous deeds and nature and is formally rebuked. I have created these new powers to answer a need within the Synod and the Empire that the  judgement of Inquisition has been too often assumed to be a punishment. In fact, it is no more than an investigation into the Virtue of an individual. Before these new powers existed, the Synod could only escalate to condemnation, a writ reserved only for religious crimes, to use this for wider purposes would be an abuse of power - a [[Religious crime]] in itself. This has meant that out of the 78 formal Inquisitions performed since the death of [[Empress Britta]] in 376, 60 have had no recorded conclusions. That mean 60 folk who still have the question of their Virtue unanswered. This is wrong. People should not be able to hide from truth, the guilty must face their wicked actions and their false accusers must face their error when they have been shown to be wrong. That is what these powers are for, when a person is subject to an Inquisition, there will, now,
always be a conclusion and a public record. All in the Empire will know the nature of the investigation and its outcome.

The powers of vindication, penance and castigation can be used to recommend punishments
and rewards, such as the ceremony of [[Testimony]] upon an individual’s soul, curses such as the
Freezing Brand of [[Irremais]], or to commend a past-life vision.

I urge priests of the Synod to use the full potential of these powers to expose the Unvirtuous and exhort the Virtuous.

# synod schism

Both sides in the Yael issue have acted in an unwise and petulant manner. [[The Way]] is a
religion based on fact. We worship and follow the principles that we have determined
to be the absolute truth. Sometimes we seek out new ways in which we can pass through the
labyrinth to expand our theological horizons. 

Sometimes this is successful, such as in the recent case of Paragon Asher of Felix's Watch
who died while under the influence of True [[Liao]]. In many others cases it is not. What is being forgotten in this is that we have no proof of Yael’s claims that she has witnessed a post-labyrinth experience during a past-life vision and that she is the reincarnation of the [[First Empress]].

While we have little reason to doubt that Yael has witnessed something similar to what she
recounts, she has acted recklessly in her pursuit of fame and [[Glory]], assembling a cult verging
on the idolatrous. We must not tear Empire in two over this matter. We cannot decide now
and look for evidence later. Instead we should work to understand this exciting theological
conundrum and determine if it should be written into doctrine.

# discord over artefact shield
Horsa thane of Tyrshaltern said he was threatened with [[Excommunication]] for refusing
to give the powerful artefact Torchbrand, Shield of Courage, to the Assembly of Courage. Speaking to The Oathwright, the Wintermark warrior said, “I’ll give the shield to someone who has proved themselves through courageous deeds.”

A competition to find the most valiant person in the Empire may now be organised after Horsa proposed the idea and it was accepted by some in the Assembly of Courage. Ezys, Varushkan Priest of courage, said, “They should hold an annual competition to prove great courage.”
Horsa said he was given the shield by a champion from Dawn “who beat everyone he ever fought including an Ice Giant. I don’t know what the shield does, I’ve never used it. I do not think I need it.” Torchbrand is one of the Shields of the Seven Pilgrims. Historically it was borne by a champion
chosen by the [[Cardinal of Courage]]. The first champion was the near legendary Navar Kaya of Thornhaven who bore Torchbrand in battle for many years. The shield was eventually lost in
battle to the [[Druj]] in 367 YE.

# druj ambush children

Cadets who had went through [[The Sentinel]] Gate to deal with a Boggart infestation were instead ambushed by Druj and forced to fight for their lives. They defeated the orcs and saved
several wounded adults. The youths were led into the ambush by a traitor who told them a
story about a fake boggart infestation. Mirna from Varushka explained how when they arrived at
the scene there were no boggarts.

The man who had led them into the trap hid as waves of orcs attacked the young cadets and the
adults who had travelled with them. The parents were struck down by arrows before the orcs
moved in to try and take on the cadets, but the orcs underestimated the elite cadets’ Skills.

Two cadets nearly died, but they were able to defeat the Druj without loss, and apprehend the
traitor who had led them there. He claimed that they had threatened his husband and sister-in-
Winter 380 YE Page 8 law to force him to betray the Empire and lead the cadets there. When dragged before the Magistrate he pled for clemency, claiming loyalty to his family. Mirna said, “I think he was a traitor but I think he was also loyal to his family. He was very bad at maths as he was trading 25 of our lives, potentially, for only 2 of their lives.” The magistrate took the same view and sentenced him to death.

Sagua i’Ezmara said, “What concerns me is that the ambush was specifically targeting [[The Academy]] Cadets, claiming it was boggarts to draw them out. Is the Druj attack on the cadets
linked in some way to the fact that they are leading investigations into the dangerous and poisonous death blossom, which was reported in last season’s issue of The Oathwright? Perhaps they are targeting the future of the Empire to weaken us? In any case it seems the Druj have a
grudge against the Academy.”

# hall of boggarts
Day boggarts attacked the hall of worlds during the Autumn summit. These creatures
can feed on the [[Realm]] lore of magicians. The Academy’s younger members, many of whom are experienced with boggarts, were called in by the Conclave who recognised the severity of the situation and that boggarts would be unable to hurt those who still practiced the apprentice skill.
Olivia from Urizen was one of those involved and she said that they had to identify the lead boggart using questions and reasoning and then cast a ritual upon it to get a magical egg.
We can all be very glad that they were able to get to the bottom of this infestation and remove
it before any of our magicians were harmed.

# the [[Legacy]] of chancellor abronsius

I hope we are all aware of the wonderful work that the Chancellor Eldenheart has been doing at the Academy for many years now.

He retired in Autumn and had this to say, “It’s been a tremendous honour and privilege to have guided the Academy through its formative years at Anvil. None of it would have been possible without the [[Dedication]] of my wonderful faculty and indeed the students, whose consistent quality leaves me certain that the future of the Empire is in good hands.” One of the students, the current [[Dean of the Academy]], Faustina Notturno di [[Sarvos]], demonstrated the Wisdom and Vigilance she had gained under his tutelage when she dealt with a Herald of thew Eternal [[Prospero]].

The herald offered to lower the magnitude of a ritual to move the comet by 25, in return he asked that the Academy put forward and support a motion of his choosing. Knowing the value of the Academy’s support and the dangers supporting an unknown external objective might bring on the Empire the wise young citizen refused the offer.
