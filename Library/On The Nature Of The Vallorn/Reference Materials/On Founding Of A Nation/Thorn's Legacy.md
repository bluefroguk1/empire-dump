During the Anvil Vate Hunt of Spring 380YE the heroes of Navarr journeyed to Fever's Wake in Therunin. There, within a Winter regio, they found a stone egg encased in a solid container that could only be breached by casting six specific rituals, one for each of the realms. The egg itself empowers someone who is bound to it in the arts of Spring magic, it is also hallowed with an aura of Ambition, the ambition to connect all of the Vallorn hearts together using the trods.

More interesting still is the vision received when the ritual Skein of Years was cast on the egg. Below is the ritual first witnessed by Bledri Eternal, then the Eternal Family coven and finally thanks to an Arcane Projection "Witness to the End" was shown to gathered Navarri heroes at the Songs and Stories Circle in Anvil.

Two figures sit in a wood, between them sits a deerskin map. The details of the continent shown are unclear but the names of eight cities stand out clearly:

Terunel, Seren, BÃ©antal Dol, Liath, Tharunind, Hacynian, Emrys, and Cavan.

The woman speaks. "Thorn, We need to join the cities again. All eight must be joined."

"Think upon it for a moment." The man replies quietly. "Are you aware of the consequences, this is why they destroyed the Trods after the casting of the great ritual"

"As always, I welcome your wisdom and counsel. You're right, the ritual should never have been cast.". She consents and he nods in agreement with her words. "But it was cast. They would not listen and cutting the link between the cities is not the answer. The Orcs have run for their lives, our people are safe, but at what cost? We have to deal with what we created"

"Navarr, it is not your Empire." Thorn warns "They would not listen to someone of your station. You are not to blame"

"I am not to blame, but I am responsible" she replies.

He shakes his head, they've had this argument before many times "We can use the Trods to bleed out the Spring Magic," he suggests "it will take hundreds of years but we can do it."

"This should not be. If we join the Trods, and awaken all eight, then it can be killed. It won't be easy, but we can destroy it!"

"With what armies?" Thorn questions "There are none left. either killed by the Orcs or by whatever was created by the Great Ritual"

"There will be armies, we just have to give our people faith, a purpose to unite behind, to rebuild a new Empire that is strong enough to fight"

He looks down at her words, slowly painting intricate designs on a stone egg.

"I hope this works, how many times must we have this conversation?"

"Not many more," she assures him "Terunael will never be rebuilt, but one day there will be an Empire, governed by Wisdom not by Greed."

He places the stone egg into a small pouch and everything goes black.
