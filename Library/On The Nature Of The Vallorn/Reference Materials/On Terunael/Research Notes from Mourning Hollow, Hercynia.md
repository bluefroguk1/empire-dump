*While the mystery of Mourning Hollow was one of a time after the fall ofTerunael there were items and ruins of the ancient empire present that provided snippets of insight into the past. For a more detailed account of more of the history of Mourning Hollow please consult the book published by Garth of Renwaerd and Skywise Gralka.*

Initial Thoughts by scholars at the Darkhaven Wayhouse:

The area where Mourning Hollow now dwells was once a large Terunael settlement. Not too far a travel from Hacynia, the ancient city at the heart of what we now call Hercynia. It was famed for its learning and contained a Day  college and library that was dedicated to the Eternal Phaleron.

The architecture of the area was so impressive that it was often referred to as the temple of Phaleron, although there is no evidence of any ceremonial function of this place.

Several reports show that although Terun is ancient, it survived the fall of the Empire mainly intact and was in use by the Navarr, probably one of the largest inhabited areas in the region. It would probably be worth noting that if anywhere was to explain what happened with the Vallorn, then the one Terunal library that survived the destruction of their Empire is probably a good place
to start.

Ghosts are often in the clearing around the Regio that remains and it looks like it was once the site of much fighting between the Navarr and the Vard. We have little historical records of this however, but the Navarr ghosts will generally speak to people and they seem to be trapped in that time. Just avoid the ghosts of the Vard, they will attack the Navarri on sight. The ghosts have told us that this library was torn down by the Vard and they tried to defend it but it was set ablaze.

This doesn't tell the whole story though, since there is obviously something that happened after the war with the Vard that happened to the temple that the ghosts don't know about.

We know now that the area was part of a powerful regio, one that improved the casting of knowledge based Day magicks, although interestingly that regio is only linked to the realm of Day during the daylight hours. It would be interesting to find out more about it at nighttime, however that is too dangerous with the ghosts.

The regio itself will reduce the magnitude of the casting of 'Skein of Years', 'Bright Lantern of Ophis' and the 'Celestial Library' by two! This is a very powerful regio and I have not heard of anything reducing magnitude before. This means that with the third magnitude of Day lore you could cast Skein of Years mastered with only three mana crystals. There is also a powerful night effect obscuring something in that regio.



### Skein of Years Visions from Terunael Locations and Items:
#### Temple of Phaleron
*The marble pillars and remains of walls that were once a great library.*
Terunael artisans work tirelessly and meticulously building an impressive structure. Stone walls and wooden shelves stacked high with countless tomes. In the centre of the library sits the regio and a large wooden table its surface adorned with carved swirling patterns. Bloodstains fill these twisting paths, the surface of the table having been used again and again by vates.

Vard soldiers come. Without mercy they attack the library. Seventeen ropes are used to topple the pillars as the seventeen stars of the constellation of the great wyrm hang in the sky above. Everything burns.

#### Golden Bowl of Phaleron
*An ancient covenstone*

There is a hole in the roof, a circle where the sun light pours through and down onto the bowl.

There is fire, the temple is burnt, a vard warrior kicks the bowl, it bounces off a pillar.

It lays there in ashes on the floor.

You feel the library watches you

#### Navarri Candlesticks
*A pair of wooden candlesticks with swirling vines carved on their surface.*

A changeling works diligently, carving the wood as a young draughir looks on with a look of adoration. The work takes days, far longer than it should as the pair lose themselves in one another and in their surroundings. Whispered conversations are held and their love for one another grows.

The candlesticks come to sit on the shelves of an old library, illuminating shelves upon shelves of old books. The library holds other decorations that hint to its Terunael heritage.

Heavy boots stomp through rubble and ashes. A warrior in mail loots the candlesticks from the remains of what had once been the Temple of Phaleron.

#### Terunael Plate

*An old dinner plate owned by Darkhaven steading kept in good condition for its age.*

Bread and cheeses sit on the plate and goblets of wine are shared. A small group share a meal and grumble in hushed tones. They aren't happy being in Hercynia, it's just as bad as it was on previous visits. They find comfort in the fact that they will soon be returning to Beantal Dol.

"If it's in Hercynia they'll put blood on it anyway" one of the travellers utters, seeing the locals as little more than the Ushkan barbarians. They won't be here for long however they have only come to deliver news. Orcs have been spotted in the south. Two score and in family groups, they think it should be fine.

Beantal Dol will not fall.
