It is through the documents in this section and those from previous sections that we can start to paint a picture of the Navarri nation from its conception to its recent history.

Most noteworthy is the ability to start to narrow down a timeline in regards to the destruction of the Vallorn in Miaren. The past life vision of Lisabetta Giacomi von Holberg gives us insight into the final push against the heart of Seren. The strike was made during the reign of Giovanni, also known as the Peacemaker. This puts it at somewhere between 23 and 34YE.

Documents suggest that fifteen years prior to this Rhonwen laid the groundwork for the assault with her coven casting Wither the Seed upon the territory.

This section also provides avenues for future research into tools to help in battles against the Vallorn. From potential variants of the artisan items we use if we were to consult foreign nations to further investigation of sites from around the time of the fall, like Rhonwen's Fall.
