"History is written by the victors" is a common turn of phrase that in many ways is true. We feel the ramifications of Emperor Nicovar and similar individuals attempts to audit history to this day. It is only through attempting to keep bias out of reports and/or sharing multiple viewpoints that we will paint a broader and more accurate depiction of noteworthy events going forward.

Owing to my position as Advisor on the Vallorn my viewpoint on the reclamation of Westwood is decidedly focused on my oaths and as such I would find it difficult to write an unbiased point of view. I do however believe it worth sharing my views to ensure they are not lost to time and that the campaign isn't noted as a complete victory.

The following account is comprised mostly of reports and almanacs released at the time edited to past tense and elaborated upon in places by myself.

Sian Eternal.

In the winter of 381YE the Vallorn of Liathaven began to stir If nothing was done by the Spring Equinox then the vallorn would have expanded to consume West Ranging. That expansion would have seen its growth spent and it was theorised it would then return to its fitful slumber. If the vallorn had been allowed to claim West Ranging then it would have become entrenched there and removing it would have become as difficult as removing it from Liath's Heart. This would have also swallowed the northern end of the Paths of Lan Thúven, most likely rendering them useless.

The alternative was for a significant force of Imperial soldiers to engage the vallorn to push it back. The amount of force required was discerned through the casting of divination rituals, namely Eyes of the Sun and Moon, the Eye of the High Places, and Dreams in the Witch House by ritualists in Anvil. Scouts and spies working with the Liathaven spy network also helped give some idea of the strength of the vallorn's expansion.

There was no chance to strike against Liath's Heart - the core of the vallorn will always be where it is strongest. It wasn't weakened enough yet to be attacked. But if the Empire could absorb the strength of the vallorn as it pushed into West Ranging, if they stopped the expansion then that would drain the forest enough that the Navarr could sally forth to strike into the Westwood. If that was successful then they could permanently clear the vallorn from the entire region.

Following the Winter Solstice, the Navarr army of the Quiet Step, along with the Marcher armies the Tusks and the Bounders, fought the vallorn expansion in Liathaven. The attempted expansion was blunted, meaning that West Ranging was not infested.

By spring 382YE the Navarr had secured a victory over the vallorn of Liathaven. This was not the first time they had beaten back an attempt by the vallorn to spread its infection - the Black Thorns thwarted a similar event in Elerael only a few years earlier. Yet the Brocéliande expansion was a significant degree less focused than the attempt to swamp West Ranging. There, it was simply a natural shift as of water rushing in to fill an empty space left by the withdrawal of the Druj. The Liathaven expansion felt like something else, something more immediate. The vallorn itself possesses no sentience, of course, not as a human might understand it. Yet the thorns and vates of the Quiet Step were left in no doubt that there was a power in Liathaven that was not present in Brocéliande, something fell that had yet to reveal itself.

As predicted, though, the victory in Liathaven left the vallorn weakened in some fashion. The vates were clear - it was possible to do more than simply keep the vallorn at bay. There was an opportunity - bought with many lives and with many years of patiently walking the trods - to launch an attack against the Westwood that, if it was backed with enough force it could be sufficient to reclaim that region.

However, while the Navarr and their allies were able to drive the vallorn back from West Ranging, they did not bring enough force to bear to conquer the entire region. The woodland was seared with the hungry fire of Surut but enough remained that the Empire did not control the entire region. As such, Imperial forces were still at a disadvantage in Liathaven - especially if they were to move to attack Westwood. Without control of an adjacent region within the territory, they would suffer hardships for establishing a beachhead unless they could first secure their control of the rest of West Ranging.

Westwood was a part of the vallorn that had remained largely untouched by outside forces for over a thousand years. It represented a significantly greater threat than the forces the Navarr had already faced recently. This opportunity was significantly rare though. An attempt to defeat it was considerably a very risky proposition, but if they did not strike then it would be years before the vallorn was weakened enough to attempt such an assault again. Assuming, of course, that whatever malign force was present in Liathaven did not act first.

To aid in the situation the heroes of Navarr took advantage of a conjunction of the Sentinel Gate, they ventured to Liathaven itself, to a Spring regio there, and with the aid of Freeborn allies restored the damaged trods surrounding the western vallorn itself.

It was during the Spring Equinox of 382YE that Empress Lisabetta used her power of 'Defender of the Empire to remove control of the Quiet Step from General Brennos Brackensong. She did however appoint him her adjutant and reports following this decision claimed that his removal was to prevent him from immediately taking his army to fight the vallorn despite the Military Council advising against it.

In the end there was insufficient support for the Navarr to immediately take advantage of the opportunity. By summer no Navarr army was committed to the territory and the two Marcher armies that were campaigning there were withdrawn. For whatever reason, the Empire's eternal wars against their barbarian neighbours took precedence once more. Whatever the reason, the reality was that the priceless opportunity to fight the vallorn was almost certain to be missed unless something radical was done.

The hard truth was that there was simply no way that the Navarr could fight the vallorn without the help of the Empire. The reason that the Navarr worked so hard to found the Empire centuries ago was in part because it represented the best possible chance to turn the tide.

Without the support of the other nations the people of Navarr made the difficult choice to cast the Winter curse Wither the Seed upon their lost territory. Already burned beyond repair in places Liathaven would now see thirty years of the life there stifled; though that did include the unnatural vitality of the vallorn. It would take potent magic indeed to rouse it whist the curse hung over the land.

Shortly after the Summer solstice, the forest of Liathaven was severed from the network of trods that crisscrosses the Empire by unknown magic. As it is not imperial territory would be extremely difficult to restore those trods.

On a more positive note once autumn came around the trods had never been busier. The grey pilgrims of Highguard, a multitude of new travelers taking their first faltering steps in a dance that would lead them across the Empire and back again. The curious walkers of the Great Forest and a handful of their briar brethren, walked alongside the Navarr. Merchants from the west, with ox wagons and brightly coloured coats, eager to take the fastest route to the markets that make their hearts sing.

Another entity walked the trods this season. Having taken more notice of the Vallorn as it could be seen from where the eternal resided in Reikos, Llofir sent a few heralds out to better understand the trods and the phenomenon they contained. Closely monitored and accompanied by vigilant heroes of Anvil (predominantly of Navari, Highguard and Wintermark) the heralds took in what they were shown and at the Winter solstice returned to lofir to see what aid he could offer.

It is worth noting at this time that much of the lack of support for Navarr fighting the vallor, the poisonous threat at the heart of our Empire, was the stance that 'new warfronts should not be opened given the current number of wars against barbarians'. However, this season saw a magical bridge being built with the aid of a being referring to themselves as the 'Lady of the Semmerlak', believed at the time (and later confirmed) to be in the service of Eleonaris. Called the Golden Causeway the bridge allowed the Dawnish to invade Ossium. They made a tactically sound surprise strike on a new front, but a new warfront nonetheless.

It was also at the summit of the Autumn Equinox that the Empress declared her intention to address the Empire. Her words were spread throughout the nations before the Winter Solstice. In her address she spoke of the warfronts and of particular interest to the people of Navarr especially was this excerpt:

[[The Vallorn]] threat, spiritual and temporal, has rightly become a concern for the wider Empire. We must keep faith, with the Highborn pilgrims newly walking the trods. With those of all nations who agreed to share prosperity so that the cost is not wholly borne by Highguard. And with those Navarr who have stayed their weapons so that, together, we will strike more surely when the opportunity comes to us again.

While acknowledging that the war against the vallorn was a spiritual one she made it clear that she expected the opportunity to be abandoned in favour of other battle sites.

When the winter came the western forest of Liathaven subsided into quiescence. Its recent attempt at expansion had depleted its strength - and the Winter magic that now smothered the territory made it more difficult for it to replenish that strength. The vates still spoke of the opportunity to strike against the vallorn in Westwood, potentially driving it out and leaving it in possession only of Liath's Heart. The vallorn is a thing of unfettered fecundity however, and that window of opportunity was closing. By the start of the Summer Solstice 383YE the energies of the vallorn would have once again become strong enough to resist attempts to clear them with martial force and the opportunity to do was unlikely to come again any time soon.

Fortunately, the Empire controlled a beachhead in Liathaven - if they had not secured West Ranging from the Jotun, who had moved into the territory not long after the armies retreated, the challenge of fighting the vallorn would have been dramatically more difficult. Even so claiming the Westwood from its clutches would require significant effort. They would need to claim the entire region of Westwood before the start of the Summer Solstice. If even a tenth of the region was still controlled by the vallorn when the Solstice dawned it would slowly expand back to its full strength.

Llofir offered its aid against the vallorn in Broceliande and welcomed its heralds home with the intention of offering better help in regards to the vallorn threat generally. Unfortunately, the aid of Llofir was roundly rejected by the Imperial Conclave - in fact the eternal is now under enmity.

Owing to the mistrust surrounding Llofir and there was talk of the citizens who allowed its heralds on the trods being called to inquisition. Despite several prominent citizens being involved only Sian Eternal was called to defend her actions. The results are recorded in Judgement 74 of that summit.

Early in the new year of 383YE Ossium was finally conquered. Its custodianship went to Varushka after a good deal of debate over who should have dominion over the territory. Despite the expansion of the Empire no nation was eager to call the territory their own.

It wasn't until the summer that victorious Imperial forces finally won a decisive victory over the vallorn of Liathaven. They ousted it from West Wood and claimed not only the region but also an unlooked for treasure - a pristine weirwood forest ripe for development. During the summit of the Summer Solstice a Senate motion was raised to commission a new Bourse seat in Liathaven; the motion was later withdrawn.

The Empire had conquered West Wood. Along with West Ranging, which meant they now controlled two regions in the territory. The Jotun control four regions (and the territory), and the vallorn controls Liath's Heart.

Now that the Liathaven vallorn is down to one region it is stronger than before.

Its entire power focused in one place, experience of the war to reclaim Miaren shows that it is more dangerous now than ever before.

For the first time since the fall of Terunael it is possible to walk from Western Scout to West Ranging.

The victory was not without cost. One price that was paid was that the magical wonder that was the The Paths of Lan Thúven is no more. With the vallorn gone, the Night magic that empowered the paths likewise faded and unravelled.

It was a long year and a half for the Navarr, they fought not only physically but politically to ensure that they could all fulfil their oaths. At times it seemed the Empire was asking them to set aside one of their strongest hearth magics, the tattoo all Navarri share - the Binding of Thorns. The victory of the vallorn came just in time but it was a close-run thing. Had the opportunity been taken advantage of sooner then the armies would not have had to push against the Jotun in addition to the vallorn and the meddling of the Heirs of Terunael.

Again, a large cost has been paid by the people of Navarr. Their lost territory is scarred supernatural fire, the land is  blighted by Winter and sites of cultural significance are in the hands of the Jotun. More than that they remain the only nation since the interregnum have not liberated a territory that was once theirs despite the barbarians retreating completely for a time. Without security or defence, the Weirwood forest the Empire chose not to cultivate could also easily fall into enemy hands.

The reclaiming of the region is rightly celebrated by Navarr and the Empire as a whole, it is a distinct victory that has opened more routes of travel across the Empire and more importantly freed trapped souls held within the vallorn of West Ranging and Westwood. But it would be remiss to not ask, could more have been done?
